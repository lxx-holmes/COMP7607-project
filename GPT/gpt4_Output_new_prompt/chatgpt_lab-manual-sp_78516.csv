2,"A substantial increase in lending to nonprime borrowers contributed to the bulge in residential investment in 2004 and 2005, and the tightening of credit conditions for these borrowers likely accounts for some of the continued softening in demand we have seen this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical situation where an increase in lending to nonprime borrowers led to a rise in residential investment, followed by a tightening of credit conditions that contributed to a decrease in demand. It does not directly indicate a future policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of past credit conditions and their economic impact. The focus is on explaining the dynamics of the housing market and credit conditions rather than signaling an intent to adjust monetary policy in response to these observations."
0,"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that global economic growth is slowing down and there is a trend toward lower inflation worldwide, which could lead to lower inflation in the U.S. as well. This suggests that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, and instead, there might be room for easing to support economic growth and employment. The mention of ""disinflationary pressures"" aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies that the FOMC might focus on stimulating the economy rather than worrying about rising inflation."
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) assessment of the neutral level of the federal funds rate and its implications for monetary policy. It acknowledges a lower neutral rate compared to historical averages and the potential constraints posed by the effective lower bound (ELB). The statement also recognizes the associated risks to inflation and employment. This analysis is more about the framework and conditions under which the FOMC operates rather than a direct indication of a policy shift towards tightening or easing. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment and the challenges it poses for policy implementation, without committing to a specific policy direction."
2,"Overall, though shifts in business attitudes are difficult to measure, I believe that markets reward businesses that outperform their competitors and that, as demand picks up, companies will respond to opportunities to incorporate technological advances in production, communication, and organization.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the behavior of businesses in response to market demand and technological advances, rather than directly addressing the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It neither indicates a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather comments on market dynamics and business strategies. This statement is more about the general economic outlook and the adaptive nature of businesses, which does not directly relate to the immediate goals of monetary policy concerning employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's balancing act between fostering economic growth and preventing inflation, without indicating a current direction for policy change. It reflects the Committee's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as well as its goal of moderate long-term interest rates. The statement does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather emphasizes the need for a careful approach to managing the economy's growth in relation to resource utilization and inflation pressures."
1,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a strategy focused on reducing inflation, which implies a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation down. Describing the economy as being ""one recession from price stability"" indicates a willingness to accept the economic slowdown (or even a recession) as a trade-off for achieving price stability, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating growth."
2,"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering a review of its strategy, tools, and communication practices to ensure they are effectively achieving their goals. The mention of the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate, but the Committee is open to adjustments if necessary. This does not signal an immediate move towards tightening or easing but rather a willingness to evaluate and adjust as needed to maintain their objectives."
2,"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests that there are issues with the current understanding of inflation dynamics, but it does not specify whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of policy. The statement is more reflective and analytical rather than prescriptive, thus it is categorized as neutral."
2,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It merely indicates that the speaker considers the equity market as one factor in their monetary policy decision-making process. It does not suggest whether this consideration will lead to tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,It will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is underway of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is not yet on a strong and persistent growth path that would lead to full employment, suggesting that the FOMC may maintain or introduce policies to stimulate economic growth until more robust signs of recovery are evident. This dovish stance aligns with a policy geared towards easing rather than tightening to support the economy in reaching full employment."
1,"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes in taking early action to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which aligns with a hawkish stance. By advocating for ""timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint,"" the FOMC is suggesting that it would raise interest rates or take other measures to slow down economic growth before inflation and other excesses become problematic. This approach is intended to lead to more sustainable long-term economic growth and stability in both output and inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of past economic performance, noting the end of a recession and a robust recovery with strong GDP growth projected. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather gives context to the economic environment in which the FOMC is operating. The statement reflects on historical data and projections without suggesting a specific monetary policy action."
1,But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation, suggesting that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to take action (potentially tightening monetary policy) to ensure that inflation expectations are met. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation from rising above the target level."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the role of inflation in driving financial innovations in Brazil, which helped firms and households to economize on cash balances. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy in terms of tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on the effects of inflation on economic behavior, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy direction."
2,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the behavior of equity prices during different phases of the economic cycle, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on market dynamics that may be considered when evaluating economic conditions."
2,"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about the performance of economic indicators during a past recession, rather than a statement about current or future monetary policy actions. It does not directly suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the reliability of certain indicators in predicting economic downturns."
2,"By the same token, the effect of the interest rate channel on overall economic activity may be diminished by greater trade integration as changes in domestic demand are offset by induced changes in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for the interest rate channel's effect on economic activity to be lessened due to greater trade integration, which suggests that changes in domestic monetary policy might have a diluted impact on the economy because of international trade dynamics. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment in which monetary policy operates. It reflects an understanding of the limitations of monetary policy in a globally integrated economy and does not signal a specific policy direction."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee has decided to implement a more accommodative monetary policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or using other tools to stimulate economic activity. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support growth and employment when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general assessment of economic conditions in Asian economies and does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on international economic conditions."
2,"In April, prices of core goods and services--that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy--were unchanged for a second month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the core inflation rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remained stable over the two months mentioned. This stability in core prices does not directly suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it does not indicate a clear deviation from the inflation target. The lack of change in core goods and services prices could be interpreted as a sign that inflation pressures are not intensifying, which would not necessarily prompt a hawkish response, nor does it indicate deflationary pressures that would warrant a dovish response. Therefore, the statement is best classified as neutral, reflecting a balanced view on inflation without signaling a change in policy stance."
2,"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate; that is, the Federal Reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, which are its core objectives. It does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing but rather explains the conditions under which long-term interest rates can remain low. The statement is focused on the goals of the Federal Reserve rather than the means of achieving them through monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Today, just nine months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent--a larger decline than most FOMC participants expected in September.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant and faster-than-expected decrease in the unemployment rate, which could suggest that the economy is heating up and potentially moving beyond full employment. This situation might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and maximum employment. A declining unemployment rate is often associated with upward pressure on wages and prices, which could warrant a hawkish stance to maintain price stability."
1,"Expectations of price increases over the near-term--specifically, over the next year--have, in fact, risen noticeably on the heels of the actual increase in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is an observed rise in both the expectations of price increases in the near term and the actual inflation. This suggests that there is upward pressure on inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and align with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation expectations is typically considered a hawkish stance."
2,"First, insofar as recent productivity growth is concerned, I have a serious question about the quality of the data that we employ to measure output in today's economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the quality of productivity growth data, which is a technical observation rather than a direct indication of a future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the reliability of the data used to inform policy decisions, which is crucial for achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. However, it does not in itself indicate a direction for policy adjustment."
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the challenges that technological advancements and financial innovations pose to the traditional understanding and measurement of money, which complicates the implementation of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexities in the monetary policy framework due to structural changes in the financial system. This reflects a balanced view on the difficulties in applying traditional monetary policy tools in the face of evolving financial landscapes."
1,And the equity market itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices--a rise based apparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations' already robust long-term earning prospects.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about the rapid increase in equity prices, which may suggest the potential for financial instability or the formation of an asset bubble. When the FOMC notes such concerns, it often implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating in the economy and to ensure financial stability, which aligns with their goal of moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices. The reference to ""extraordinary rise in equity prices"" and the need to assess its implications for stability suggests that the FOMC might consider measures to cool down the exuberance in the equity market, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the expectations of real short-term interest rates without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It reflects a change in long-term projections rather than an immediate policy stance."
1,"Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has continued to rise, reaching a level of 9.1 percent, which is significantly above the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back down to its target level, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply and demand in the economy, thereby putting downward pressure on inflation."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an opinion held by a group of economists regarding the relationship between monetary policy and financial market bubbles, rather than indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it is considered a neutral stance in the context of classifying monetary policy direction."
2,"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic context and the effects of global trade expansion, competition, and increased productive capacity on American businesses and consumers. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the factors influencing price control and consumer prices. The mention of low prices benefiting consumers could be seen as dovish, as it suggests inflation is not a pressing concern, but the overall sentence does not commit to a policy direction. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment, which is a necessary backdrop for policy decisions, without indicating a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank"" implies that the central bank has the tools and responsibility to control inflation. This suggests a stance where the central bank is willing to take action, such as tightening monetary policy, to ensure inflation remains in check, aligning with a hawkish view that prioritizes the control of inflation, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve intends to slow the pace of asset purchases as reserves reach sufficiently high levels. This suggests a move towards tightening monetary policy, as reducing the pace of asset purchases would likely lead to a decrease in the excess liquidity in the financial system, which is consistent with a more hawkish stance. The action aligns with the goal of preventing an overheating economy that could lead to inflation exceeding the FOMC's 2% target."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining a low federal funds rate until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy (i.e., raise interest rates) until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a return to the 2% inflation target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed 2% for some time. This approach is aimed at supporting economic activity and ensuring that both employment and inflation objectives are met before considering policy tightening."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, highlighting the challenges to activity and employment levels. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather sets the stage for understanding the economic context in which the FOMC is operating. The focus is on the state of the economy rather than on specific monetary policy actions to address these issues."
2,"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current monetary policy action is being justified by a forward-looking approach that considers future output gaps and inflation. The Taylor Rule is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, specifically the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation. A forward-looking variant implies that the FOMC is anticipating future economic conditions rather than just reacting to current data. If the policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation, it indicates a proactive stance to prevent overheating of the economy or rising inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, hence a hawkish stance."
2,"In fact, the Federal Reserveâ€™s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 Homeownership The important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's Community Affairs Research Conference and the topic of homeownership, specifically mentioning the role of expanded access to mortgage credit in driving homeownership growth. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on research and factors that may influence economic conditions related to the FOMC's goals. It does not provide clear insights into future policy actions or the Committee's view on the current economic situation in terms of inflation or employment."
1,"During the period examined, the rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI-U for All Items.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the historical rate of inflation without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need for easing (which would be dovish). It is a neutral statement that reflects one of the economic indicators the FOMC monitors."
2,We are not seeing any evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a strong labor market has not led to excessive inflationary pressure from rising costs, which suggests that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This dovish stance implies that the current state of the labor market does not warrant an increase in interest rates to cool down the economy."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, given a constant economic outlook. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how market dynamics (specifically, the demand for long-term securities) can affect interest rates independently of the economic outlook. This statement is more about the mechanics of bond markets rather than a direct comment on the current or future stance of monetary policy."
2,We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the structure of the U.S. government in comparison to other countries that target inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it sets the stage for a discussion on how the U.S. government's form might impact the implementation of monetary policy, without providing a clear direction on the policy itself."
0,The cutback in residential construction has directly reduced the annual rate of U.S. economic growth about 3/4 percentage point on average over the past year and a half.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the U.S. economy has experienced a slowdown in economic growth due to a reduction in residential construction. This suggests that the economy might be weakening, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth and employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
2,One prominent example is with semiconductor producers and their need to dramatically alter the mix of production to meet demands of the high-tech and automotive industries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the semiconductor industry where producers need to adjust their production mix to meet changing demands. This statement is more of an observation about a specific industry's supply chain dynamics rather than a direct comment on monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stance classification."
2,"Many potential inflation targeters ask, ""Why not zero?""","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Many potential inflation targeters ask, 'Why not zero?'"" is a neutral statement as it does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a question or a discussion point regarding the appropriate level for an inflation target rather than a clear direction for policy action. The FOMC has a long-term inflation target of 2%, and this sentence does not explicitly advocate for a higher or lower target, nor does it suggest immediate policy adjustments. It merely brings up a topic of debate that could be part of the Committee's broader considerations."
2,"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing an observation regarding the growth in profits and recovery in capital expenditures without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It points out that businesses are accumulating cash rather than investing it, which could be due to various factors, but it does not indicate whether the FOMC should respond with tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is more analytical about the current economic situation rather than prescriptive about monetary policy actions."
0,"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of fiscal policy measures on household spending without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges the role of stimulus payments and unemployment benefits in increasing consumer spending, which is relevant to the FOMC's goal of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response to these fiscal measures. Instead, it points out that the future strength of the recovery will depend on further fiscal actions, which are outside the direct purview of the FOMC."
2,"Despite the prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4 In contrast, as noted, study of the role of committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5 Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to policymaking.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the academic attention given to the study of monetary policy rules and the role of committees in formulating policy, rather than indicating a specific direction of monetary policy stance. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy. Instead, it reflects on the historical and academic context of monetary policy formulation."
1,Funding of our current account deficit likely will become more difficult when home bias approaches its practical minimum.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concerns about the sustainability of financing the current account deficit, suggesting that there may be a need to attract more foreign capital, potentially through higher interest rates. This could indicate a tightening of monetary policy to maintain the appeal of U.S. assets to foreign investors, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Higher interest rates could help to counteract the risks associated with the current account deficit by making U.S. assets more attractive, but they could also have implications for the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the benefits of stable inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations, which contribute to reduced economic volatility and potentially make longer-maturity obligations more attractive. This statement does not directly indicate a future action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an outcome of successful policy management. It suggests that the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates are being met, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
0,"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy due to the absence of increasing inflation pressures. This suggests a stance towards easing, or at least not tightening, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The implication is that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there is no urgency to raise interest rates to curb inflation, which is consistent with a dovish position that supports lower interest rates to encourage employment and economic growth."
2,"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where corporate borrowers face difficulties in raising funds due to high costs or lack of access to credit markets, but it does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It reflects concerns about market conditions that could impact the broader economy, but without additional context, it does not suggest a specific policy action by the FOMC. The focus is on the observation of market dynamics rather than a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
0,"In the modal outlook, monetary policy tightening to temper demand, in combination with improvements in supply, is expected to reduce demandâ€“supply imbalances and reduce inflation over time.10 The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities, and with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that is expected over coming quarters, the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy tightening is being used to temper demand, which is a strategy aimed at reducing inflation by slowing economic growth. The mention of the real yield curve moving into positive territory suggests that the FOMC is aiming for interest rates that are higher than the inflation rate, which is consistent with a tightening monetary policy stance. This approach is typically considered hawkish, as it involves raising interest rates to control inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic activity."
1,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's actions to maintain low inflation are effective and that this effectiveness is reinforced by public expectations. It suggests a commitment to keeping inflation under control, which is typically associated with a tighter monetary policy stance. The reference to people being ""more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior"" indicates a desire to prevent inflationary pressures, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
0,"But low rates are not solely or even primarily a result of the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market's expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced economies.7 Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that low interest rates are a response to market expectations of low inflation and economic weakness, rather than being driven primarily by the Federal Reserve's own policies. This suggests that the environment is one where the Fed is likely to maintain an accommodative stance to support the economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy that focuses on stimulating the economy rather than tightening conditions to combat high inflation."
1,They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering the impact of higher energy prices on household income and spending, which is a factor in their assessment of economic conditions. This does not directly suggest a move to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows that they are monitoring economic indicators that could influence future decisions. The focus on real disposable income and spending demands reflects a balanced approach to understanding the current economic environment without a clear indication of a policy shift."
2,"Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the tools and operations the Federal Reserve uses to implement monetary policy, such as asset purchases and sales, repurchase agreements, and discount window loans. It also speculates that these tools could be used in a hypothetical situation where Treasury securities are not available. This statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses the mechanics of policy implementation. It does not provide information on the current economic conditions or the FOMC's stance on adjusting the monetary policy to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that current financial conditions could negatively impact economic growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract these risks and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate growth."
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term effects of monetary policy on the economy in relation to the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance of tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the need for forward-looking decision-making due to the delayed impact of policy changes. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the dual mandate over time without a clear immediate directional bias in policy stance."
0,"In particular, we are closely monitoring the emergence of the coronavirus, which is likely to have a noticeable impact on Chinese growth, at least in the first quarter of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is observing the effects of an external factor (the coronavirus) on economic growth, particularly in China. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows attentiveness to potential risks that could affect the economic outlook. The focus is on the impact of a nonmonetary factor, and the statement does not provide clear guidance on future policy moves."
0,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests an interest in exploring methods to control interest rates, specifically mentioning yield curve caps in conjunction with forward guidance that would delay raising rates until certain employment and inflation outcomes are met. This implies a strategy to keep interest rates lower for longer, which is typically associated with a dovish stance aimed at supporting economic activity and employment."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a method of approaching inflation targeting, suggesting that flexible inflation averaging might be a beneficial and more straightforward strategy to communicate. It does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather comments on a potential policy tool that could be used to achieve the FOMC's long-term inflation goal. The stance is balanced and focused on the method of communication and policy implementation rather than a change in the policy direction."
2,Developments during the Second Period: 1998-2007 Research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on past research and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It speaks to the understanding of uncertainty in monetary policy design, which is a foundational aspect of policy-making but does not suggest a specific direction for policy action."
2,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to two specific concerns: the zero bound on nominal interest rates and labor markets. The zero bound is a situation where interest rates are close to zero, limiting the central bank's ability to use traditional monetary policy tools to stimulate the economy. The mention of labor markets could relate to employment levels, which is one of the FOMC's mandates. However, without additional context indicating whether the FOMC is considering actions to address these concerns, the sentence itself does not clearly suggest a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely acknowledges two areas of focus that could potentially influence future policy decisions."
0,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about economic conditions, specifically productivity growth. An increase in productivity can be beneficial for the economy as it may lead to higher output without adding inflationary pressure, but the sentence does not specify how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response to this change. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"The remarkable coming together of technologies that we label IT has allowed us to move beyond efficiency gains in routine manual tasks to achieve new levels of productivity in routine information-processing tasks that previously depended upon other facets of human input--computing, sorting and retrieving information, and acting on pieces of information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of information technology (IT) on productivity, particularly in routine information-processing tasks. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on technological advancements and their effects on efficiency and productivity, which are factors that can influence the broader economic context in which the FOMC operates. However, this statement itself does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy."
0,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected outcome of currency depreciation on the price competitiveness of U.S. exports without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action by the FOMC regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Instead, it provides an analysis of the exchange rate movements' impact on trade dynamics, which is one of the many economic considerations the FOMC might take into account when making policy decisions."
0,"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the value central bankers place on credibility in the context of disinflation costs but does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a general statement on central banking principles rather than a specific policy direction."
0,"Although the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while unemployment is very low, which could suggest a tight labor market and potential inflationary pressures, the rise in wages is in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. This balance suggests that the current situation is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation that would warrant a hawkish response, nor showing signs of economic weakness that would require a dovish stimulus. The FOMC might view this as a situation where the current policy stance is appropriate, hence the classification as neutral."
2,"Central bank actions are designed in the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and thus the evolution of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism by which central bank actions, such as those by the Federal Reserve, influence the economy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is currently aiming to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general statement on how monetary policy operates by affecting asset prices and yields, which then impact economic decisions and the broader economy. This reflects an understanding of the transmission of monetary policy but does not signal a specific policy stance."
2,"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1/2 to 2 percentage points.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of trade with developing economies on the growth rate of import prices in industrialized countries, providing an analysis of the situation rather than indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather offers information on one of the factors that could influence inflation. The range of estimates for the reduction in the growth rate of import prices also indicates uncertainty, which supports a neutral classification."
1,But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting?"" does not explicitly indicate a direction of policy change towards tightening or easing. Instead, it poses a hypothetical question about the adoption of a strategy (inflation targeting) that could be used in various ways to achieve the FOMC's goals. Inflation targeting itself can be associated with either a hawkish or dovish stance depending on the specifics of the target and the context of the economy. Without additional information on how the ""soft form of inflation targeting"" would be implemented or what the target would be, it's not possible to determine if this implies a more aggressive or accommodative approach to monetary policy."
0,"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic principle regarding the negative effects of deflation, similar to those of inflation, on resource allocation and the economy's potential. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. The stance is balanced and does not suggest any immediate policy action."
2,The number of black-owned firms increased nearly 50 percent and the number of Hispanic-owned firms jumped 80 percent between 1987 and 1992--between two and three times the rate of growth of non-minority-owned firms.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical statistic about the growth of black-owned and Hispanic-owned firms compared to non-minority-owned firms between 1987 and 1992. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates that would influence the FOMC's monetary policy decisions. It is simply a statement of fact regarding past business growth and does not reflect a policy stance."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for financial markets to develop tools and methods to more accurately detect changes in the general price level. This statement does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a neutral, observational comment on the capabilities of financial markets to assess inflation, which is one of the FOMC's concerns. It neither suggests imminent policy action nor provides insight into the Committee's leanings on the direction of monetary policy."
0,"Moreover, the resulting robust gains in labor productivity have been well ahead of compensation growth and have dramatically boosted corporate profits.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that labor productivity has increased significantly more than compensation growth, leading to a substantial rise in corporate profits. This scenario suggests that the economy might be operating efficiently with less need for monetary stimulus. Higher productivity without corresponding increases in wages could lead to inflationary pressures if demand outpaces supply, which might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating. Thus, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, where the FOMC might consider measures to prevent potential inflationary pressures."
2,Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fiscal development regarding the budget balance, moving from a deficit to a surplus, and notes that this change was more dramatic than anticipated. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on fiscal outcomes, which are separate from the monetary policy actions the FOMC might take. The sentence does not explicitly suggest how the FOMC might respond to this fiscal development in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or altering its monetary policy stance to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical economic cycles and the causes of past downturns, specifically noting that financial imbalances, rather than inflation in goods and services, were elevated at those times. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in policy towards tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context and an analysis of past events, which could be used to inform current decision-making but does not in itself advocate for a particular direction in monetary policy."
2,The September FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved in August our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3 The changes we made in our September FOMC statement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural update where the FOMC's policy guidance is aligned with a new framework established in their Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an adjustment in their approach to policy guidance. The sentence focuses on the alignment with the new framework rather than the implications of that framework for immediate monetary policy actions."
2,But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price"" does not provide any specific information regarding monetary policy, inflation, employment, or interest rates. It is a general statement that could apply to a wide range of contexts and does not indicate a clear stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of higher and more stable growth on a country's fiscal outlook, which is generally a desirable economic condition. However, it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments such as changing interest rates or altering the money supply. It neither suggests a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather comments on the benefits of economic growth and stability."
2,"The Survey of Market Participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a shift in expectations following the release of the new monetary policy framework.17 The median expected rate of unemployment at the time of liftoff moved down from 4.5 percent in the July survey, before the release of the framework, to 4.0 percent in the September and subsequent surveys, following the release of the new framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a change in market participants' expectations regarding the unemployment rate at which the Federal Reserve might begin to raise interest rates (referred to as ""liftoff"") following the release of a new monetary policy framework. The shift in expectations from a 4.5 percent to a 4.0 percent unemployment rate does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects a change in the perceived threshold for policy action based on the new framework. This suggests a potential recalibration of the FOMC's approach to its employment goal, but without additional context on the nature of the framework or its implications for future policy moves, the stance remains unclear."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that certain measures of inflation (trimmed price indexes) are aligning with the FOMC's long-term inflation goal of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is neither too high nor too low relative to the target, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is simply an observation of current inflation metrics and does not in itself advocate for a particular policy action."
1,"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about high inflation levels and acknowledges uncertainty in the inflation outlook. This suggests a stance that would favor tightening monetary policy to bring inflation down towards the FOMC's target, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to reduce inflationary pressures, aligning with the goal of stable prices."
2,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to forecasting the economy's path towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability, taking into account the short-term variability in output and inflation. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather emphasizes the Committee's process for considering economic variations when forming their views. This reflects a balanced stance focused on achieving their dual mandate over time."
2,"August 26, 2022 Monetary Policy and Price Stability Chair Jerome H. Powell At â€œReassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy,â€ an economic policy symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming Share Watch Live Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is a formal introductory remark and does not contain any information about the stance of monetary policy. It does not indicate any action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is simply a polite opening to a speech and does not reflect any policy stance."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing educational and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather emphasizes structural issues in the economy that are typically outside the immediate scope of monetary policy tools. The FOMC's interest in such matters relates to its broader economic objectives, particularly maximum employment, but the sentence itself does not suggest an imminent change in monetary policy."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle regarding the Federal Reserve's long-term goals of maximum employment and price stability, suggesting that these objectives are not in conflict over the long term. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms the compatibility of the Fed's dual mandate in the long run. This reflects a balanced view without a clear immediate policy direction."
2,And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an understanding of the lag between policy implementation and its effects on inflation, without suggesting a specific direction for future policy. It reflects a neutral stance, acknowledging the time it takes for changes in monetary policy to impact inflation, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving stable prices."
2,"Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides information about the composition of the staff supporting the Board's monetary policy responsibilities but does not indicate a direction for monetary policy (tightening, easing, or maintaining current levels). It neither suggests an imminent change in policy nor provides insight into the Committee's stance on economic conditions."
2,"As you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexity of interpreting economic data for monetary policy decisions. It suggests that the process of using published statistics to assess the impact of monetary policy involves considerable complexity, but it does not provide any specific direction on future policy actions."
0,"To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it discusses an economic observation that could potentially impact domestic demand due to foreign producers' activities. This statement is more descriptive of economic dynamics than prescriptive of monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest any adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's commitment to maintaining inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent target, which is consistent with their mandate for price stability. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of managing inflation expectations over the long term. The focus on anchoring expectations suggests a balanced approach to achieving the inflation goal without specifying changes to the current policy stance."
2,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical aspect of economic measurement, specifically the challenge of separating changes in nominal values into real quantities and prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the complexity of defining a consistent unit of output for economic analysis, which is a neutral concept with respect to monetary policy actions."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past market reaction to expectations of the Federal Reserve reducing its asset purchases (tapering), which led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility. This reaction, in turn, affected emerging market economies (EMEs) by causing sharp declines in their exchange rates and asset prices. The sentence does not directly indicate a future policy stance but rather discusses the consequences of market expectations about the Fed's actions. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of monetary policy but reflects on the impact of past anticipations of policy changes."
1,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" if the unemployment rate declines to the projected 3.8 percent. This suggests that the labor market is approaching a state that does not warrant further easing of monetary policy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, achieving maximum employment without signs of overheating (which could lead to inflation) might lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Unfortunately, from the point of view of both the analyst and the policymaker, the link between an asset's price and the structure of its return is hard to pin down, as it typically embodies complex factors that are inherently difficult to measure, such as expected future earnings, riskiness, and risk aversion.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the complexity of understanding the relationship between an asset's price and its returns, which involves factors like expected future earnings, riskiness, and risk aversion. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the challenges that analysts and policymakers face when considering financial market conditions, which is a part of the broader economic environment they monitor. It does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future monetary policy actions."
2,Companies can keep their focus on cutting costs and increasing productivity; they can foster research and innovation; they can offer training and employee incentives to acquire more education and skills.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes actions that companies can take to improve their efficiency and productivity, which are generally positive for the economy but do not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The focus on cost-cutting, productivity, research, innovation, and employee training is more related to business strategies and labor market improvements rather than the direct tools of monetary policy such as interest rate adjustments."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been growing above trend for three years, which has significantly reduced economic slack (unused capacity). This implies that the economy might be operating close to its full potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this observation could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Case studies of individual industries show that, in some cases, the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the effectiveness of technological investments in certain industries and their impact on productivity and profits, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a signal of future policy actions."
0,"That said, our model accords the greatest roles to increased productivity growth, which has made the United States a magnet for foreign saving, and to the slump in foreign domestic demand, which has led to an excess of saving in those economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses factors influencing the U.S. economy, such as increased productivity growth and a slump in foreign domestic demand, which are not directly related to the immediate stance of monetary policy. It neither indicates an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions."
2,"First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a dynamic where trade expansion influences domestic inflation through the prices of imported goods and competition, but it does not directly suggest a policy action such as tightening or easing. It acknowledges a factor that affects inflation but does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. The FOMC might consider this information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
1,"During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the inflation rate is expected to exceed the long-term target, suggesting that there may be a need for tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the desired level. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Exceeding this target would typically prompt the FOMC to consider actions that could be seen as hawkish, such as raising interest rates, to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of temporary disruptions due to Year 2000 problems (often referred to as the Y2K issue), but it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. The statement that the effects are ""likely to be temporary and quickly reversed"" implies that the FOMC does not see a need for a long-term policy response, such as tightening or easing, in reaction to these disruptions. It reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as the Committee expects any impact on employment, inflation, or interest rates to be short-lived and not requiring intervention."
2,"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the approaches to monetary policymaking, noting a trend in the reliance on forecast-based methods among leading central banks. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the methodology of policy formulation. The focus on forecasting suggests an emphasis on data-driven decisions, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed policy-making but does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the central bank may need to create expectations of inflation to lower the real interest rate when nominal rates are at or near zero. This suggests a willingness to tolerate or even induce higher inflation, which is typically addressed by tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation. This statement is more of an observation on economic behavior and public awareness rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Moreover, to the extent that more-rapid growth of productivity shows through to faster gains in nominal wages, there will be fewer instances in which nominal wages will be pressured to fall.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between productivity growth and nominal wage gains, suggesting that with higher productivity, wages are less likely to fall. This statement does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation on economic conditions that could potentially impact inflation and employment, which are key considerations for the FOMC. The sentence implies that if productivity leads to wage gains without causing inflation to rise, the FOMC might not need to adjust its policy stance. However, it does not explicitly suggest any imminent policy action."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is more focused on the economic developments in EMEs rather than the domestic monetary policy stance of the Federal Reserve."
2,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context and rationale for the structure of the FOMC, explaining the benefits of a committee approach in terms of information aggregation and diversity of perspectives. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"It is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the limitations of macroeconomic policy in generating growth, acknowledging that while it can help create favorable conditions, it cannot directly cause growth. This statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a general principle regarding the role of policy in the economy. It suggests a balanced view on the impact of policy measures, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making based on a range of indicators."
1,"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that China's fluctuating COVID containment measures, particularly the revival of travel restrictions, pose an ""upside risk for inflation."" This suggests that there is a risk of higher inflation, which could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflation risks is considered a hawkish stance."
0,The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding global economic growth projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's policy actions or intentions. While such information could be used to inform the FOMC's decisions, the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy direction."
0,"Though widely anticipated even before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse course.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there was a recession and a decrease in employment, which led to pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse its previous course of action, likely meaning to ease monetary policy. This suggests a stance towards stimulating the economy and improving employment, which aligns with a dovish policy approach."
1,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, which suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched. This stance aligns with the goal of stable prices and indicates a readiness to act against inflationary pressures."
2,The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence states a fundamental principle of the Federal Reserve's mandate without indicating a current policy direction or change. It simply affirms the Fed's role in maintaining price stability, which is one of its core objectives, without suggesting whether policy will be tightened or eased."
1,"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that higher inflation could lead to lower economic growth in the longer term. This suggests that the FOMC might prioritize controlling inflation, even at the potential cost of slower growth, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too high. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
2,The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method of gathering information rather than indicating a direction for monetary policy. It explains that the FOMC presidents include anecdotal evidence in their reports to gain insights into regional economic conditions, which is a part of their information-gathering process. This does not suggest any particular action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about economic research findings regarding productivity growth and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that could inform future policy decisions."
2,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the rationale behind the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both inflation and output (employment) considerations. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the balance the FOMC seeks to achieve between these two objectives. The mention of ""flexible inflation targeters"" suggests that the FOMC is open to allowing some deviations from the exact inflation target to support the broader economic conditions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to policy-making."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a low federal funds rate is being maintained to encourage economic growth and to start addressing the significant underutilization of resources. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach. The focus on promoting growth and reducing slack implies that the FOMC is prioritizing stimulating the economy over concerns of potential inflation, which is characteristic of a dovish policy stance."
1,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that a vigorous response to economic bubbles, despite its traumatic impact, is preferable to a monetary policy that allows high inflation to persist. This implies a stance in favor of taking strong measures to prevent high inflation, which is associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The FOMC's commitment to stable prices often involves taking a hawkish stance to prevent inflation from rising above their target level."
2,"This conclusion is buttressed by recent sizable increases estimated for labor productivity for the manufacturing sector, derived from a data system that, for the most part, is independent of the national accounts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of increased labor productivity in the manufacturing sector, which is a factor that can influence monetary policy but does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing. Higher productivity can lead to economic growth without additional inflation, which might not necessitate an immediate policy response. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should raise or lower interest rates or adjust its monetary policy stance, but rather provides information that could be used to inform their decisions."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to take action to correct market prices if they are misaligned with the Federal Reserve's assessment of the economy or its policy intentions. This suggests a readiness to adjust monetary policy to steer the economy towards the Fed's goals, which could involve tightening if prices are too high due to an overly optimistic view of the economy or dovish Fed intentions. The use of ""prove them wrong"" implies a proactive stance in ensuring that market expectations align with the Fed's objectives, particularly regarding inflation control, which is a hallmark of a hawkish policy stance."
1,"The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy; in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflation expectations becoming unanchored and the difficulty this poses for monetary policy, particularly in terms of the increased cost of achieving disinflation. This suggests a stance that would favor tightening monetary policy to regain credibility and control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy is typically associated with raising interest rates to manage inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's primary goals."
2,The evidence suggests that new technology often results in more growth in employment in innovating industries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of new technology on employment growth in innovating industries, which is a general economic observation rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an insight into how technological advancements might influence employment, which is one of the FOMC's concerns. The sentence does not directly relate to the current monetary policy actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary tools."
2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy in the context of global financial dynamics, specifically regarding the impact of cross-border capital flows on domestic interest rates. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the challenges or limitations that the FOMC might face in achieving its goals due to external factors. The sentence is more about the consideration of external influences on policy effectiveness rather than a direct indication of a policy shift."
2,"Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the nature of productivity growth and its effects on demand but does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is an observation on how productivity gains are achieved and their economic implications, without a direct link to immediate policy action."
2,"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific direction regarding the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it offers to explain the functioning of the FOMC and the effects of monetary policy on the economy, which is an educational statement rather than an indication of policy stance. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency without suggesting any particular action or change in policy."
2,"The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad-woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the comparability of commodity prices over time and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the FOMC's views on current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting"" is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges a factor that complicates economic forecasting. Productivity growth can have various effects on the economy, potentially leading to higher output without additional inflationary pressure, but the sentence does not specify how the FOMC might respond to this complication in terms of adjusting monetary policy."
0,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to ease monetary policy by using a full range of tools to support the economy in response to increased downward risks to employment and inflation due to the constraints imposed by the lower bound of interest rates. This suggests a readiness to take action to stimulate economic activity and counteract negative trends, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes boosting employment and inflation towards the Committee's targets."
1,"Although the Fed hasn't started raising rates or reducing the balance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of market conditions where interest rates have increased, but it does not directly reflect a change in monetary policy enacted by the Federal Reserve. The statement is merely acknowledging a fact about interest rate movements without suggesting a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions. It does not explicitly convey the FOMC's stance on future policy moves."
0,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a general principle regarding the relationship between money growth, inflation, and the business cycle without indicating a current policy direction. It suggests that a stable rate of money growth could theoretically control inflation and smooth the business cycle if money demand is stable and not sensitive to interest rates. However, it does not provide information on current economic conditions or the Committee's present stance on adjusting monetary policy. Therefore, it does not clearly signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,Higher productivity is unambiguously good.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Higher productivity is unambiguously good"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it is a general statement affirming the positive nature of increased productivity. Higher productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not provide information on the current economic conditions or the FOMC's intended policy actions, so it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
1,"Consumer sentiment remains solid, and the employment picture is positive.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that consumer sentiment is strong and the employment situation is favorable, which suggests a stable economic environment. It does not explicitly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather presents a balanced view of current economic conditions. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations as a general principle of successful monetary policy, without indicating a current direction for policy adjustment. It emphasizes the role of expectations in preventing instability but does not suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC's 2 percent target over coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect inflation to approach the Committee's long-term goal of 2 percent in a gradual manner. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is aligned with their inflation objectives and does not explicitly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy. The use of the word ""gradually"" implies a steady approach towards the target, which is consistent with a neutral stance that is neither aggressively hawkish nor dovishly accommodative."
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical observation about the methodology of studies concerning price indexes and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather comments on the approach to measuring inflation across different income groups. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for any particular action."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the U.S. current account deficit and the trade balance, specifically the numerical difference between imports and exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the Federal Reserve in terms of tightening or easing. The statement is merely providing context or background information rather than signaling a policy direction."
0,The first driver is the long-term increase in the demand for currency and reserves.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a trend in the demand for currency and reserves without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing but rather provides context on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on long-term demand changes is more informational and does not directly indicate a stance on adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a review of monetary policy frameworks by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which is an activity related to assessing and potentially adjusting policy strategies. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to a process of evaluation and correlation between different central banks. This activity is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not in itself suggest a move towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a wait-and-see approach, emphasizing the importance of incoming data before deciding on any changes to the monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy without further evidence, reflecting a neutral position. The FOMC is expressing a readiness to adjust policy in response to new economic information, which is consistent with a data-dependent and flexible approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on discussing empirical evidence regarding the impact of asset price changes on consumption and investment, which does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a neutral, fact-finding approach that the FOMC might use to inform future policy decisions."
1,The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that strong investment is contributing to the growth of productive capacity, which in turn helps to contain inflationary pressures. This implies that the economy is robust enough to handle potential tightening measures without stoking inflation, as increased productive capacity can offset inflationary effects. Therefore, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, indicating that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating while maintaining stable prices."
0,Together these structural changes would imply that the economy can now operate at a lower unemployment rate and at a higher growth rate than previously without inflationary consequences.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the economy's structural changes have led to a new equilibrium where lower unemployment and higher growth do not necessarily lead to inflation. This indicates a shift in the economic understanding rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy but rather an observation that could inform future policy decisions."
2,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny"" suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring inflation trends with the implication that they are prepared to adjust policy to address inflationary pressures. This focus on inflation, especially if it is rising or expected to rise, typically indicates a willingness to tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. Tightening monetary policy, which can include raising interest rates, is considered a hawkish stance."
0,"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a correction in equity prices, which is expected to lead to a decrease in consumer spending, business fixed investment, and residential construction. This suggests that the FOMC might see a need to tighten monetary policy to prevent a potential overheating of the economy that could have led to the equity price correction. Tightening monetary policy in response to signs of economic exuberance or inflationary pressures aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation that does not directly indicate a current policy stance. It simply states a fact about past economic conditions and the Federal Reserve's actions during those times. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (which would be hawkish) nor an easing (which would be dovish) of monetary policy. The sentence does not provide information on the current or future direction of policy but rather reflects on the historical relationship between Fed tightening and recessions."
0,"And, of course, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate, at 13.3 percent, remains historically high.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights that, despite some improvements, the unemployment rate is still at a historically high level. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce measures to stimulate the economy and improve employment figures, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support maximum employment."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of predicting economic indicators and the potential discrepancies between policy targets and actual outcomes. This historical context does not advocate for a specific direction in current monetary policy but rather highlights the complexities the FOMC faces in setting policy."
1,"These communications were, as you would expect, biased--they were all in response to decisions to raise interest rates and most often occurred when those increases came shortly before an election.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical pattern of communication in response to interest rate increases, particularly around election times, but does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy action. It is more of a commentary on the timing and context of past communications rather than a clear signal of hawkish or dovish intent."
2,"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between stock prices and home sales, noting their correlation and the influence of interest rates on both. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how certain economic indicators might interact with each other, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stance."
2,"These productivity gains result from many forces, including business investment that has increased the amount and quality of capital available to the workforce, business process innovations, and the growth of innovative, research-intensive industries such as information technology and biotechnology.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors contributing to productivity gains, such as business investment, innovations, and the growth of certain industries, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions."
0,The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where a boom was driven by increased productivity and rising corporate profits, which in turn justified a rise in equity prices. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of past economic factors that influenced market conditions. This statement is more of an observation of economic dynamics rather than a signal of future monetary policy actions."
0,"Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement of fact regarding inflation levels in 1996 and does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reflects past economic conditions without suggesting any particular future actions by the FOMC."
2,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. policy rate changes in response to inflationary pressures have a significant impact on emerging market (EM) financial conditions. This suggests that the Federal Reserve is willing to adjust policy rates to manage inflation, which aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
2,Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Now I would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week's FOMC decision.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory statement that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the current economic situation and the recent FOMC decision, without indicating whether the policy stance is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
2,"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the P* model, which is a model used to predict inflation, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992 without judgmental adjustments. Deflation is a decrease in the general price level of goods and services, which is the opposite of inflation. A prediction of deflation implies that there is less pressure on prices to rise, and therefore, there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In this context, the stance is dovish because it indicates a situation where easing monetary policy might be appropriate to counteract the risks of deflation and support the FOMC's mandate of stable prices."
2,This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long-run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of understanding changes in the equilibrium real interest rate for effective policy setting but does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the need for informed decision-making based on current economic conditions relative to long-term levels, which is a fundamental aspect of the FOMC's approach to achieving its goals. The statement is more about the approach to policy rather than a specific policy stance."
2,"May 21, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the New York Association for Business Economics, New York, New York (via webcast) Share Accessible Keys for Video [Space Bar] toggles play/pause; [Right/Left Arrows] seeks the video forwards and back (5 sec ); [Up/Down Arrows] increase/decrease volume; [M] toggles mute on/off; [F] toggles fullscreen on/off (Except IE 11); The [Tab] key may be used in combination with the [Enter/Return] key to navigate and activate control buttons, such as caption on/off.","NEUTRAL

The provided sentence does not contain any information regarding the stance of monetary policy. Instead, it is a technical description of video control keys for accessibility during a webcast. It does not offer any insights into the FOMC's views on economic conditions, inflation, or employment, which are the factors that would influence their monetary policy stance."
2,"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural aspect of the forecasting process, emphasizing the need for consistency in economic outlooks, including various key economic variables. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a methodological approach to ensure coherent economic forecasts. This approach is part of the FOMC's broader strategy to make informed policy decisions that aim for maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a consideration for alternative measures to gauge inflationary pressures beyond the traditional indicator of excess demand. This indicates a willingness to explore different tools or indicators to understand inflation trends better, but it does not directly imply an immediate intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The focus is on the assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"There are a variety of versions of this basic approach, depending on measures of utilization and inflation rates and depending on whether the adjustment is made in response to past and current movements in utilization and inflation rates or in response to forecasts of these variables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes different methodologies for adjusting monetary policy based on various measures of resource utilization and inflation rates, as well as whether these adjustments are reactive to past and current data or proactive based on forecasts. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses the flexibility and considerations in policy formulation. This reflects the FOMC's balanced approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the potential pitfalls of aligning monetary policy too closely with market prices, which can be volatile and influenced by short-term factors. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of not being swayed by market whims. This suggests a commitment to a balanced approach that considers a range of indicators and factors beyond immediate market reactions."
2,"September 01, 2020 Bringing the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy into Alignment with Longer-Run Changes in the Economy Governor Lael Brainard At ""How the Fed Will Respond to the COVID-19 Recession in an Era of Low Rates and Low Inflation,"" an event hosted by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live I want to thank David Wessel for hosting this event.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply an introductory remark expressing gratitude to the event host and does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It does not indicate any specific actions or intentions regarding the tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it comment on the economic outlook, inflation, or employment, which are key factors in determining the FOMC's policy stance."
2,"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the modeling of the term structure of interest rates and how these models fit better when assuming changes in inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic modeling and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an understanding of how expectations and the central bank's perceived actions can influence economic models but does not commit to a specific policy direction."
2,"To summarize these international data, one might say that something brought inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s, but success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical observation about inflation trends in the 1980s and 1990s, noting that inflation decreased in both inflation-targeting and non-targeting countries. It does not indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in monetary policy. The sentence reflects a neutral analysis of past inflation data without advocating for tighter or looser monetary policy."
0,"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that an increase in productivity is having a disinflationary effect, which could be interpreted as reducing inflationary pressures without explicitly suggesting a need to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a shift towards a more balanced risk outlook, suggesting neither a clear move towards tightening nor easing of monetary policy. It acknowledges an improvement in domestic demand risks and a reduction in foreign risks, which could imply a stable economic environment that does not immediately warrant a change in monetary policy stance."
2,"Back then, the unemployment rate was 8.1percent and nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six months; today, those figures are 7.6 percent and 194,000, respectively.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is providing a factual comparison of economic indicators at two different points in time, specifically the unemployment rate and the rate of increase in nonfarm payrolls. It does not directly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's key concerns. The improvement in the unemployment rate and the increase in nonfarm payrolls could be interpreted as positive economic developments, but without additional context on the FOMC's reaction or policy implications, the stance remains neutral."
2,"January 13, 2021 Full Employment in the New Monetary Policy Framework Governor Lael Brainard At the Inaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment Sponsored by the Canadian Association for Business Economics (via webcast) Share I want to thank the Canadian Association for Business Economics for inviting me to join you today, particularly president Bonnie Lemcke and past president Armine Yalnizyan.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is simply an introductory statement where Governor Lael Brainard is expressing gratitude for being invited to speak at an event. It does not contain any information about the stance of monetary policy, such as indications of tightening or easing, nor does it discuss the economic outlook or the FOMC's policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it does not reflect a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy but is rather a formality at the beginning of a speech."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target temporarily. This approach suggests that the FOMC is focused on ensuring that inflation does not fall persistently below its desired level and that long-term inflation expectations remain stable. By tolerating higher inflation for some time, the FOMC is signaling that it may be less inclined to ease monetary policy further and more inclined to tighten it to prevent inflation from becoming unanchored. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the priority is to prevent high inflation rather than to stimulate the economy."
0,Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent.7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the current economic situation, particularly the high unemployment rate among the lowest-wage workers and the expectation that vaccinations will help revive demand for in-person services. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context for the economic conditions that the FOMC is monitoring. The mention of vaccinations leading to a potential increase in demand suggests an anticipation of economic improvement, but without a clear policy direction tied to this statement, it remains neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the flexibility of a central bank's approach to pursuing price stability in varying circumstances, contrasting it with a bank that has a strict numerical target. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the adaptability of policy frameworks. This adaptability is in line with the FOMC's commitment to adjusting policy as needed to manage economic fluctuations and achieve its long-term goals."
1,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that interest rates are increasing, which is typically a sign of tightening monetary policy. Higher interest rates can slow down inflation by making borrowing more expensive, which in turn can reduce spending and investment. The mention of prices rising less rapidly suggests an intention to control inflation, and the increase in debt-service obligations reflects the costlier environment for borrowers, both of which align with a hawkish stance aimed at stabilizing prices and managing inflation towards the target level."
2,What does this suggest about monetary policy strategy going forward?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""What does this suggest about monetary policy strategy going forward?"" is a question rather than a statement of policy stance. It does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy (tightening, easing, or maintaining current levels). Instead, it prompts for an analysis or consideration of implications for future monetary policy based on previous context or data. Without additional context, it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
2,"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle."" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It seems to be a general statement about the existence of consistent price measurements, which is a foundational concept for the FOMC's goal of price stability. The sentence does not provide information on current or future policy actions or the Committee's outlook on economic conditions such as inflation or employment. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"Given stable prices, savers and investors have more confidence about the ultimate value of their investments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of monetary policy, stating that stable prices contribute to confidence in the value of investments. It does not directly indicate a current or future action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects one of the goals of the FOMC—stable prices—which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance focused on maintaining economic stability rather than moving in a direction to either stimulate or cool down the economy."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for certain economic conditions to be met (sustained achievement of employment and inflation objectives) before raising interest rates (""liftoff""), combined with a tool to manage interest rates across different maturities (""yield curve caps""). This approach indicates a balanced stance that is neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but rather setting conditions for future actions based on the achievement of the FOMC's goals. It reflects a commitment to the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for immediate policy change."
2,Econometric methods were also refined to improve estimation and to accommodate more-complex dynamics in money demand equations.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses technical improvements in econometric methods related to money demand equations, which does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more about the tools used to analyze economic conditions rather than a statement about policy direction."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that with the economy nearing full employment, there is an increased likelihood of stronger inflation outcomes due to potential fiscal stimulus. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The mention of ""stronger inflation outcomes"" aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the anticipation of such outcomes may prompt the Committee to consider measures to counteract inflationary pressures."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of global factors on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as the improved resilience of the financial system due to better risk management and stronger regulation. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of the current economic and financial conditions. The mention of stronger financial institutions suggests a stable environment, which does not inherently call for an immediate monetary policy response. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not signal a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is procedural and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It simply states that there will be a presentation on policy alternatives, without giving any hint as to whether the policy will be tightened, eased, or remain the same."
0,"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that as price stability is achieved or deflation occurs, the resistance to nominal wage cuts could lead to higher real wages, which might result in a higher equilibrium level of unemployment. This implies a potential risk of deflationary pressures leading to economic underperformance, which could prompt the FOMC to consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent deflation and support employment, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to keeping inflation low, which often involves tightening monetary policy to prevent prices from rising too quickly. This stance aligns with the goal of stable prices and suggests that the FOMC may prioritize measures to control inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach."
0,"For instance, in countries where sovereign or corporate debt levels are high, higher interest rates could increase debt-servicing burdens and concerns about debt sustainability, which could be exacerbated by currency depreciation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential risk associated with higher interest rates in countries with high debt levels, which could lead to increased debt-servicing burdens and concerns about debt sustainability, potentially worsened by currency depreciation. This statement is an observation of economic conditions and potential consequences rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather acknowledges the complexities and potential risks in the global financial environment that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions."
2,"In these models, each asset price contains a risk premium that represents the additional return demanded by risk-averse investors for bearing risk.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a fundamental concept in financial economics regarding asset pricing and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It explains that asset prices include a risk premium, which is the extra return investors require for taking on risk. This statement does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides context on how financial markets function."
2,"Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance between underlying supply and demand is restored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic principle that spot prices tend to return to a long-term equilibrium as supply and demand balance out. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an understanding of market dynamics, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader analysis of the economy but does not in itself suggest a specific monetary policy action."
2,"Under pure monetary targeting, interest rates would fluctuate with shocks in spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical approach to monetary policy, stating that under a regime of pure monetary targeting, interest rates would naturally respond to changes in spending due to economic shocks. This statement does not indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing but rather explains a concept related to how monetary policy could be implemented. It does not provide information on the current or future direction of policy with respect to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the macroeconomic data has been stronger than expected, with a significant rebound in GDP growth. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures if the growth is above the sustainable rate. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. A strong GDP growth rate could reduce the need for an accommodative policy stance, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
2,The idea is that providing more information about the Committee's views of the economic outlook may allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to transparency and communication with the financial markets, rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It suggests that by sharing their economic outlook, the Committee aims to help the market better understand and anticipate future policy moves, which could be either tightening or easing, depending on the economic conditions. This statement is more about the method of communication rather than the content of the policy itself."
2,"Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancient Rome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a one percent interest rate nor 200 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about interest rates and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests imminent policy actions nor provides insight into the Committee's current policy decisions in relation to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"Monetary Policy But it is monetary policy--and the Fed's principal monetary lever, the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans of reserves between depository institutions--that earns the Federal Reserve all that ink and airtime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a descriptive statement explaining the role of monetary policy and the federal funds rate as the Federal Reserve's primary tool for influencing the economy. It does not indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather provides an overview of the mechanisms the Fed uses to achieve its goals."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand. This action aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy to address inflation risks is typically considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Conclusion To sum up, none of us, obviously, can see the future, and instead we shall have to monitor incoming data closely for evidence of any shifts in recent productivity trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a stance of vigilance and data-dependency, suggesting that the FOMC is open to adjusting policy in response to new economic information related to productivity trends, which could impact both employment and inflation. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators and balancing risks with long-term goals."
2,"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical data regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and its growth rate over a specific period. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a neutral observation of past wage growth trends without suggesting any immediate policy action."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a trend toward disinflation, which means a reduction in the rate of inflation, and it attributes this trend to a potentially large amount of economic slack, which refers to underused resources in the economy. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that aim to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other expansionary measures. In this context, the statement implies that there may be room for easing monetary policy to address the lack of demand and underutilization in the economy, aligning with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the methodology for understanding long-term interest rates and does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy. It explains that forward rates are influenced by expectations of future short-term rates and the compensation required for long-term risk, including inflation risk. This is more of a technical observation about market dynamics rather than a signal of policy intentions."
2,"Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of accurate forecasting for informed policy-making. Good forecasts are essential for the FOMC to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy direction."
