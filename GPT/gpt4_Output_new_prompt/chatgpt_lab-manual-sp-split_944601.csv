1,"Such second-round effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure 1).","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a rise in the relative price of energy, it is not expected to lead to an increase in long-run inflation expectations, suggesting that the current situation does not warrant a change in monetary policy stance. The statement is balanced, acknowledging a potential risk (higher energy prices) but also noting that this risk has not materialized into a broader inflationary concern, as long-term expectations remain stable. This reflects a wait-and-see approach, which is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
2,This aggregate growth-accounting framework forms the economic underpinning of key comprehensive productivity statistics produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a framework used for producing productivity statistics and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a factual statement about the methodology behind economic data without any clear implications for future monetary policy actions."
0,"Analysis suggests it could take many years with a formal AIT rule to return the price level to target following a lower-bound episode, and a mechanical AIT rule is likely to become increasingly difficult to explain and implement as conditions change over time.15 In contrast, FAIT is better suited for the highly uncertain and dynamic context in which policymaking takes place.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the effectiveness of different inflation targeting strategies (Average Inflation Targeting, AIT, and Flexible Average Inflation Targeting, FAIT) without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that while a formal AIT rule might be challenging to implement and communicate, especially in a dynamic economic environment, FAIT offers a more adaptable approach to policymaking. This reflects a focus on the FOMC's strategy and tools rather than an immediate policy stance change."
2,"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a general belief in the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in achieving noninflationary economic growth, without indicating a specific direction for future policy changes. It suggests that the policymaker values the role of these policies in reaching long-term goals, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and maximum employment. However, it does not provide information on whether there is a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral."
1,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence reflects a hawkish stance by acknowledging that past efforts to reduce inflation involved deliberately slowing down economic activity, which can be painful. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy, even at the cost of economic growth, to maintain price stability and preserve the credibility gained from low inflation rates. It implies that the FOMC values the control of inflation and is prepared to take measures that may slow economic activity if necessary to achieve this goal."
2,"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current monetary policy action is being justified by a forward-looking approach that takes into account the forecast of future output gaps and inflation. The Taylor Rule is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, specifically the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation. A forward-looking variant implies that the policy is being adjusted in anticipation of future economic conditions rather than solely in response to current conditions. If the policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation, it indicates a proactive stance to prevent overheating of the economy or rising inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been growing above trend for three years, which has substantially reduced economic slack. This implies that the economy might be operating near or at its full capacity, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In addition, some of the correlation may reflect the effect of the response of monetary policy to exchange rate developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between monetary policy responses and exchange rate developments without indicating a clear direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It suggests that the FOMC is aware of the impact of exchange rates on the economy and is considering this in their policy decisions, but it does not provide information on whether they are inclined to move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The focus is on the interaction between policy and exchange rates rather than a commitment to adjust the policy in a specific direction."
2,"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical observation rather than a current policy stance or future policy direction. It simply states a fact about the economic conditions of 1996, noting the simultaneous occurrence of low unemployment and inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not provide information on whether the FOMC would act to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it indicate a clear direction for future policy moves."
2,"LBOs, and other forms of private equity investment, may force management to implement strategic changes rapidly to restore the firmâ€™s return on equity and boost share prices, in part by increasing financial leverage.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and private equity investment on firm management strategies, including the use of financial leverage to improve return on equity and share prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it describes a market phenomenon related to corporate finance and investment behavior, which is not directly related to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining a low federal funds rate until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy (i.e., raise interest rates) until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a return to the 2% inflation target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed 2% for some time. This dovish stance is supportive of economic growth and employment, and it shows a tolerance for inflation to run slightly higher than the target before considering tightening measures."
2,"At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that future monetary policy decisions will be data-dependent, particularly concerning inflation outlook. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather conveys a stance of waiting for more information before deciding on the next steps. This approach aligns with the FOMC's principle of being responsive to economic indicators and adjusting policy as necessary to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"As the economy approached full employment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve System, was faced with the classic problem of managing the mid-cycle slowdown--that is, of setting policy to help guide the economy toward sustainable growth without inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is focused on managing sustainable growth without inflation as the economy approaches full employment. This suggests a concern for preventing overheating in the economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In this context, ""managing the mid-cycle slowdown"" implies that the FOMC might lean towards tightening monetary policy to avoid inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding the current account deficit and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It explains the cause of the growing current account deficit as a surge in U.S. investment and productivity, along with capital inflows attracted by higher U.S. rates of return. This statement is more about the economic conditions and the effects of previous policy decisions rather than a signal of future policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a research finding on the relationship between U.S. short-term interest rates and euro area bond yields, rather than directly indicating a stance on the future direction of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent action to tighten or ease monetary policy by the FOMC. Instead, it acknowledges the interconnectedness of global financial markets and the potential impact of U.S. monetary policy on other economies. This understanding can inform the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy change."
0,"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on preventing the economy from growing so rapidly that it would lead to increased inflation. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to keep inflation in check, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The mention of influencing the economy to ""make full use of available resources"" also implies a careful balance to avoid underutilization, but the emphasis on preventing inflation is a key characteristic of a hawkish policy approach."
2,"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential economic imbalances that could worsen during a boom and lead to negative outcomes like rising inflation and higher interest rates, followed by a recession. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent an unsustainable boom and the associated risks, aligning with the goal of maintaining stable prices and moderating long-term interest rates. The focus on preventing higher inflation and the adverse effects of an economic downturn indicates a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
2,"Other economies, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the exchange rate policies of other economies and does not directly indicate the Federal Reserve's stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to adjust interest rates nor provides insight into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or monetary policy adjustments. Therefore, it does not reflect a hawkish or dovish stance but rather provides context on international monetary mechanisms."
1,"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of globalization on central banking culture, particularly the emphasis on the importance of price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the shared values among central banks worldwide. The focus on price stability aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, but the sentence does not provide specific information on policy direction."
1,"in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a loss of credibility for the Federal Reserve (the Fed) leads to a higher cost of reducing inflation, suggesting that maintaining credibility is likely to involve a commitment to tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the central bank is focused on preventing high inflation even if it means potentially slowing down the economy."
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target for some time following periods when it has been below that level. This suggests that the FOMC is prepared to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which is a stance typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from escalating too far above the target. The focus on anchoring expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability implies a commitment to taking action to ensure inflation does not deviate significantly from the target, which can be seen as a hawkish approach to prevent long-term inflationary pressures."
2,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's actions to tighten monetary policy, typically by raising interest rates, have historically led to recessions as a consequence of trying to control inflation. This suggests a stance that prioritizes combating inflation even at the risk of economic contraction, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. Hawkish policies are generally associated with concerns about high inflation and the actions taken to curb it, even if those actions may slow down economic growth."
2,"Lessons from Past Productivity Booms First, many of the technological innovations associated with past productivity booms were general purpose technologies (GPTs) with widespread applicability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about the nature of technological innovations during past productivity booms and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on the factors that can influence productivity and, indirectly, the broader economy."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support growth and employment when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that adjusting the federal funds rate by an additional 50 or 100 basis points would not significantly impact investor beliefs regarding the profitability of emerging technologies. This indicates a view that monetary policy has limited influence on certain aspects of market behavior, particularly long-run earnings growth expectations driven by factors other than monetary policy. The statement neither explicitly advocates for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather comments on the perceived effectiveness of such actions in a specific context."
2,maintaining low and stable inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""maintaining low and stable inflation"" indicates a commitment to preventing high inflation, which typically aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on controlling inflation, often through higher interest rates or other contractionary measures."
0,Domestic demand growth has slumped in many foreign economies because of varying combinations of an increase in saving rates and a decline in investment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding foreign economies, noting a decrease in domestic demand growth due to higher saving rates and lower investment. This statement does not directly indicate a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, as it neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of policy. It is simply an assessment of economic conditions abroad, which may be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States."
2,"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical or empirical relationship between inflation and various economic factors, including lagged inflation, resource utilization, and the relative price of certain imports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it outlines some of the variables that might influence inflation, which is a key concern for the FOMC. The sentence is analytical in nature and does not suggest any particular policy action."
2,"According to the Taylor Rule, the federal funds rate should adjust over time to changes in utilization rates (the gap between actual and potential output or between the unemployment rate and NAIRU) and to changes in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a principle of monetary policy adjustment based on the Taylor Rule, which is a guideline for how the federal funds rate should respond to changes in economic conditions, specifically the output gap and inflation. It does not indicate a current policy stance but rather explains a method for determining appropriate adjustments to maintain stable prices and maximum employment. The Taylor Rule suggests a systematic response to economic indicators, which could lead to either tightening or easing depending on the specific circumstances, thus the sentence itself is neutral."
1,"Maintaining low inflation rates reduces the levels of future uncertainties and, hence, increases the scope of investment opportunities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of monetary policy, stating that low inflation rates can lead to a reduction in uncertainty and an increase in investment opportunities. It does not directly indicate an immediate action or change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather explains a benefit of achieving stable prices, which is one of the FOMC's goals. The sentence does not provide specific guidance on the current stance of monetary policy or future actions."
0,"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges improvements in the labor market but also points out ongoing challenges with labor shortages, which can have a constraining effect on hiring and economic growth. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes current economic conditions related to employment. It reflects the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment but does not directly suggest any imminent policy action to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation."
2,not to target asset prices (or exchange rates).,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""not to target asset prices (or exchange rates)"" indicates a stance of not actively seeking to influence or control the levels of asset prices or exchange rates through monetary policy. This suggests a balanced approach that neither explicitly tightens nor eases monetary policy with the specific aim of affecting these financial variables. It reflects a principle of allowing market forces to determine asset prices and exchange rates, while the FOMC focuses on its broader mandates of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the central bank would need to create expectations of inflation to lower the real interest rate when nominal rates are at or near zero. This suggests a willingness to tolerate or even induce higher inflation, which is typically counteracted by a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability. Therefore, the stance leans towards being hawkish, as it indicates a potential move towards policies that could lead to higher inflation expectations, which the central bank may need to address through tightening measures."
2,"Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity"" is a statement of economic principle rather than a direct indication of current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the relationship between labor compensation and productivity, which is relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself signal a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the nature of oil price increases and their potential duration, relating to the source of demand growth. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's future decisions. The sentence suggests that if the demand causing oil price increases is domestic, the effect might be temporary, which would not necessarily warrant a change in monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of the situation rather than a commitment to action."
2,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" if the unemployment rate declines to the projected 3.8 percent. This suggests that the labor market is approaching a state that does not warrant further easing of monetary policy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, reaching maximum employment could lead to considerations of tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,* * * What then are the implications of this largely irreducible uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about how uncertainty affects the conduct of monetary policy, without providing a clear direction towards tightening or easing. It reflects an acknowledgment of the complexities in decision-making due to uncertainty but does not indicate a specific policy stance. The sentence suggests a contemplative and balanced approach, considering the unpredictable nature of economic factors and their impact on achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's consideration of international economic conditions and their effects on the U.S. economy, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of the interconnectedness of global economies and the potential impacts on the U.S. but does not suggest an imminent policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
0,Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by mid-2003.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical assessment of the achievement of price stability, which is one of the FOMC's goals. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides a retrospective statement on the status of their goal at a specific point in time. The sentence does not suggest any future policy actions or changes in stance."
2,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the monetary policy was in line with the Taylor Rule, which is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, but it also states that the nominal federal funds rate remained about unchanged. This suggests a balance between adjusting policy in response to economic indicators and maintaining a steady interest rate, which does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Conclusion To sum up, none of us, obviously, can see the future, and instead we shall have to monitor incoming data closely for evidence of any shifts in recent productivity trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a stance of vigilance and data-dependency, suggesting that the FOMC is open to adjusting policy as new information on productivity trends becomes available. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the efficiency of financial markets in response to the availability of complete information, which is a general principle of market operation and does not reflect a specific monetary policy action or intent. It neither suggests a move towards raising nor lowering interest rates, nor does it comment on the FOMC's primary goals of employment and inflation."
2,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) approach to transparency and communication regarding its daily operations and policy decisions, particularly the setting of short-term interest rates. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the FOMC's commitment to clear communication with the public and market participants. This approach is intended to avoid reliance on third-party interpretations and ensure that the FOMC's actions are understood directly from the source, which aligns with their goal of transparency but does not provide specific information on the direction of policy."
1,"In particular, the Committee noted that it would respond as necessary to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining price stability, which often involves tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This suggests a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes the control of inflation, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"Moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the Great Depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.","DOVISH

The sentence reflects a dovish stance because it indicates a concern for inflation levels falling too low, which could lead to deflationary pressures that are typically combated with easier monetary policy. The FOMC's reference to avoiding a ""substantial decline in inflation"" suggests a willingness to take action to prevent deflation and support economic activity and employment, aligning with the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing the Vice Chair's intent to discuss the relationship between financial markets and monetary policy, and how he interprets various economic signals. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather focuses on the analytical approach to understanding economic data and its implications for policy decisions. This is a preparatory remark for a broader discussion and does not commit to any specific monetary policy action."
2,"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to a presentation made by two economists regarding stock market valuation, using dividend-price ratios and related measures. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. It is merely a statement of fact about a past event and does not reflect on the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates."
2,And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a general observation about the time lag between policy changes and their effects on inflation, without suggesting a specific direction for future monetary policy. It reflects an understanding of the complexity of monetary policy effects on the economy but does not signal an immediate intent to tighten or ease monetary policy."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that a specific increase (presumably in some cost or price level) might lead to higher core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by raising inflation expectations. This concern about potential inflationary pressures suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to combat rising inflation and align with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
1,Estimates by the staff of the Federal Reserve indicate that about 40 percent of the growth in outstanding home mortgage debt during the past five years originated as financing the extraction of home equity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of past mortgage debt growth related to home equity extraction but does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance regarding tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact about historical financial activity rather than a signal of the FOMC's intentions to adjust monetary policy to influence employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the nature of policymaking as a complex and uncertain process. It does not indicate a stance towards achieving the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any particular action regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for financial markets to develop tools and methods to more accurately detect changes in the general price level. This statement is more about the capabilities of financial markets to assess economic conditions rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's current stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"As a policymaker, I can assure you that any model of inflation that did not take account of these effects, and how they might or might not affect ongoing rates of inflation, would have been of little practical use to the FOMC over the past few years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a perspective on the importance of considering various effects in models of inflation for practical use in FOMC decision-making. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the complexity of factors influencing inflation and the need for careful analysis. This suggests a balanced approach to policy formulation, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of the Federal Reserve's credibility, which has been established through a history of maintaining low inflation, and how it contributes to the effectiveness of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather underscores the value of the Fed's reputation in achieving its long-term goals. The statement reflects a general principle rather than a specific policy stance."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant decrease in core consumer price inflation (CPI), which suggests that inflationary pressures are diminishing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflation rate is moving away from the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. In response to lower inflation, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent deflationary risks, aligning with its mandate of stable prices."
2,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing inflation, which suggests that the actions taken (likely tightening measures) have been successful in managing inflation dynamics. This could be interpreted as a justification for maintaining or possibly even continuing a tighter monetary policy stance to ensure that inflation remains stable, aligning with the FOMC's goal of price stability."
1,Another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding non-industrialized nations and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the impact of oil prices on the current-account balance of these nations, which is a factor outside the direct influence of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such external factors when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,What policy options exist to deal with the U.S. current account deficit?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about policy options to address the U.S. current account deficit, which is a broader economic issue and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the FOMC's position regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools that would influence employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it does not clearly suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the risk of future inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to mitigate this risk. By mentioning term premiums to compensate for the risk of future inflation, it indicates an awareness of the potential for rising inflation, which is typically countered by a hawkish stance, such as raising interest rates. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,My impression is that most investors agree that the change is an improvement in openness and transparency of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general sentiment about the perceived improvement in the communication of monetary policy, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to transparency. It does not provide information on the direction of policy actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the potential effects of globalization on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects a neutral stance as it is more about understanding the broader economic context in which monetary policy operates rather than signaling a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential approach to managing inflation (""flexible inflation averaging"") and suggests it could be beneficial and easier to communicate compared to a formal average inflation targeting rule. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it discusses a method of inflation management, which could be used in various contexts, either when the policy is more hawkish or dovish, depending on the economic circumstances. The focus here is on the strategy for achieving the inflation target rather than on immediate policy adjustments."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a trade-off for achieving price stability. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, even at the cost of potentially negative impacts on employment and growth, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
0,"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the potential broad economic impacts of monetary policy actions targeted at a specific sector, suggesting a cautious approach. It does not directly imply an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of policy decisions and their wide-ranging effects. This reflects a balanced stance, weighing the risks of policy actions against their intended outcomes in the context of the FOMC's broader goals."
1,"Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between various interest rates and asset prices and their effects on the cost of borrowing and aggregate demand. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the mechanics of how changes in rates can influence economic activity. This is a statement of economic observation rather than a policy direction."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of predicting economic indicators and the potential discrepancies between targets and actual outcomes. This historical context does not advocate for a specific monetary policy direction in the present."
2,"Monetary Policy But it is monetary policy--and the Fed's principal monetary lever, the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans of reserves between depository institutions--that earns the Federal Reserve all that ink and airtime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a descriptive statement explaining the role of monetary policy and the federal funds rate as the Federal Reserve's primary tool for influencing the economy. It does not indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather provides information on the mechanism the Fed uses to implement its monetary policy."
0,Together these structural changes would imply that the economy can now operate at a lower unemployment rate and at a higher growth rate than previously without inflationary consequences.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a reassessment of the economic conditions that can be sustained without leading to inflation, indicating a change in the understanding of the relationship between unemployment, growth, and inflation. It does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation that could inform future policy decisions. The statement reflects a balanced view that the economy might be able to handle lower unemployment and higher growth without necessarily triggering inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"For example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to factories after the Civil War led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to operate the new machines.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical shift in the labor market demand due to changes in manufacturing production methods. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on how economic structures can change over time, which may be relevant to understanding long-term trends but does not offer insight into immediate monetary policy actions."
2,The idea is that providing more information about the Committee's views of the economic outlook may allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to transparency and communication with the financial markets, rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It suggests that by sharing their economic outlook, the Committee aims to help the market better understand and anticipate future policy moves, which could be either tightening or easing, depending on the economic conditions. This statement is about the process of communication rather than the content of the policy itself."
2,But I have seen little direct evidence on the extent to which globalization may have boosted aggregate productivity growth in the United States in recent years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a neutral observation regarding the impact of globalization on aggregate productivity growth in the United States, without suggesting any immediate implications for monetary policy adjustments. The focus on evidence of globalization's effect does not inherently signal a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"More recently, with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that while inflation is currently under control, there are signs of overheating in the financial markets, which is often associated with financial excesses. This implies a concern for potential inflationary pressures arising from financial imbalances, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain stable prices, one of their key objectives. Tightening monetary policy in response to financial excesses is a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent future inflation and maintain stability in the financial system."
1,"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been expanding at a good pace, which implies that there is not much slack (unused capacity) in the economy at the moment. This lack of slack could lead to inflationary pressures, indicating a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to slow down the pace of economic expansion to maintain stable prices, aligning with their goal of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker expects a gradual recovery of economic activity and the labor market, with growth and a decline in unemployment starting in the second half of the year. This implies that there is no immediate concern for overheating or inflation pressures that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Instead, the focus is on supporting the economy's recovery, which aligns with a dovish stance that typically favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity and employment."
2,"At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of observation and analysis used to inform monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy tightening or easing but rather reflects a balanced approach to understanding economic conditions and shaping future policy. The focus is on being data-driven and adaptable, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?"" does not provide any clear indication of a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It seems to be the introduction to a discussion or analysis rather than a statement of policy stance. The sentence could be leading into an explanation of economic conditions that might inform the FOMC's decisions, but without further context, it does not suggest a move to raise or lower interest rates or to otherwise adjust monetary policy. It is neutral as it does not directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an economic rationale for the development of cities, focusing on the concept of labor market pooling and its impact on productivity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how specific labor market conditions can affect productivity, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader economic analysis. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action regarding monetary policy adjustments."
1,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of the inflation averaging strategy without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states that the policy does not specify the acceptable bounds for inflation above the 2% target or the duration for which higher inflation levels might be considered acceptable. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not suggest any immediate action to either raise or lower interest rates but rather points to a feature of the policy framework."
1,"A European Central Bank analysis concluded that the release of capital buffers increased headroom for banks relative to not only their regulatory thresholds, but also their internal risk controls, and enabled banks to continue providing credit to households and businesses.6 And of course, monetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment, which suggests that the monetary policy is oriented towards tightening measures to combat inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a priority on controlling inflation, potentially through increasing interest rates or other contractionary monetary policies."
1,Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment"" reflects a core principle of the Federal Reserve's mandate but does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing. It emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for a healthy employment environment, which is a long-term goal of the Fed. This statement is consistent with the Fed's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not provide specific guidance on immediate policy actions or adjustments."
1,"With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal that we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis point hike would help do that.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tightening of monetary policy. The reference to the economy being at full employment and inflation being far above target suggests that the FOMC sees overheating in the economy, which typically leads to a hawkish stance. The mention of moving back to neutral ""at a fast pace"" and specifically a ""50-basis point hike"" in interest rates is a clear signal of intent to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with the goal of price stability."
2,success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation that the outcomes (presumably related to economic goals such as inflation control) were similar regardless of whether countries were explicitly targeting inflation. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance but rather comments on the effectiveness of different monetary policy frameworks in achieving stability."
1,Theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that an increase in the rate of return on capital, due to a rise in the growth rate of technical change, would necessitate higher real market interest rates. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as higher interest rates are typically used to manage inflation and ensure stable prices, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a methodological approach to analyzing the impact of FOMC policy decisions on financial markets, rather than indicating a direction of policy change. It explains how the Committee assesses the immediate effects of its announcements on financial markets to isolate the impact of its policy decisions from other economic news. This approach is part of the FOMC's transparency and does not directly suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,Such departures of expectations from perfect rationality can be an important source of observed inflation dynamics.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of expectations that deviate from perfect rationality in influencing inflation dynamics. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather acknowledges a factor that affects inflation. This statement is more about the understanding of inflation behavior than a direct indication of policy action."
2,"King (1999) shows that, if a long enough interval is given to hit the target, there may be little difference between a price level target and an inflation rate target.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the theoretical implications of different monetary policy targets (price level vs. inflation rate) over a long interval, rather than indicating a current stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing but rather provides an analysis of policy frameworks."
0,"Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the factors contributing to productivity growth in the United States, namely an investment boom and a technological revolution. It does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it does not suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments and is classified as neutral."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are current imbalances in the economy, including in the labor supply, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without causing persistent inflationary pressure. This indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of the economy and does not signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but does not see the imbalances as a long-term threat to their inflation or employment goals."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for efficient resource allocation and achieving maximum sustainable employment. This suggests a focus on controlling inflation, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent an overheated economy. The statement aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a willingness to prioritize inflation control, potentially through higher interest rates or other contractionary measures, to maintain long-term economic health."
0,"For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is not yet ready to reduce its asset purchases, suggesting that it is waiting for more significant progress towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This implies a continuation of an accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, which is consistent with a dovish approach. The use of ""substantial further progress"" suggests that the Committee is looking for more evidence of improvement before considering tightening monetary policy through the reduction of asset purchases."
1,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that strong productivity growth allows for higher real interest rates without hampering economic growth. Higher real interest rates typically indicate a tightening of monetary policy, as they can be the result of increased nominal rates or a targeted approach to control inflation. The statement suggests that the economy can withstand higher interest rates due to productivity gains, which aligns with a hawkish stance that supports raising rates to maintain price stability while not adversely affecting employment or long-term growth rates."
1,"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is considering tightening monetary policy, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. The reference to ""a more firmly established economic recovery"" suggests that the conditions for tightening are becoming more favorable, and the expectation is that the negative impacts on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) will be offset by the positive effects of increased demand from a stronger US economy. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation and maintaining economic stability, even if it means potentially slowing down economic growth."
1,"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to preventing inflation, which could undermine economic expansion and efficiency. The focus on achieving price stability suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to control inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes low inflation over other economic goals."
0,"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an update on the labor market, indicating a significant recovery of jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather reports on the progress towards the goal of maximum employment. The statement is factual and does not imply a clear direction for future policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Price and capital controls, which might have been feasible a half century ago, would be very difficult to implement in today's more technologically advanced environment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy in terms of tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the feasibility of certain economic interventions, such as price and capital controls, in the context of technological advancements. It does not provide information on the FOMC's current policy actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, focusing on the deficit and factors that affect it. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it acknowledges that various nonmonetary factors can influence the budget deficit, which is separate from the FOMC's direct tools such as interest rate adjustments. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's actions or intentions regarding maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates, which are the primary goals of the FOMC's monetary policy."
1,"Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of inflation on different income groups, particularly highlighting the challenges faced by lower- and moderate-income individuals. It does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather acknowledges the social and economic effects of inflation. This understanding of inflation's impact is part of the broader context in which the FOMC operates, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy direction."
2,"A more-timely data source, average hourly earnings, decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter, down from 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a slight deceleration in the growth rate of average hourly earnings, which is an indicator of wage trends and potential inflationary pressures. However, the change is minor (from 4.6% to 4.4%), and the sentence does not explicitly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy. It merely reports on wage growth data, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might view this as within the range of normal fluctuation and not necessarily a trigger for policy adjustment."
2,"The role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context about the organizational structure of the Federal Reserve System, emphasizing the balance between centralized and regional roles. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather sets the stage for a discussion on policy formulation. The mention of the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression serves to highlight the evolution of the Federal Reserve's structure rather than its current monetary policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"However, in this framework, the current period appears to be an outlier.4 That is, even after factoring in the current-cycle dynamics of strong profit growth and relatively modest investment, a good part of the rise in liquid assets remains unaccounted for--as much as one half of the total rise in cash-to-assets--according to Federal Reserve staff estimates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an observation regarding the rise in liquid assets that remains unexplained even after considering current economic dynamics. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of financial conditions that could be relevant for future policy decisions. The mention of ""strong profit growth and relatively modest investment"" alongside the unaccounted rise in liquid assets does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions. It is more of a statement of economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in its policy deliberations."
0,"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the prices of exports and the balance of trade, which is influenced by foreign exchange markets. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation on international trade dynamics, which could be a factor the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. However, without a clear link to policy actions or intentions, the sentence remains neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation rates being persistently below the FOMC's 2% target, which could lead to lower long-term inflation expectations. The mention of ""makeup"" strategies suggests that there is a consideration for policies that would allow inflation to rise above the target for some time to compensate for previous periods of below-target inflation. This implies a potential easing of monetary policy to boost inflation to the desired level, which is a dovish stance."
2,"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical data regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and its growth rate over a specific period. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a factual account of past ECI performance, which is a measure of wage inflation, without suggesting any particular policy action."
2,"Once this process is completed, however, we might expect consumer price inflation to move into better alignment with long-run expectations and thus settle in around 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests an expectation that inflation will stabilize around the FOMC's target rate of 2 percent in the long run, which implies neither an immediate tightening nor easing of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view that the current policy measures are expected to align with the long-term goals of stable prices without indicating a need for a policy shift in either direction."
1,"The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public's expectations of inflation will also be low and stable.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of monetary policy, stating that price stability leads to stable inflation expectations, which in turn promotes stability in output and employment. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the rationale behind aiming for price stability as part of the FOMC's mandate. The focus is on the benefits of controlling inflation for achieving the broader economic goals of the Federal Reserve, without suggesting any immediate policy action."
2,"In that regard, the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges that changes in the macroeconomic environment will be considered during the monetary policy review, which could have implications for financial stability. This suggests a balanced approach, weighing the impact of economic changes on financial stability without committing to a specific policy action."
1,Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of inflation targeting, specifically its association with improved communication and transparency to make the central bank's policy intentions clearer. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a methodological approach to policy implementation. The focus on communication and transparency is a general principle that can support any monetary policy stance by making it more effective, whether the policy is hawkish, dovish, or neutral."
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the neutral level of the federal funds rate is lower than in the past, which suggests that the rate is closer to its effective lower bound (ELB). This proximity to the ELB implies that there is less room for the FOMC to lower rates in response to economic downturns, which could lead to downside risks for inflation and employment. Acknowledging these risks suggests a tendency towards a more accommodative policy stance to support employment and prevent inflation from falling below the target, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy stance."
2,This was a key reason why currency crises of the past few decades were so costly: Sharp depreciations of the exchange rate boosted the domestic-currency value of foreign debt and wreaked havoc with government finances and corporate balance sheets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the impact of currency crises on economies, specifically mentioning the negative effects of sharp depreciations in exchange rates on government finances and corporate balance sheets. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide insight into the FOMC's future policy actions. Instead, it reflects on the consequences of past events without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy."
2,"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of price indexes when making policy decisions. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather cautions against potential errors in policy formulation due to imperfect data. This reflects a balanced approach, focusing on the accuracy of the information used to guide policy decisions in line with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and informed decision-making."
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the recent spike in inflation is temporary and not widespread across the economy. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as it is expected to subside on its own. This stance aligns with a dovish approach, which is generally more accommodative and less concerned with fighting inflation through raising interest rates."
2,"I have downplayed the role of the U.S. federal budget deficit today, and I disagree with the view, sometimes heard, that balancing the federal budget by itself would largely defuse the current account issue.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the speaker's view regarding the relationship between the U.S. federal budget deficit and the current account issue, rather than directly addressing monetary policy actions such as interest rate adjustments or other measures that the Federal Reserve might take to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The statement neither implies a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather discusses fiscal policy, which is outside the direct purview of the FOMC's monetary policy tools."
2,"To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical approach to understanding changes in the term premium, which is a component of interest rates, by referring to research literature. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy actions such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an analytical perspective on economic conditions, which is a neutral activity in the context of policy stance."
2,"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of the challenges faced by monetary policymakers in emerging economies, which does not directly indicate a stance on the FOMC's monetary policy in the United States. It is a general statement about the global economic environment rather than a comment on the FOMC's policy intentions or actions."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to adjust interest rates rapidly in response to changing economic conditions. This implies a proactive stance on monetary policy, which could include tightening (raising rates) if economic indicators show signs of overheating, such as high inflation or an overheated labor market. The readiness to change rates quickly is typically associated with a hawkish approach, as it indicates vigilance against inflationary pressures and a commitment to the goal of stable prices."
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technological advancement in terms of the cost of computing power, which is not directly related to the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It neither indicates a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the price trend of a specific sector, which could have various implications for the broader economy."
2,also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC is taking actions to prevent potential future increases in inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. This proactive approach to managing inflation expectations is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
0,"There was also a sharp acceleration in productivity over 1997, which held down unit labor costs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where an increase in productivity led to lower unit labor costs, without directly suggesting a need for a change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on economic conditions that could influence their decisions. The impact on employment and inflation is not directly stated, so the stance is neutral regarding policy direction."
1,"However, we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in 1973.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about productivity growth and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects on past economic conditions without suggesting a particular direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
0,"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the expectations of real short-term interest rates without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It reflects a change in long-term projections rather than an immediate policy stance."
2,The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a practice of gathering information and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that the presidents' reports include anecdotal evidence to inform the FOMC about current economic conditions in different regions. This practice is part of the Committee's information-gathering process and does not in itself suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the influences on the short end of the yield curve, without indicating a specific direction for future monetary policy. It acknowledges that monetary policy and cyclical factors are key drivers of short-term interest rates but does not suggest whether the FOMC is inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, it does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Among other questions that could be addressed would be how policy actions (as opposed to inflation outcomes) influence expectations and how sensitive Federal Reserve credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is exploring theoretical questions about the impact of policy actions on expectations and the Federal Reserve's credibility in relation to inflation targets. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather discusses the considerations that might affect future policy decisions. The focus on understanding the dynamics of policy actions and credibility suggests a balanced approach to managing inflation and employment objectives."
2,"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of policymakers updating their estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the output gap, which are key indicators for assessing economic conditions and setting monetary policy. However, it does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a balanced approach to policy-making, where decisions are data-driven and adapt to new economic information. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on a range of indicators."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a trend toward disinflation, which means a reduction in the rate of inflation, and it attributes this trend to a potentially large amount of economic slack, which refers to underused resources in the economy. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that aim to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other expansionary measures. In this context, the mention of disinflation and economic slack implies that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates, as the primary concern appears to be to encourage economic activity and prevent deflation, rather than to combat high inflation. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, and in the face of disinflation, a dovish policy stance would be more likely to support this objective."
0,These geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that geopolitical events are expected to have a negative impact on economic growth. When growth is at risk, the FOMC may lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to support the economy, which is consistent with a dovish approach. This implies that the FOMC might consider measures to stimulate growth in the face of these downside risks, rather than focusing on tightening policy."
2,"Central bank actions are designed in the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and thus the evolution of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism by which central bank actions, such as those by the Federal Reserve, influence the economy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general statement on how monetary policy operates by affecting asset prices and yields, which then impact economic decisions and outcomes. This reflects an understanding of the FOMC's principles and the transmission of monetary policy but does not signal a specific policy stance."
0,"When the government runs deficits, it siphons off private savings (reducing national saving), leaving less available for capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a fiscal policy outcome where government deficits are funded by private savings, potentially reducing the amount available for capital investment. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of an observation on the relationship between government deficits and national saving, rather than a comment on the current or future stance of monetary policy in relation to the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to a ""flexible form of average inflation targeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the Federal Reserve's approach to managing inflation, moving from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to a ""flexible form of average inflation targeting."" This statement does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a methodological change in how the FOMC aims to achieve its long-term inflation goal. The new framework allows for inflation to be above 2% for some time to balance periods when it has been below that target, suggesting a more balanced approach to managing inflation over time."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are currently significant imbalances in the economy, including in the labor market, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without leading to persistent inflationary pressures. This indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of the economy and does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but does not currently see the imbalances as a trigger for a change in policy."
0,"Though widely anticipated even before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse course.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there was a recession and a decrease in employment, which led to pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse its previous course of action, likely implying a move towards easing monetary policy to support economic growth and employment. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is characterized by policies that are aimed at stimulating the economy, often through lower interest rates or other measures that increase liquidity."
2,"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the history of the European Central Bank (ECB) and does not provide any indication of the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy, nor does it offer insight into the current economic conditions or the FOMC's policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of balanced-budget requirements at the state level, which is a fiscal policy matter rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an example of how deficit targets can be implemented in fiscal contexts. This does not directly relate to the FOMC's monetary policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil have already begun tightening their monetary policy by increasing interest rates in response to expectations of accelerating inflation. Tightening monetary policy, which often involves raising interest rates, is a measure taken to control inflation and is thus considered a hawkish stance. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the action described is a direct response to inflationary concerns, which is characteristic of a hawkish policy approach."
2,"My goal is not to draw conclusions on recent movements in risk premiums but rather to give you a sense of how estimates of risk premiums may influence our policy decisionmaking, to note some of the difficulties that we face in interpreting their movements, and, I hope, to stimulate further research in this already fertile field.1 At the Federal Reserve, we pay a lot of attention to financial market prices in the formulation of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the consideration of risk premiums in policy decision-making and acknowledges the challenges in interpreting financial market movements. This reflects a balanced approach to incorporating financial indicators into policy decisions without suggesting a specific policy action."
0,"Less uncertainty about future inflation could lower the risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds, lowering the risk-free interest rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential outcome of reduced uncertainty about future inflation, which could lead to lower risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds and thus a lower risk-free interest rate. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses a possible effect on interest rates based on market perceptions of inflation risk. It reflects an understanding of how expectations can influence financial conditions, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of monitoring a range of indicators and balancing risks."
0,Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent.7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the current economic situation, particularly focusing on the high unemployment rate among the lowest-wage workers and the expectation that vaccinations will help revive the sectors that employ them. It does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on employment conditions, which is one of the FOMC's goals, without suggesting a specific policy response."
2,"Despite the prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4 In contrast, as noted, study of the role of committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5 Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to policymaking.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the academic attention given to the study of monetary policy formulation, contrasting the focus on monetary policy rules with the study of the role of committees in policy-making. It does not directly indicate a stance on the direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions or the FOMC's intentions regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Instead, it is a commentary on the historical and academic perspectives on policy formulation methods."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations as a principle of successful monetary policy, without indicating a current direction for policy adjustment. It emphasizes the role of expectations in achieving stability but does not suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes strong demand and a very tight labor market as contributing factors to inflation pressures. The mention of removing ""extraordinary monetary policy accommodation"" suggests that the FOMC is considering tightening monetary policy to address these inflationary concerns. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy and bring inflation back towards the target level."
2,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, particularly concerning inflation and employment, as the world economy reopens. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity and unpredictability of the current economic environment. The FOMC is signaling that it is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to adjust policy in response to evolving conditions, but it does not commit to a specific direction of policy change."
1,"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a modest increase in inflation, but it also acknowledges that this is from a very low rate, suggesting that the inflation level is not far from the target. This does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as the situation is not extreme in either direction."
2,"Labor force participation isn't growing as much as one would expect with the hot job market, but apparently it's growing enough to keep the job creation machine humming.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while labor force participation is not increasing as much as expected given the strong job market, it is still sufficient to support ongoing job creation. This suggests a balanced view of the labor market, without a clear indication of whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement acknowledges a positive aspect of the labor market (job creation) alongside a less-than-ideal condition (suboptimal growth in labor force participation), which does not clearly advocate for a change in policy stance."
2,"To be clear, when I say ""risk premium"" I mean the additional compensation required by investors for holding a risky security--that is, one with uncertain returns--above the compensation that would be demanded by risk-neutral investors who care only about expected returns.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is explaining the concept of a ""risk premium"" in financial terms, which is the additional compensation investors require for holding a risky security. This explanation does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a technical definition that does not reflect a change in monetary policy or the FOMC's stance on achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it references concerns about various economic factors such as equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and household debt. These concerns could potentially lead to either a hawkish or dovish stance depending on how they are interpreted in relation to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. However, without additional context on how these concerns will influence the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is prepared to tighten monetary policy if the economy shows signs of overheating and inflation rises to undesirably high levels. This suggests a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the U.S. economy, noting the transition from recovery to expansion and reflecting on the rapid and robust recovery in GDP. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide specific guidance on the direction of interest rates or other monetary tools. Instead, it offers a retrospective view of economic performance, which is a neutral statement in terms of monetary policy stance."
1,"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive employment situation with millions of new jobs created and a low unemployment rate that has been sustained over two years. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides a status update on employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. The statement does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather reflects a stable employment environment."
0,"In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries."" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding employment trends in other countries, which does not inherently suggest a particular action by the FOMC with respect to U.S. monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States."
2,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between inflation volatility and the inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, as estimated by a specific yield curve model. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses the mechanics of how inflation expectations are factored into bond yields. This is more of an observation of economic conditions and their effects on financial markets, rather than a statement of policy intent."
0,"Remarkably, 30-year Treasury yields were only slightly lower than 10-year yields throughout the episode, implying that the markets had no confidence that inflation would ever return to 1950s or 1960s levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market expectations regarding long-term interest rates and inflation, without directly indicating a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It reflects market perceptions rather than the FOMC's policy intentions. The observation about yield differences does not inherently suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general confidence in the current policy framework's ability to handle economic challenges, suggesting that the FOMC believes its existing strategy is appropriate for the current economic conditions. This statement is more about the adequacy of their policy tools and approach rather than a signal of imminent policy action."
2,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But what does this mean for monetary policy?"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It is a rhetorical question that could precede either a hawkish, dovish, or neutral policy stance, depending on the context that follows. Without additional context, it does not indicate a clear inclination towards tightening, easing, or maintaining the current monetary policy."
0,Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it is a neutral statement that reflects an observation about productivity changes. Increased productivity can have various implications for monetary policy, but without additional context on how this change in productivity affects employment, inflation, or interest rates, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. It simply provides information that may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC in their policy decisions."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses global economic conditions and their impact on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as improvements in the financial system's stability. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic and financial landscape. The mention of stronger regulation and improved risk management suggests a more resilient financial system, which is a desirable outcome for the FOMC, but it does not signal an immediate policy action."
2,Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank"" implies that the central bank has the tools and responsibility to control inflation. This suggests a stance where the central bank is willing to take action, such as tightening monetary policy, to ensure inflation remains in check, aligning with a hawkish view that prioritizes the control of inflation, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market participants' reactions to a report and the subsequent effect on Treasury yields, rather than directly stating the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence merely reflects the market's interpretation of the report's potential impact on future monetary policy decisions."
2,there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate"" does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about global economic conditions that could potentially impact the U.S. economy. The statement is neutral as it does not indicate a clear direction for future policy adjustments but rather acknowledges a change in external economic factors that could influence the Committee's future decisions. It implies neither an immediate concern for inflation that would warrant a hawkish stance, nor does it suggest a need for stimulus that would align with a dovish stance."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of inflation expectations without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy action. It suggests that if inflation expectations are well-anchored, actual inflation is likely to remain low and stable, assuming no significant economic shocks occur. This statement does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather underscores the importance of managing public expectations to achieve the FOMC's inflation target."
2,"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the relationship between equity price movements and investment spending. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a consideration of economic factors that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The sentence does not provide information on the Committee's views on inflation or employment, which are key factors in determining a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In the simplest version of his model, Bill assumed that the central bank could choose to specify its monetary policy actions in terms of a particular level of a monetary aggregate or a particular value of a short-term nominal interest rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical model of how a central bank might approach its monetary policy, by choosing to focus on either a monetary aggregate or a short-term nominal interest rate. It does not indicate a current policy stance or a change in policy direction, but rather discusses a general method of policy implementation. It does not provide information on whether the central bank is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral."
0,"The strong support from monetary policy, together with fiscal stimulus, should turn the K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that delivers full employment, as Mike McCracken would have wished.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the current monetary policy, in conjunction with fiscal stimulus, is aimed at supporting a broad-based and inclusive economic recovery that achieves full employment. This suggests an easing stance, as the policy is designed to stimulate the economy rather than to restrain it to combat inflation. The reference to a ""K-shaped recovery"" turning into a full employment scenario indicates a desire to address uneven economic outcomes, which aligns with a dovish approach to support growth and employment."
1,"When considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the context of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to get inflation under control.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on controlling inflation, which is currently seen as the primary challenge. This suggests a willingness to potentially tighten monetary policy to address inflation, even if it might pose risks to the labor market. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures, which can also have a cooling effect on employment growth."
0,"Without the accompanying boost to productivity, our progress toward price stability might well have been marked by the social pressures that arose in many previous episodes of disinflation both here and abroad.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that without an increase in productivity, efforts to achieve price stability (i.e., controlling inflation) could have led to social pressures, which are often associated with measures to tighten monetary policy. This suggests that the FOMC is aware of the potential negative consequences of disinflationary policies (which are typically hawkish as they involve raising interest rates or reducing the money supply) but deems them necessary to maintain price stability. The reference to ""previous episodes of disinflation"" indicates a willingness to accept these consequences to achieve the goal of stable prices, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it comments on the stability of exchange rates when underpinned by consistent policies and cost structures, which is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions."
2,"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about credit access, particularly in the subprime mortgage market, and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states a fact about the availability of credit to households, including those with lower incomes, without suggesting any particular action or concern that would lead to a change in monetary policy. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest an adjustment to the policy in response to inflation or employment shortfalls."
1,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's commitment to a policy framework that targets inflation outcomes aligned with their long-term goal of a 2% inflation rate. It does not directly indicate an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reaffirms the strategy adopted to maintain price stability over time. The focus on keeping inflation expectations anchored suggests a balanced approach to managing inflation consistent with their stated objectives."
2,"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process and the information-sharing protocol among the members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) during policy meetings, particularly before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the thoroughness and consistency of the information that informs the committee's decisions. This process-oriented statement reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not provide insight into the direction of policy adjustments."
0,"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential feedback loop where declines in wealth could negatively impact economic activity, which in turn could affect financial markets. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the interconnectedness of economic factors and potential risks, reflecting a balanced view on economic conditions without a clear direction on policy adjustments."
1,"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation is significantly above the target level, and it emphasizes the importance of returning to the inflation target to achieve the FOMC's mandated goals. This suggests a stance that would support tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level."
2,The 5.4% unemployment rate in 1996 was the lowest annual rate since 1988 and before that since 1973.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement of fact regarding unemployment rates in specific years and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides context on employment trends."
0,"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a structural economic issue related to labor market dynamics and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges the impact of technical change on the labor market, which is a factor outside the direct influence of monetary policy. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action regarding tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges faced by unskilled workers in adapting to technological advancements."
1,"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of central bank independence and the importance of a mandate for price stability, but it does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more about the structural and governance aspect of the central bank rather than an immediate policy direction."
2,"Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is considering the effects of climate change and associated policies as factors in setting monetary policy. This reflects an awareness of additional variables that could impact the economy and the Fed's dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. However, the sentence does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an inclusion of broader considerations in their policy framework."
1,This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities--and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential inflation due to monetary expansion, suggesting that if this expansion is not counteracted by selling securities (sterilization), inflation could result. The mention of the difficulty in continuing sterilization due to the scale of debt indicates a bias towards preventing inflation, which aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on controlling inflation, even if it means less monetary stimulus."
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of considering the time lag between policy implementation and its effects on the economy, and it reflects a balanced approach to achieving the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the need for forward-looking decision-making based on projected economic conditions."
2,"Required down payments, usually about half of the home's purchase price, excluded many households from the market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition of the housing market related to the size of required down payments and their effect on household participation in the market. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on market conditions that could be relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not suggest a specific monetary policy action."
2,Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to past economic events and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It provides context or a case study for discussion rather than a clear signal of the FOMC's current policy direction."
2,You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a rhetorical question that reflects on the complexity of monetary policymaking and the need for extensive knowledge. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information about current economic conditions or policy adjustments. It is more of a philosophical or procedural inquiry rather than a statement of policy direction."
2,"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in measuring quality changes in personal computers and how these may not be adequately reflected in published price indexes. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic data measurement rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a theoretical viewpoint on market efficiency and asset pricing, rather than directly indicating a current or future stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather reflects a perspective on how markets might function in theory. This statement does not provide clear insights into the Committee's actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"Despite the progress to date and the signs of acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is well below where it should be, considering the pre-pandemic trend.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that employment levels have not yet fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels and suggests that there is still significant slack in the labor market. This implies that the FOMC may be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support further improvement in employment, consistent with its goal of maximum employment. The focus on the shortfall in employment, without mentioning concerns about inflation, suggests a dovish stance aimed at easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and job growth."
2,"Over the 1994-2002 period, seven prominent inflation-targeting industrial countries had a mean inflation rate of consumer prices of 2.1 percent per year with a standard deviation of 1.7 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a historical fact about the inflation rates in certain countries during a specific period. It does not indicate any current or future policy stance or suggest any action to be taken by the FOMC. It neither implies a need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy, but rather provides context or background information related to inflation targeting practices."
1,"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively taking measures to control inflation and return it to their target rate of 2 percent. The mention of ""taking action"" suggests that they are likely tightening monetary policy to address higher inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The reference to the rapid pace of economic growth being boosted by previous accommodative (easier) fiscal and monetary policy, and the observation that demand has moderated as those policies have become less supportive, further implies that the current policy is less accommodative than before."
1,"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the negative impact of higher inflation on economic growth in the longer term. This suggests that the FOMC might prioritize controlling inflation, potentially through tightening monetary policy, to ensure long-term economic stability, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to prevent inflation from harming economic growth."
1,The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a consensus view on the relationship between price stability and other monetary policy goals, without indicating a specific direction for policy action. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather acknowledges a general principle agreed upon by economists and central bankers. The statement reflects an understanding of the FOMC's objectives but does not provide information on any current or future policy adjustments."
0,"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is recognizing a correction in equity prices, which suggests a potential slowdown in economic activity, including consumer spending and business investment. This observation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The FOMC might be inclined to raise interest rates or take other measures to stabilize prices and moderate long-term interest rates, even in the face of a potential reduction in economic growth, to maintain their commitment to stable prices."
1,"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights a higher adjusted unemployment rate than the headline figure, suggesting that the labor market is weaker than it appears. This implies that there may be more slack in the labor market, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate employment, in line with their commitment to maximum employment."
2,"In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if long-term interest rates do not respond as expected to forward-looking indicators, short-term interest rates might need to be increased more aggressively to influence long-term rates and, consequently, economic activity. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy more than usual to achieve the desired economic outcomes, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that an active monetary policy response to financial instability could lead to excessive risk-taking, which is often associated with a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent future crises. This suggests a tilt towards preventing overheating in the economy, which is a hawkish perspective."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate during the 1988-90 period, stating that they were not especially surprising or anomalous. This statement does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reflects a retrospective assessment of economic conditions without suggesting any immediate policy action. It is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a need to adjust the monetary stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing educational and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. This is more of a structural issue rather than a direct monetary policy action. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes long-term economic health and productivity, which aligns with the FOMC's broader goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the impact of weak foreign demand on the value of the dollar, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It neither indicates an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on international economic factors that could influence the FOMC's decision-making."
2,"Reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and demand for these liabilitiesâ€”notably, currency in circulationâ€”grows over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual situation regarding the composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the growth in demand for its liabilities, including currency in circulation. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on the structural aspects of the Federal Reserve's financial position, which is neutral with respect to the direction of monetary policy."
1,"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that China's fluctuating COVID containment measures, particularly the revival of travel restrictions, could lead to an increase in inflation, which is considered an ""upside risk."" This implies that there may be upward pressure on prices due to potential supply chain disruptions or other economic impacts stemming from these restrictions. In the context of the FOMC's goals, an upside risk for inflation could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"""2 One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""rational inattention"" in the context of how actual inflation may influence future inflation expectations. This concept suggests that people pay less attention to economic information that changes infrequently or has a minor impact on their decisions. The statement itself does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the psychological and informational factors that play a role in economic behavior, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC uses to inform its policy decisions. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to the monetary policy stance."
2,"Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments or the FOMC's stance on future policy moves. Instead, it indicates an intention to clarify misunderstandings about the inflation targeting framework, which is a part of the FOMC's communication strategy. The sentence aims to enhance transparency and understanding without suggesting a particular policy action."
2,"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the importance of inflation expectations as a factor in monetary policy assessment, alongside the natural rate of unemployment (u*) and the neutral rate of interest (r*). It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the role of inflation expectations in the decision-making process. This reflects a balanced approach to considering how expectations might influence the pursuit of the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"that is, the capacity utilization rate is lower than would have been expected, based on past experience, at the prevailing unemployment rate.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the capacity utilization rate is lower than expected given the current unemployment rate. This implies that there is slack in the economy, which means there is less pressure on prices to rise and therefore less immediate need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The FOMC might consider this an indication to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment and economic activity, aligning with a dovish stance."
0,"In 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States,","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions (sluggish growth abroad and global developments affecting investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It provides context on the economic environment that the FOMC is considering but does not indicate whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing policy. It is simply an assessment of the economic situation at the time."
2,One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of behavioral finance theories on predictions for asset prices and saving behavior, which is more of an academic observation rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide clear insights into the Committee's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it is best classified as neutral."
1,"Nevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the potential risk that inflation poses to the economic outlook. When the FOMC identifies inflation as a primary risk, it often suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy can include raising interest rates or other measures to reduce liquidity, which are considered hawkish actions. The focus on inflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests that the Committee might prioritize combating inflation even if it could potentially impact employment or interest rates in the short term."
2,"As stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the composition of household portfolios and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy nor provides insight into the FOMC's future actions related to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the increase in oil prices has had only a modest impact, suggesting that there is no immediate or significant pressure on inflation that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy, but rather an observation of current economic conditions."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to correct market misperceptions about the economy or the Federal Reserve's intentions, particularly if these misperceptions are leading to incorrect pricing. This suggests that the Federal Reserve is willing to take action, potentially by adjusting monetary policy, to ensure that market prices reflect the economic reality and the Fed's policy stance. Such actions would likely involve tightening monetary policy if prices are too high due to an overly optimistic view of the economy or dovish expectations of the Fed's intentions. The use of ""prove them wrong"" indicates a proactive approach to countering these misperceptions, which is more aligned with a hawkish stance."
0,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an interest in exploring methods to target interest rates more continuously and in a way that complements forward guidance. Specifically, it mentions the potential use of yield curve caps in conjunction with forward guidance that ties the decision to raise rates from the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) to employment and inflation outcomes. This suggests a policy tool that would keep interest rates low for a longer period, conditioned on achieving certain economic targets, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity."
