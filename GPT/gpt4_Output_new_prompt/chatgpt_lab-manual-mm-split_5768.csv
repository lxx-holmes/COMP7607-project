2,"In discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggesting that long-term unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment does.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are skeptical about the idea that long-term unemployment has less of an effect on suppressing wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment. This skepticism could lead to a belief that the labor market is tighter than some studies suggest, which might put upward pressure on wages and prices, potentially leading to higher inflation. If the FOMC believes that inflation pressures are stronger, they may be more inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target, which is a hawkish stance."
1,"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the potential negative consequences of further asset purchases, such as complications in withdrawing policy accommodation, inflationary risks, and threats to financial stability. These concerns suggest a cautious or skeptical view of further easing monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance that favors tightening to prevent inflation and ensure financial stability."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, indicating that the market's long-term inflation expectations (inflation compensation) have not significantly changed. This observation does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather indicates a stable market outlook on inflation. The FOMC might view this stability as consistent with their inflation goals, suggesting no immediate pressure to adjust their policy stance."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have agreed to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, suggesting that they do not see a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy at this time. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a shift towards more aggressive inflation control (hawkish) or stimulus (dovish)."
2,Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are advocating for a wait-and-see approach, gathering more data before deciding on any changes to monetary policy. This suggests a balanced stance, neither explicitly favoring tightening nor easing of policy, but rather emphasizing the importance of additional information to guide future decisions."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it remains consistent with historical averages. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather communicates an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. This suggests a balanced approach without a clear lean towards either a more aggressive or accommodative policy stance."
1,Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It simply reports on market reactions to positive economic data, without suggesting any particular action or inclination by the FOMC to tighten or ease monetary policy. It is a descriptive statement about market conditions rather than a prescriptive statement about monetary policy actions."
2,"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe there is still slack in the labor market, as evidenced by certain labor market indicators (like the employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation rate for prime-age workers) not having fully recovered to pre-recession levels, and the lack of significant wage growth. This suggests that these participants do not see immediate inflationary pressures from the labor market, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
0,The deceleration seemed to reflect primarily an unwinding of heightened demand for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds that had boosted M2 in prior months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the deceleration in the growth of M2 (a measure of the money supply) is attributed to a change in investor behavior, rather than being a direct result of monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides an explanation for observed financial market dynamics. This explanation is neutral in terms of policy stance, as it does not indicate a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures suggest expectations of declining inflation in the near future, and medium-term inflation expectations have decreased over the period between meetings. This suggests that there is less concern about high inflation, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In a dovish stance, the FOMC might be more inclined to maintain or lower interest rates to support economic activity, given that inflation pressures appear to be subsiding."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio. It does not directly indicate a policy action or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting on recent employment trends, which could be seen as a sign of a healthy economy. However, without additional context on how these trends are affecting inflation or the FOMC's assessment of the balance of risks, it is not possible to classify the stance as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the statement is neutral."
0,"Long-term government bond yields declined and headline equity indexes increased, on net, in most of these countries, with bank stock prices in the euro area rising more than broader indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations, specifically the behavior of long-term government bond yields and equity indexes, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a context of the financial environment, which is part of the broader set of indicators the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions."
1,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the labor market is performing well, with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. This reflects positively on the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the sentence does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, as it does not explicitly mention concerns about inflation or other economic imbalances that would necessitate a policy response. It simply states a current condition of the labor market, which is one of the factors the FOMC considers in its policy decisions."
2,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that despite increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, which are typically expansionary monetary policy tools, the expected stimulative effect on the economy or prices might not materialize due to an impaired bank intermediation mechanism and banks' unwillingness to lend. This suggests that the FOMC is recognizing limitations in the transmission of monetary policy under current conditions, without clearly signaling a move towards either tightening or easing policy. It reflects an assessment of the situation rather than a direct policy stance."
1,"remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is being kept low due to weaker demand and previous drops in oil prices, which suggests that there is less upward pressure on inflation. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as inflation is not a current concern, and instead, there might be room for easing to support demand. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, particularly if inflation is running below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee believes additional tightening of monetary policy is necessary to maintain a balance between sustainable economic growth and price stability. ""Measured policy firming"" suggests an intent to increase interest rates or take other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,Domestic respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that lending standards are being tightened, which is a sign of a more restrictive monetary policy stance. Tighter lending standards can lead to reduced credit availability, which can slow down economic activity, aligning with a hawkish approach to control inflation and ensure stable prices. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as it may help prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check."
2,"Some restraint on aggregate demand would come from other sectors of the economy--notably government spending, net exports, housing, and perhaps business inventories.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that certain sectors of the economy are expected to naturally moderate the aggregate demand without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a direct intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The mention of ""restraint on aggregate demand"" could be seen as leaning towards a hawkish stance, as it implies a slowing down of economic activity which could alleviate inflationary pressures. However, since the restraint is attributed to sectors like government spending and net exports rather than to monetary policy actions, it does not clearly signal a tightening of policy. Therefore, the stance is best described as neutral, acknowledging the state of the economy without indicating a move towards either more aggressive or more accommodative monetary policy."
2,"Meeting Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants-the four members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the twelve Federal Reserve Banks-provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about the process of the FOMC meeting, where participants provided their economic projections. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather describes a step in the Committee's information-gathering and decision-making process. This action is part of the FOMC's commitment to informed policy-making but does not in itself suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The members expected price pressures to remain relatively contained over the next several quarters in the context of what they anticipated would be only a gradual reduction of the excess capacity in labor and product markets as the recovery progressed.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members anticipate low inflationary pressures in the near term, with a slow reduction in excess capacity in labor and product markets. This implies that there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and the stance is therefore more accommodative or 'dovish,' as it indicates a leaning towards easing rather than tightening."
2,"Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that the expectations for economic growth have not significantly changed. This suggests a steady outlook without immediate implications for changes in monetary policy, aligning with a neutral stance."
0,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite positive developments, there are factors expected to limit economic growth. This suggests a cautious or pessimistic outlook on the economy, which could imply a preference for an easing monetary policy stance to support expansion, aligning with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of ""restrain the expansion"" implies that the Committee might consider measures to stimulate growth, which is typically associated with a dovish stance."
0,"In general, financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that financial markets are in a state that could support stronger economic growth, but it does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply assesses the current condition of financial markets in relation to economic expansion, without a clear directional policy stance."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economic activity was stronger than expected at the end of 1996 and continued to be strong into 1997. This surprising strength in economic activity could lead to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Therefore, the statement suggests a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider raising interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the observed increase in inflation is expected to be temporary, given the ongoing slack in labor and product markets and stable long-term inflation expectations. The mention of inflation being transitory, especially if there are no significant further increases in oil and other commodity prices, implies that the FOMC does not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat inflation. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus might be on supporting employment and economic growth rather than on fighting inflation."
0,This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC's action was a response to increased concerns and uncertainty due to recent terrorist attacks, which could negatively impact asset prices and economic performance. This suggests that the FOMC may be leaning towards easing monetary policy to counteract the potential adverse effects on the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity in times of uncertainty and stress."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to continue or increase monetary stimulus through asset purchases unless there is a substantial improvement in the labor market, all while maintaining price stability. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is prepared to use its tools to support employment, which aligns with a dovish policy approach aimed at stimulating economic activity."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is planning to adjust policy in a way that is consistent with its long-term goals of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. The use of the term ""balanced approach"" suggests that the Committee is neither leaning towards an aggressive tightening of monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor towards an easing of policy (which would be dovish). Instead, the statement reflects a commitment to a measured and goal-oriented policy stance that is neither explicitly expansionary nor contractionary, but aimed at maintaining the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve."
1,"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability."" is neutral because it does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it suggests a balanced approach, with the Committee stating its readiness to adjust policy as necessary to achieve its dual mandate of promoting sustainable economic growth and maintaining price stability. This indicates a willingness to respond to changing economic conditions without committing to a specific policy action, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment levels are holding steady and labor markets remain tight, but there are also signs of softening. This suggests a balanced view where there is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The FOMC might interpret this as a situation where the current policy stance is appropriate given the mixed signals from the labor market, aligning with their goal of maximum employment without necessarily indicating a shift towards more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members do not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy due to expectations of low inflation. The emphasis on the lack of urgency and the anticipation that inflation will remain subdued suggests a leaning towards maintaining or easing the current policy stance rather than tightening it. This dovish stance aligns with a more accommodative approach to support economic activity, as there is no immediate concern for rising inflation that would typically warrant a hawkish response."
1,"However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if progress on employment and inflation is quicker than expected, the FOMC may raise the federal funds rate earlier than anticipated. Raising interest rates is a tool used to tighten monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. This action would be in response to potential concerns about inflation rising too quickly or employment surpassing maximum sustainable levels, which could lead to an overheating economy."
0,"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion among FOMC participants about credit spreads and their potential risks to aggregate demand and financial stability. It does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a consideration of financial conditions and potential risks, which is part of the Committee's balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and maintaining stability. The mention of both the risk of a sharp rise in spreads (which could suggest a future tightening if it threatens demand) and a continuation of the decline in spreads (which could suggest a future easing if it threatens financial stability) does not lean clearly towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where external factors (resolution of hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices) could lead to positive economic outcomes such as a boost in equity markets, consumer sentiment, and consumer spending. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather discusses potential economic developments that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC might adjust policy in response to these changes, but the sentence itself does not commit to either tightening or easing."
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty about the current level of resource slack in the economy, which suggests that the FOMC is considering both the possibility of the economy operating close to its potential and the potential for further gains in employment without a significant increase in labor force participation rates. This reflects a balanced view, as it does not clearly lean towards a need for tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexity of the economic situation, which could warrant a wait-and-see approach until more information becomes available."
2,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural step in the FOMC's meeting process, focusing on discussing economic conditions and policy implementation without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to considering the current economic situation and does not provide specific information on policy stance changes."
2,The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged"" does not explicitly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC's view on inflation has not changed significantly, which implies a steady approach to monetary policy without signaling any immediate action to adjust interest rates or other policy measures. This stance is consistent with maintaining the current policy until new data or economic conditions warrant a change."
2,"While numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting, a surge in motor vehicle sales in December fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year-end.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where holiday sales were generally disappointing but were offset by a surge in motor vehicle sales and a late pickup in retail sales, leading to moderate overall growth in consumer spending. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of recent economic conditions. The FOMC might see this as a balance between weaker and stronger areas of consumer spending, which does not necessarily call for an immediate policy response."
2,"Later in the period, AFE yields partially rebounded and foreign equity prices fully recovered on some easing of U. S. ­–China trade tensions, as well as perceptions of reduced political uncertainty in the United Kingdom and Italy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions to geopolitical events and does not directly indicate a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. The rebound in yields and recovery in equity prices due to easing trade tensions and reduced political uncertainty are external factors that the FOMC might consider, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reports on market conditions, which could be one of many inputs in the FOMC's decision-making process."
2,"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core consumer price indices have not increased significantly over the past year, particularly as measured by the PCE chain-price index, suggesting that inflationary pressures are not a major concern at the moment. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current monetary policy to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the risks to both growth and price stability as balanced for the upcoming quarters. This suggests that they do not currently see a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more aggressively, as the risks to their dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices are viewed as roughly equal. This balanced view is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) bias."
0,Participants expected economic activity to contract sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in early 2009.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' expectations regarding economic activity, predicting a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009. It does not directly indicate a future policy action such as tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it sets the stage for understanding the economic context in which the FOMC is operating. The stance of monetary policy in response to this expectation would depend on how the FOMC chooses to balance its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in light of the anticipated economic contraction."
2,inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will increase gradually due to a rebound in energy prices, but it does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to tighten or ease policy. The statement is balanced, acknowledging a factor that could influence inflation but without indicating a specific policy response."
2,"In general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation is aligning with the Committee's expectations and moving towards their target, suggesting that current monetary policy settings are appropriate to achieve their goals. There is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease the policy based on this statement alone."
0,"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions to economic data and policy assessments in the United Kingdom, specifically mentioning the decline in gilt yields and the weakening of the pound in response to inflation data and the Bank of England's revised assessment of labor market slack. This information does not directly indicate a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance, as it pertains to the UK's economic conditions and the Bank of England's actions rather than the Federal Reserve's policy decisions. Therefore, it does not clearly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC and is thus classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"Most participants remarked that the standard of ""substantial further progress"" had been met with regard to the Committee's price-stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants believe the Committee's goal of price stability has been achieved or is close to being achieved. This suggests that the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Achieving the price stability goal implies that the FOMC might raise interest rates or take other measures to ensure that inflation remains around their target level, especially if they perceive a risk of inflation running above the desired rate."
1,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering further policy firming, which typically means increasing interest rates to address inflation risks. This stance is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as it suggests actions may be taken to prevent inflation from rising above the Committee's long-term target of 2%. The mention of ""further policy firming"" directly relates to the goal of stable prices and indicates a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish position. The conditional nature of the statement, with the extent and timing depending on incoming economic data, does not change the overall hawkish tone, as it still implies a bias towards tightening."
1,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It merely reports on recent trade activity, with no explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. The widening trade deficit could have implications for employment and inflation, but without additional context on the FOMC's interpretation or response, the stance remains neutral."
0,"M2 growth picked up appreciably during December and January, evidently reflecting extra demands for liquidity and safety during the century-date-change period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there was an increase in M2 growth, which is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money. The increase is attributed to a temporary factor—the ""century-date-change period,"" which likely refers to concerns related to the Y2K issue at the turn of the century. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather reports on an observed economic phenomenon. The reference to ""extra demands for liquidity and safety"" suggests a temporary shift in behavior rather than a persistent economic trend that would warrant a monetary policy response. Therefore, the sentence does not clearly signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an explanation for a temporary fluctuation in monetary aggregates."
1,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the consumer price index (CPI) has risen, particularly due to an increase in consumer energy prices. This suggests inflationary pressures, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants' economic outlooks for growth and inflation have not changed significantly based on recent data. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a need to adjust its current monetary policy stance, as there is no indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced view consistent with maintaining the status quo rather than signaling a clear move in either direction."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail about their monetary policy tools rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. The setting of these ranges is part of the Committee's regular activities and does not inherently signal an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a continuation of a previously established policy rather than a new direction. The focus on maintaining these ranges suggests a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market reaction to an economic data release (the U.S. employment report for May) and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports on currency movements in response to new information, which does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of policy. The FOMC's focus on maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates is not directly addressed in terms of policy action in this sentence."
0,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concerns about negative business sentiment, disappointing growth in sales and profits, and excess capacity in capital and structures, which suggest economic weakness. These factors imply that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as the economy might benefit from supportive measures to stimulate investment and growth. The focus on adverse conditions aligns with a dovish stance, which is inclined towards easing monetary policy to support employment and economic activity when faced with such challenges."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges in predicting economic outcomes. This reflects a balanced view that is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance, as it neither commits to action nor suggests satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals."
2,"Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the potential for inflationary pressures due to higher energy and other costs, which could suggest a hawkish stance if these pressures were deemed significant. However, it also notes that core inflation has been relatively low in the recent past and that longer-term inflation expectations are contained, which could imply a dovish stance if the FOMC believes this trend will continue. The combination of these two observations suggests a balanced view on inflation, indicating that the FOMC is neither particularly inclined to tighten nor ease monetary policy based on the information provided in the sentence. This balanced view aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate is intended to offset an increase in the real federal funds rate due to a decline in inflation. This suggests a balancing act rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC appears to be making an adjustment to keep the real federal funds rate stable, which aligns with their goal of maintaining moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices, without necessarily indicating a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided not to change the previously set tentative ranges for money growth, due to substantial uncertainty in projections. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the status quo rather than signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The Committee's decision reflects a balanced stance, as they are neither committing to a policy that would stimulate the economy (dovish) nor to one that would restrict growth to combat inflation (hawkish). They are instead choosing to hold their current policy position until there is a clearer economic picture, which aligns with their goal of being responsive to changing economic conditions while pursuing long-term objectives."
2,The associated range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial sector debt was provisionally set at 3 to 7 percent for 1999.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides a projection for debt growth within the domestic nonfinancial sector. This statement is more descriptive of the economic conditions or expectations rather than prescriptive of monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest any changes to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools that would indicate a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"While accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates should continue to undergird consumer spending and the data on retail sales for July displayed relatively impressive gains, negative wealth effects from falling stock market prices, declining payrolls, and sluggish income gains--should they persist--might well depress consumer expenditures over coming months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence presents a balanced view of the economic outlook, acknowledging both positive and negative factors that could influence consumer spending. On one hand, it mentions supportive elements like accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates, which are generally associated with a dovish stance as they suggest a need to stimulate the economy. On the other hand, it also points out potential negative impacts from falling stock prices, declining payrolls, and sluggish income gains, which could lead to a reduction in consumer spending. These concerns might typically be associated with a hawkish stance if they were causing inflation to fall below target. However, the sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate shift in monetary policy but rather indicates a watchful approach to mixed economic signals. Therefore, the stance is NEUTRAL, reflecting a careful balance of risks without a clear direction toward tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"In addition, contacts reported that softer export sales, weaker economic activity abroad, and elevated levels of uncertainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans for investment spending.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that external factors such as softer export sales, weaker economic activity abroad, and high levels of global uncertainty are negatively impacting business sentiment and causing firms to reconsider investment spending. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds that could slow down growth and potentially lead to lower inflationary pressures. In this context, a dovish stance would be more likely as the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract these negative effects and support the economy in achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed situation where job growth has decelerated, but the unemployment rate has not increased, suggesting a potentially balanced labor market situation. This could be interpreted as the economy being in a state that does not immediately warrant a change in monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
0,"Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants see underutilization in the labor market, particularly noting the high number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time work. This view implies that the economy is not at risk of overheating and that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so to support further improvements in employment without risking a surge in inflation. This dovish stance aligns with a policy that would favor easing rather than tightening."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to adjust policy in a balanced manner, aiming to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a measured approach to future policy changes. This balanced approach reflects a neutral stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction but maintains a commitment to the FOMC's long-term objectives."
2,"Despite further declines in vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, business spending on nonresidential construction also seemed to have been lackluster, with such activity not having changed much since last summer.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of economic conditions, specifically in the real estate and business sectors, without directly suggesting an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It notes a mix of economic signals: declining vacancy rates and rising real estate prices could be signs of a strengthening economy, while lackluster business spending on nonresidential construction could indicate some underlying weakness or caution in the business sector. Since the sentence does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, it is best classified as neutral. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators to inform their policy decisions."
0,"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth and a slow reduction in unemployment, without explicitly indicating a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a steady approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without signaling a clear shift in policy stance."
1,"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where, in the absence of economic shocks and with appropriate monetary policy, there is an expectation of moderate economic growth and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate. This suggests a balanced view that does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a steady-state expectation consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear shift in policy stance."
1,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a solid increase in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate, which suggests that the labor market is strengthening. A stronger labor market typically leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could indicate a move towards a more hawkish stance to maintain price stability."
2,"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of current spending on equipment and software, attributing it mainly to replacement demand rather than investment that would increase the capital stock (capital deepening). This observation does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current state of business investment. It suggests that businesses are maintaining their capital rather than expanding it, which could be seen as a neutral indicator for monetary policy, as it does not strongly suggest upward or downward pressure on inflation or significant changes in employment levels due to increased productivity."
1,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Broaddus believes a tightening of monetary policy (which usually means increasing interest rates) is necessary due to strong aggregate demand. Tightening policy is a response typically taken to cool down the economy and prevent overheating, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain stable prices."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that the Federal Reserve's large-scale securities purchases were providing financial stimulus that would contribute to the gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee members are in agreement on continuing the Federal Reserve's large-scale securities purchases, which is a form of quantitative easing. This action is intended to provide financial stimulus, suggesting a move to encourage economic growth and suggesting an easing of monetary policy. The goal of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability aligns with the dovish stance of promoting economic activity without triggering high inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation is expected to stabilize near the FOMC's target rate of 2 percent by the end of the year. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively steering inflation towards the desired level, without indicating a clear need for either tightening or easing of policy. The expectation of inflation aligning with the target rate implies a balanced approach consistent with the FOMC's goals."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that some FOMC members anticipate that an increase in employment could lead to slower productivity growth, resulting in higher unit labor costs and potential upward pressure on prices. This suggests a concern for rising inflation, which would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. Therefore, the stance is considered hawkish, as it leans towards actions that would restrict monetary supply to combat inflation."
2,thought that potential output growth was likely to be a bit higher than forecast by the staff.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the potential output growth could be higher than what the staff forecasted. This implies that the economy might be capable of growing at a faster rate without leading to inflationary pressures, which could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating. A higher potential output growth rate indicates that the economy can sustain a higher level of activity without triggering inflation, thus the FOMC might consider this as a reason to adopt a more hawkish stance to keep inflation in check."
0,"Most projected somewhat slower growth through next year, and a smaller reduction in unemployment, than they had projected in April.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are expecting a slowdown in economic growth and a less pronounced decrease in unemployment compared to their previous projections. This outlook does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a cautious and observant stance. The FOMC may be waiting for more information before deciding on a policy change, thus maintaining a neutral position."
1,"Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a balance of factors influencing household spending, with positive aspects (higher employment and lower energy prices) and negative aspects (lessened stimulus from wealth gains and the need to rebuild savings). It does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it presents a mixed view of economic conditions that are neither overly strong nor weak. The FOMC might see this as a sign that the current policy stance is appropriate given the mixed economic signals."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low"" suggests that the expectations for future inflation are subdued, as reflected by financial market indicators. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity. The FOMC may interpret low inflation compensation as a sign that inflation is not a current threat to the stability of prices, one of their key mandates."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower. This indicates that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more than what is currently anticipated. The use of the word ""balanced"" implies that they believe the current policy stance is appropriate to maintain their inflation target and does not signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish approach."
1,Some participants mentioned upside risks around the inflation outlook that could arise if temporary factors influencing inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could be higher than anticipated if temporary factors are more enduring, suggesting a potential need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract these inflationary pressures. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates."
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants have revised their inflation projections upward because they believe that supply constraints in both product and labor markets are more significant and persistent than they had previously thought. This suggests a concern about higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract these pressures and bring inflation back towards the target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflation and cool down the economy."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants' expectations for economic growth are stable, with no significant changes from their previous projections. This suggests that they see the economy progressing as expected, without signaling a need for immediate policy adjustments to either tighten or ease monetary conditions. The statement reflects a balanced view consistent with a steady economic outlook, neither indicating a move towards a more aggressive stance (hawkish) nor suggesting a need for more accommodative measures (dovish)."
0,"A few members expressed interest in using language specifying a period of time during which the federal funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, arguing that such language might be better to indicate a constant stance of monetary policy over time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are advocating for language that suggests the federal funds rate will remain low for a certain period, rather than tying the low rate to a specific calendar date. This implies a preference for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended time to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The dovish stance is often associated with efforts to stimulate the economy, particularly when there is a need to boost employment or when inflation is below the Committee's long-term target."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees both economic activity and inflation projections as having more downside risk. This suggests that there is a concern about economic weakness and lower inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and move inflation towards the target level. This dovish stance implies a potential easing of policy to stimulate economic activity and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term goal of 2%."
0,"Indeed, some expressed the concern that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might run below mandate-consistent levels for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation might remain below the levels consistent with the FOMC's mandate, which suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling too low. This dovish stance implies that the FOMC might consider easing policy to address the issue of low inflation and to support the economy in reaching its inflation target."
2,"Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the participants' view that recent weather conditions have introduced additional uncertainty in interpreting economic data, particularly regarding employment and housing indicators. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges an external factor that could be temporarily influencing economic indicators. It reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions without suggesting a specific policy action."
0,"Most believed that downside risks to economic growth had diminished somewhat since the April meeting, but were still significant.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC members see some improvement in economic growth risks since their last meeting, they still consider the risks to be significant. This suggests a balanced view, acknowledging both positive changes and ongoing concerns, without clearly signaling an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a stance of cautious observation rather than a commitment to action in either direction."
0,Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation regarding fiscal policy's impact on economic growth. This statement is more of an economic outlook rather than a clear indication of future monetary policy actions. It suggests that the FOMC is aware of external factors that may affect the economy but does not imply an immediate response in terms of adjusting monetary policy."
2,"However, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite some improvements in labor utilization, there are still signs of underutilization in the labor market, such as low labor force participation, high numbers of discouraged workers, and many part-time workers who would prefer full-time work. Additionally, low rates of hiring and quits suggest that labor demand is not strong. This could imply that there is less pressure on wages and inflation, and therefore, there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to cool down the economy. The FOMC might maintain or introduce more accommodative measures to support employment, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes the balanced and data-driven process of considering various economic indicators. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without suggesting a current bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members view the risks of inflation increasing as less pressing than the risks of inflation decreasing in the near term. This suggests that they are more concerned about potential economic weakness or deflation than about overheating, which could imply a stance favoring easier monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent inflation from falling too far below their target."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October"" indicates a strong labor market, which could lead to inflationary pressures if the economy is near or at full employment. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concern about the difficulty in achieving the 2 percent inflation target, suggesting that inflation is currently below the desired level. This could indicate a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling further and to steer it back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective should not be overstated","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite some positive developments, there is a concern among some FOMC participants that the progress towards the inflation objective might be less significant than it appears. This caution implies a focus on the risk of inflation remaining above the target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to ensure that inflation moves back towards the Committee's 2% goal. The emphasis on not overstating progress towards the inflation objective indicates a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
1,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives ongoing risks of inflation, which suggests a concern that inflation could be higher than their target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,Participants judged that it would be appropriate to move the stance of monetary policy toward a neutral posture expeditiously.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants believe it is necessary to adjust the stance of monetary policy towards a neutral position quickly. This suggests a shift away from an accommodative policy, which is typically associated with lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, towards a stance that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. The use of the term ""expeditiously"" implies that the Committee is inclined to act sooner rather than later, which is often associated with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy or to combat higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Although productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinarily rapid pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion, data for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as preliminary indications for the first quarter of this year, suggested that gains from efficiency remained substantial.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where productivity growth has slowed but still indicates efficiency gains. This observation does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. It provides an assessment of economic conditions without a clear indication of how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. The sentence reflects an understanding of economic trends important for policy considerations but does not in itself advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that a participant is proposing the introduction of lower thresholds for inflation and unemployment, which would likely mean that the Federal Reserve would consider tightening monetary policy sooner (i.e., raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases) if these lower thresholds were reached. This is because lower thresholds could signal a lower tolerance for inflation and unemployment, aligning with a more aggressive stance on controlling inflation and maintaining low unemployment, which are indicative of a hawkish monetary policy."
2,"However, waiting was an acceptable alternative given the favorable economic news and the persisting uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC is weighing the positive economic indicators against the uncertainties in the economic environment. The use of the word ""waiting"" implies that the Committee is not immediately inclined to either tighten or ease monetary policy but is instead adopting a wait-and-see approach. This reflects a stance that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather one that is open to future adjustments as more information becomes available."
2,"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors are leading to an improvement in exports, which is generally positive for the U.S. economy. However, it does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The improvement in exports could potentially lead to higher economic growth and employment, aligning with the FOMC's goals, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate need for a policy adjustment. It simply provides an observation of current economic conditions without a direct implication for monetary policy actions."
2,"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and declines in government employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of employment trends, noting solid growth in nonfarm payroll employment and private-sector jobs, alongside declines in government employment. It does not directly indicate a policy action or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting on employment conditions, which is one of the FOMC's goals, without suggesting any particular policy response."
2,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that a specific measure of inflation (the trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas) is stable and aligns with the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation target of 2 percent. This suggests that current monetary policy is effectively maintaining price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that raising interest rates too soon could negatively impact the economic recovery and labor market conditions, which would be counterproductive to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. This suggests a preference for maintaining a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support continued economic growth and employment, rather than tightening policy, which would be consistent with a dovish outlook."
1,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members expect inflation to decrease in the near future, which implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy aggressively. This expectation of moderating inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a potential easing of concerns about high inflation and, therefore, potentially less need for immediate action to raise interest rates."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view on economic conditions. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects an assessment of various elements that could influence consumer behavior and, by extension, the broader economy. The mention of ""limiting factors"" implies that there are concerns to be addressed, but without further context, it's unclear whether these would lead to a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of uncertainties in labor market behavior and the economy's potential growth, without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It reflects a balanced view that acknowledges the complexities of economic indicators, which could lead to either tightening or easing policies depending on how these uncertainties resolve. The focus on uncertainties suggests that the FOMC is neither committing to a hawkish stance (tightening) nor a dovish stance (easing) but is instead maintaining a watchful and measured approach."
2,"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather suggests a steady, ongoing assessment of economic conditions relative to historical norms. It reflects a balanced approach without signaling a change in policy stance."
2,Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is merely an observation of market conditions, which could be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to policy in response to equity price movements, nor does it comment on the FOMC's primary goals of employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a consideration of the impact of longer-term interest rates on the economy, suggesting that the FOMC is monitoring the situation and is prepared to adjust its policy stance depending on whether rates stabilize or continue to rise. This indicates a balanced approach, weighing the potential effects on financial conditions and economic activity without committing to a specific policy action."
2,"By the same token, the rate of price inflation was lower than had been reported, consistent with the findings of a number of studies of distortions in published price data.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the rate of price inflation is lower than previously reported, which suggests that inflationary pressures are not as strong as might have been believed. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth, especially when inflation is not a pressing concern."
2,"With longer-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, changes in commodity and import prices expected to be modest, and significant resource slack persisting over the forecast period, inflation was forecast to be subdued through 2015.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of low inflation due to stable long-run inflation expectations, modest changes in commodity and import prices, and significant resource slack. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy or maintain current policy settings."
2,"Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants believe the low inflation readings are temporary, as indicated by the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation remaining near the 2% target. This implies confidence in the inflation rate returning to the target level without further easing measures, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check."
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting recent financial developments and concerns about the foreign economic outlook, as well as the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential negative impacts on economic growth and inflation, suggesting that the economy might be facing headwinds. The mention of risks being ""tilted to the downside"" and the acknowledgment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy seemed well-prepared to counter adverse shocks imply that there may be a need for a more accommodative policy stance to support the economy. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goals of fostering maximum employment and stable prices, especially when there is an indication that the economy might not be robust enough to handle negative events without policy intervention."
2,"Businesses added a bit to their inventory positions after an extended period of sizable declines, but final sales changed little: business capital spending weakened somewhat further while growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays slowed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation with some areas showing slight improvement (businesses adding to inventory) and others indicating weakness (weakened business capital spending, slower growth in consumer spending, residential housing expenditures, and government outlays). This mixed picture does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, as there are no strong indications of overheating (which would be hawkish) or significant underperformance (which would be dovish). Instead, it presents a balanced view of the economy, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising energy and commodity prices leading to higher inflation and lower growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, even at the risk of further slowing down economic growth. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflation aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that economic activity and labor demand have been growing at an unsustainable pace, which is likely to lead to increased inflation unless the policy is tightened. This suggests a need for a more restrictive monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The mention of ""policy action"" implies that the member is advocating for measures to tighten monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, to slow down the pace of economic activity and demand."
0,"Indeed, the members did not rule out the emergence of appreciably lower inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members acknowledge the possibility of inflation decreasing significantly, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus might shift towards supporting employment and economic growth if inflationary pressures are perceived to be waning."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy through this extended period of weakness, which aligns with a dovish stance."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is currently low and any increase in inflationary pressures is expected to rise slowly. This indicates that there is no immediate concern for inflation to overshoot the target, which would typically prompt a tightening of monetary policy. The mention of strong demand against the backdrop of stable financial conditions implies that the economy is performing well without generating significant inflation, which could justify a more accommodative stance or at least no rush to tighten policy. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, as it suggests there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or ease further to support demand without risking the FOMC's inflation target."
0,"Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where there is an improvement in housing demand and consumer spending, which could be seen as positive indicators for the economy, suggesting a potential for a more hawkish stance if these trends continue. However, it also mentions that capital spending is weak due to business uncertainty and pessimism, which could be a concern for economic growth and might warrant a dovish response to stimulate investment. The combination of both positive and negative economic indicators suggests a balanced or unclear stance, as the FOMC might consider both the strengths and weaknesses in the economy before deciding on a clear direction for monetary policy."
0,"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC meeting participants are concerned about weak labor market conditions and expect high unemployment to persist, which suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support job growth and economic recovery. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, one of its key goals."
2,"In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to remove a statement about risks to growth and inflation, suggesting that they no longer see those risks as pressing or relevant. This does not directly imply an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment that the previous concerns are no longer a factor in their policy considerations. It suggests a balanced view where the previous risks to their goals of maximum employment and stable prices are not currently seen as threats that would necessitate a change in policy stance."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where household spending is strong despite an economic downturn, suggesting resilience in that sector, but it also indicates potential limitations on future growth in spending. Additionally, it mentions competitive pressures that could limit profits, investment, and equity prices. This reflects a balanced view of the economy, with both positive and negative aspects, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The focus is on the observation of current economic conditions rather than a direct policy stance."
1,"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures,","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that a recent decline in the dollar could contribute to increased inflation pressures. This suggests a concern about rising inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these pressures and maintain their inflation target. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,still being clear about the Committee's intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee intends to provide monetary accommodation, which typically means implementing policies to lower interest rates or otherwise stimulate the economy. This is consistent with a dovish stance, as it suggests a focus on supporting economic growth and employment, and a willingness to tolerate or address lower-than-target inflation. The reference to ""a return to maximum employment and stable prices"" implies that the current situation may be below these targets, and thus, accommodative measures are deemed necessary to achieve the FOMC's goals."
2,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of economic conditions, noting a moderation in household spending growth but also recognizing strong growth in business fixed investment. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather presents a mixed view of economic activity. This balanced perspective aligns with a neutral stance, as it does not clearly advocate for a policy shift in either direction."
1,"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various positive economic indicators, such as a decline in the cost of business capital, increased orders for nondefense capital goods, gains in productivity, stronger business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs. These observations suggest an improving economic environment, which could potentially support both the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general assessment of economic conditions that could be used to inform future policy decisions. The FOMC might view these conditions as supportive of their long-term goals without necessitating an immediate policy response, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
0,they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that economic data has been stronger than expected, which has led to concerns about the sustainability of current domestic asset prices. This suggests that there may be a risk of overheating in the economy, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such concerns, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
1,"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise due to the end or reversal of temporary factors that were keeping prices low. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to keep inflation in check."
2,"Looking ahead, reports from retailer contacts were somewhat mixed; many anticipated relatively depressed holiday sales and where possible were making efforts to limit buildups of holiday merchandise, while other retailers were confident that sales would be reasonably well maintained, albeit generally somewhat below levels or growth rates experienced in previous holiday seasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes mixed expectations among retailers regarding future sales, with some anticipating lower sales and others expecting sales to be maintained, though at lower levels than in previous years. This information does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments, as it reflects uncertainty and varied outlooks rather than a definitive economic trend that would necessitate either tightening or easing of policy. It suggests a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion about the operational aspects of implementing monetary policy, specifically open market operations, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a procedural aspect of how the Federal Reserve conducts its policy rather than a stance on the policy itself."
2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees no immediate need to tighten monetary policy due to low inflation and underutilized resources. This suggests a stance towards easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation, aligning with a dovish approach to support economic activity and employment."
2,the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about the limited impact of past changes in the dollar's foreign exchange value on core consumer prices, without suggesting a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply states a fact about the relationship between exchange rates and inflation, without implying a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In keeping with the practice at meetings when the Committee establishes its long-run ranges for growth of the money and debt aggregates, the members of the Committee and the Federal Reserve Bank presidents not currently serving as members had prepared individual projections of economic activity, the rate of unemployment, and inflation for the year 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural aspect of the FOMC's meetings, specifically the preparation of individual projections for economic activity, unemployment, and inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects the Committee's practice of gathering data and forecasts to inform their policy decisions. This is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and evidence-based decision-making, but it does not reveal any particular policy direction."
2,"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt over a specified period, which indicates a steady approach rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. This suggests a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the current economic conditions without signaling a shift towards more aggressive inflation control (hawkish) or economic stimulus (dovish)."
2,"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting growth near the economy's potential and more balanced risks compared to previous assessments. They also anticipate that inflation will remain constrained under these conditions. This suggests that the FOMC sees no immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively, as the current situation is aligned with their goals of stable prices and maximum employment. The use of the word ""constrained"" in relation to inflation suggests satisfaction with the current inflation trajectory, which aligns with their target, and the mention of ""balanced risks"" implies that they do not see a clear bias towards either an overheating or underperforming economy."
0,The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of growth next year,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of growth next year"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that there has been a minor adjustment to the growth forecast. This could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context and does not inherently suggest a move to either increase or decrease interest rates or adjust monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions, which is a necessary input for policy decisions, but does not in itself convey the Committee's policy response."
0,"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there have been declines in payroll employment and industrial production, which suggests economic weakness. A dovish stance is typically associated with monetary policy that aims to stimulate the economy in the face of such weakness. The fact that the declines were smaller than those earlier in the year does not change the dovish implication, as it still points to ongoing economic challenges that the FOMC might address with an easing policy to support employment and economic activity."
1,"Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates strong employment growth and a low unemployment rate, which could signal a robust economy nearing full employment. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to inflationary pressures, suggesting a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail about their monetary policy tools rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather indicates a continuation of previously set targets. This suggests a steady approach consistent with their long-term objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It reaffirms the Committee's ongoing commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, which is a standard objective of the FOMC. The sentence does not indicate a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance."
2,"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the current risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, which suggests that they do not currently see a strong need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The mention of closely monitoring inflation developments implies vigilance over price stability—one of the key goals of the FOMC—but does not in itself signal an immediate predisposition towards raising or lowering interest rates. Therefore, the stance is neutral, reflecting an approach of watchfulness and readiness to adjust policy as needed to maintain their objectives."
1,the prices of some key commodities had increased recently.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""the prices of some key commodities had increased recently"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states an observation regarding commodity prices, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, such as supply disruptions or changes in demand. Without additional context on the implications for inflation or how the FOMC might respond to these price changes, the stance remains neutral. It does not directly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it does not specify whether these price increases are causing inflation to deviate from the target or affecting employment levels."
0,"Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is subdued and has not increased, even when considering core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy items). This suggests that there is no immediate inflationary pressure warranting a tightening of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies there may be room for easing to stimulate the economy without the risk of triggering high inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is exhibiting strong demand and tightness, which often correlates with upward pressure on wages and potential inflationary concerns. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that certain members of the FOMC expect to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until they are confident that the economy has overcome recent challenges and is on course to meet the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a stance of monetary policy easing or at least a pause in tightening, as they are not advocating for an increase in the target range, which would be a typical response to concerns about inflation exceeding the target rate. Instead, they are focused on ensuring economic recovery and stability before considering policy tightening, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run above the 2% target temporarily to achieve the long-term average of 2%. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy or being less aggressive in tightening, in order to support economic activity and boost inflation towards the desired level."
2,"as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that headline PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation, which includes food and energy prices and is a broader measure of inflation, was expected to exceed core PCE price inflation, which excludes these volatile categories. This suggests that overall inflation was anticipated to be higher, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. A higher headline inflation expectation typically prompts a hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability."
2,Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the data is inconclusive or has both positive and negative aspects, which does not provide a strong basis for a policy shift in either direction. Therefore, the stance is neutral, reflecting a wait-and-see approach or a continuation of current policy until clearer trends emerge."
0,"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is committed to continuing its purchases of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace. This action is aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of the markets for these securities, which is a form of monetary easing. By doing so, the FOMC is fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, which typically involves lowering interest rates or making credit more available to stimulate economic activity. This approach is consistent with a dovish stance, as it suggests measures to support the economy rather than to restrict it, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance focused on tightening monetary policy to combat inflation."
0,"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain the federal funds rate at a very low level due to low rates of resource utilization and a subdued inflation outlook. This suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing support for the economy over concerns about inflation, which is consistent with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and employment. The commitment to keeping rates low for an extended period also signals a willingness to provide ongoing monetary accommodation."
0,The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected slowdown in business investment spending and potential computer markets, attributing it to factors that are not directly related to monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of certain economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on market saturation and replacement demand indicates a neutral observation of economic trends without a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment."
1,Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential rising inflation pressures due to strong demand and supportive conditions in financial markets. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
0,"A number of participants noted that continued high unemployment, particularly with large numbers of workers suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead to an erosion of workers' skills that would have adverse consequences for those workers and for the economy's potential level of output in the longer term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern over high unemployment and its long-term negative effects on the economy, suggesting that the FOMC might favor policies that support employment, even at the risk of higher inflation in the short term. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which typically involves keeping interest rates lower to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a negative impact on real income growth due to higher energy prices but also recognizes positive developments in the form of solid wage and salary increases. This suggests a balanced view of economic conditions, with both inflationary pressures and signs of a healthy labor market. It does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a mixed economic situation."
2,"In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that","NEUTRAL

The provided sentence does not contain enough information to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It begins to describe the FOMC members' consensus on the inflation outlook but does not indicate whether they believe inflation pressures are rising or falling, or what actions, if any, they might take in response. Without further context on whether the members' assessment leads to a concern about higher inflation (which might be hawkish) or lower inflation (which might be dovish), or whether it suggests a balanced view with no immediate need for policy change, we cannot classify the stance as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, it is neutral."
0,"In the staff forecast prepared for this meeting, the economy was seen as likely to expand at a moderate pace, supported by accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy is expected to grow at a moderate pace with the help of accommodative monetary policy and financial conditions. ""Accommodative"" monetary policy typically means that the central bank is aiming to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other measures that make borrowing easier, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing rather than tightening. This approach is in line with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if the economy is not overheating and inflation is not above the target."
0,"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the housing market's response to lower mortgage rates, indicating some increase in refinancing and purchase activity. However, it also expresses uncertainty about the long-term impact on housing demand. This statement does not clearly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions related to interest rates and their effects on the housing market. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring various economic indicators to inform their policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for future policy."
1,Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are worried about rising inflation expectations due to very stimulative macroeconomic policies and accelerating economic growth. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,"With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth slowing down to align with the potential output growth, which suggests a forecast of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic outlook. The FOMC may use such information to inform future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not commit to a hawkish or dovish direction."
0,"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a positive trend in unemployment (a decline) but also recognizes that it is still higher than desired. This suggests a balanced view without a clear indication of a policy shift towards tightening or easing. It reflects an ongoing assessment of the employment situation, which is one of the FOMC's goals, without signaling a change in monetary policy stance."
0,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a very low target range for the federal funds rate, which is a dovish stance. This decision reflects an intention to stimulate the economy by keeping borrowing costs low until their employment and inflation objectives are met. The specific mention of waiting until inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to exceed this level moderately suggests a tolerance for higher inflation in the short term, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. This stance is aimed at supporting economic activity and employment, consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of inflation compensation without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It notes a modest decline in inflation compensation, possibly due to lower energy prices, but also mentions stability at longer maturities. This suggests a balanced view of inflation expectations, without a strong implication for immediate policy tightening or easing."
0,"Housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a weakening in the housing market, with declining housing starts, falling house prices, and high inventories of unsold homes. This suggests that the economy might be facing downward pressures, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate demand and counteract these negative trends. The description aligns with a dovish approach as it indicates a potential shortfall in employment and economic activity, which the FOMC might address through more accommodative policy measures to support its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, noting that equity prices have risen despite increased volatility. This statement does not explicitly suggest a need to adjust the monetary policy to counteract inflation or to stimulate the economy, nor does it provide clear insights into the FOMC's future actions regarding interest rates or other monetary policy tools. It is a neutral comment on financial market developments without a direct policy implication."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the effectiveness and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance that could lead to either an increase or decrease in asset purchases depending on how the economic data evolves. It does not commit to either a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather to a data-dependent approach that could go in either direction, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
1,"Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period"" is a statement of fact regarding commodity prices and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Rising crude oil prices could potentially lead to inflationary pressures, which might warrant a hawkish response, but the sentence itself does not state any intended policy action by the FOMC in response to this observation. Therefore, without additional context on how the FOMC plans to address the impact of rising oil prices, the stance remains neutral."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of various securities to provide support to private credit markets and economic activity. This action is consistent with an easing of monetary policy, as it involves injecting liquidity into the financial system, which is typically done to stimulate the economy during periods of slower growth or economic downturns. The aim of such purchases is often to lower long-term interest rates, encourage borrowing, and support employment and price stability when the economy is underperforming. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is characterized by efforts to stimulate the economy and is generally associated with lower interest rates and expansionary monetary policy."
2,Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above-trend pace of economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that some FOMC members believe a stronger labor market or an economy growing faster than its trend rate could influence their outlook, which is likely related to monetary policy decisions. A strengthening labor market and above-trend economic activity could lead to increased inflationary pressures, which would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is more aligned with a hawkish stance, as it suggests conditions that could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating."
0,"At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued,","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the yields at longer maturities decreased due to data suggesting that economic growth would be moderate and inflation would remain subdued. This implies that there is less concern about overheating in the economy or rising inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and help achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The use of the word ""subdued"" in relation to inflation particularly suggests a dovish tilt, as it implies that inflation is not a current concern and therefore does not warrant tightening of monetary policy."
1,Pressures on resources would rise as the anticipated upturn and possible above-trend growth brought the economy closer to full capacity utilization.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the economy is expected to experience an upturn and possibly grow above its trend, which would lead to increased utilization of resources and bring the economy closer to full capacity. This scenario suggests that there could be upward pressure on inflation as the economy heats up, which may require the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The focus on full capacity utilization aligns with the goal of stable prices, and a move towards tightening would be consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of slower growth in the money supply (M2 and M3), which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. This could be seen as a measure to control inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. By moderating the growth of the money supply, the FOMC is likely aiming to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in price inflation, the core inflation (excluding volatile energy prices) remains relatively subdued. This suggests that the FOMC does not see immediate inflationary pressures that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish stance), nor does it indicate significant deflationary risks that would require an easing of policy (dovish stance). The statement seems to convey a balanced view on inflation, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"The absence of further large gains in stock prices, should recent trends persist, would remove this stimulus and probably induce some moderation in the growth of consumer spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential scenario where a lack of significant increases in stock prices might lead to a decrease in the growth rate of consumer spending. This statement is more of an observation of market dynamics and their possible impact on consumer behavior rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather acknowledges how external economic factors could influence consumer spending, which is a component of economic activity that the FOMC monitors."
0,"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Kocherlakota believes the Committee's forward guidance is not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing measures to raise inflation to the 2 percent target. His dissent suggests that he advocates for a more accommodative policy stance to address inflation that is persistently below the desired level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in February established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3. This action in itself does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Committee's use of monetary aggregates as one of the tools to gauge economic conditions and guide its policy decisions. The establishment of growth ranges for these aggregates is a technical decision and does not inherently signal an intent to raise or lower interest rates. It is a neutral action aimed at achieving the broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to remove policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases, at a pace that is ""likely to be measured."" This suggests a gradual tightening of monetary policy. The reference to ""underlying inflation expected to be relatively low"" implies that the FOMC is confident in proceeding with tightening without the immediate pressure of high inflation, aiming to preemptively manage inflation risks while supporting their long-term goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations of inflation, which does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. This statement is simply an observation of market conditions, which seems to imply a steady state without signaling a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
0,These participants concluded that the Committee should wait to take another step in removing accommodation until the data on economic activity provided a greater level of confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that certain FOMC participants are advocating for a pause in tightening monetary policy until there is more confidence in the economy's strength to handle potential negative demand shocks. This indicates a preference for maintaining or increasing monetary accommodation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate economic activity."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that employment gains were stronger than expected, which could suggest that the economy is heating up and potentially creating inflationary pressures. In response to such conditions, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance. This action would be consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and moderating long-term interest rates, especially if the employment gains suggest a risk of surpassing the Committee's target inflation rate."
2,"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that labor costs, which are a component of overall inflation, have not been rising. This suggests that there is less pressure on inflation from the labor market, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. A dovish stance is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to being informed and data-driven when making policy decisions. The sentence shows the FOMC's dedication to transparency and careful consideration of economic indicators, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected pattern of economic growth relative to the staff's estimate of potential growth, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that output is expected to grow slightly above potential in the near term and then slow down, which does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. This suggests a balanced view that is consistent with monitoring economic conditions as they evolve."
1,"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants expect that a tightening (""firming"") of monetary policy will be appropriate to bring inflation back to the Committee's 2 percent target while maintaining a strong labor market. This suggests a bias towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate change in the Committee's assessment of economic conditions that would warrant a shift in monetary policy. It reflects a balanced outlook without signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing policy."
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about recent inflation trends, attributing them to specific factors (oil and gasoline prices), without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor implies a need for easing (which would be dovish). Instead, it simply states a cause for the recent pickup in inflation, which is part of the FOMC's monitoring but does not by itself dictate a policy response."
2,"To a considerable extent, however, any uptick in inflation expectations likely represented a reversal of anticipated declines in inflation earlier this year when economic prospects had seemed weaker and survey data did not confirm any increase in long-term inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the increase in inflation expectations might be a correction from previous lower expectations due to weaker economic prospects, rather than a sign of an ongoing upward trend in inflation. It suggests that there is no clear evidence of a sustained change in long-term inflation expectations, which would warrant a change in monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (easing policy), but rather reflects a wait-and-see approach that is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary tool for adjusting monetary policy—the target range for the federal funds rate—without indicating a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It simply states the mechanism the Committee uses to influence monetary conditions to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is currently inclined to raise, lower, or maintain the federal funds rate, thus it is considered a neutral statement regarding policy stance."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through July and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an update on employment conditions, indicating that nonfarm payroll employment has been growing and the unemployment rate has remained stable. This information by itself does not suggest a clear direction for a change in monetary policy. It reflects a situation where employment is expanding, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but without additional context on inflation or other economic indicators, it does not indicate whether the FOMC should adopt a more hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the sentence is classified as neutral."
0,"In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are considering a more accommodative monetary policy stance by suggesting a lower unemployment threshold before considering raising the federal funds rate. This implies a willingness to keep interest rates low to support employment, which is consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,"Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where, despite a significant rise in the consumer price index, which could suggest inflationary pressures (a hawkish concern), the inflation expectations (measured by inflation compensation from Treasury securities) did not change much during the same period. The mention of inflation compensation remaining ""a bit above"" pre-Hurricane Katrina levels does not clearly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC is monitoring inflation but does not provide a clear signal of immediate tightening or easing of policy. The balanced nature of the observation, noting both an increase in CPI and stable inflation expectations, leads to a classification of NEUTRAL."
2,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, higher or lower, depending on economic, financial, and monetary developments. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee willing to respond to changes in the economic environment to achieve its long-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth. The use of ""somewhat higher"" and ""slightly lower"" implies small adjustments rather than significant shifts in policy, reflecting a stance that is neither clearly tightening nor easing but rather maintaining flexibility."
2,Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends"" suggests that inflation is neither accelerating nor decelerating significantly, which implies that the current monetary policy stance may be appropriate to maintain the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not clearly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition where residential construction activity is robust, partially due to lower mortgage interest rates. This observation does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the housing market and its relationship with interest rates, without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might view this as a positive sign for economic activity and employment, but it does not necessarily imply a need to change the current policy stance."
2,"Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low compared to the levels that the FOMC sees as consistent with its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices over the longer term. This suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation towards the Committee's 2% target, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite an increase in input costs, there is limited transmission of these costs to consumer prices, implying that inflationary pressures may not be as strong as the cost increases might suggest. This could mean that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, as the impact on consumer prices is not pronounced."
0,The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a decrease in headline inflation due to falling energy prices, as suggested by futures markets. This suggests that inflationary pressures are expected to ease, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. A dovish stance typically supports the idea of maintaining or reducing interest rates to stimulate economic activity when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the Committee's target of 2%, suggesting that there is less immediate concern about overheating in the economy. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to support inflation moving towards the target, rather than needing to tighten policy to prevent excessive inflation."
0,"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current monetary policy is expected to stimulate economic growth to a point where GDP growth exceeds potential growth, which would likely reduce unemployment to very low levels. This scenario implies that the economy is operating above its potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In this context, a ""highly accommodative"" monetary policy stance may need to be tightened to prevent overheating, which is a hawkish signal."
0,"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a scenario where economic activity is severely disrupted, resulting in lower real GDP and inflation, and a higher unemployment rate. This suggests that the economy is underperforming relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In such a context, a dovish stance would be appropriate, as it would imply a need for easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and counteract the negative trends in GDP, inflation, and employment."
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is concern about potential lower-than-expected inflation (downside risks), the majority view is that the risks to the inflation outlook are evenly balanced between upside and downside risks. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone, as the risks are seen as balanced. This balanced view is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) position."
2,"Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that real GDP growth will align with potential output increases, suggesting a balance between economic growth and inflation pressures. It does not explicitly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy to either tighten or ease conditions, thus reflecting a neutral stance."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a situation where the FOMC might not see an immediate need to adjust monetary policy aggressively in either direction to achieve its inflation target, as expectations are stable. It reflects a balanced view that does not clearly signal an intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expansion in monetary aggregates due to increased demand for currency and inflows to retail money market funds, which is happening during a period of weakness in the U.S. bond and equity markets. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's monitoring of various economic indicators, which could later influence their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy direction."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants believe tightening monetary policy is appropriate to address inflation concerns. The use of the term ""firming of the stance of monetary policy"" suggests an intention to increase interest rates or take other actions to reduce inflationary pressures. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is typically associated with measures to cool down an overheating economy and bring inflation back towards the Committee's target."
1,Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Total nonfarm payroll employment expanded at a solid pace in July and August"" provides information about the state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's key concerns. However, without additional context on whether this expansion is above or below the Committee's expectations or how it relates to their policy goals, it's not clear whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting a fact about employment growth, which could be consistent with a healthy economy, but does not in itself indicate a change in policy stance."
2,Real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is rapid growth in real outlays for office and computing equipment, with prices for certain types of equipment falling. This information alone does not clearly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It suggests that there is economic activity in terms of investment in equipment, which could be positive for employment, but the decline in prices for personal computers and networking equipment could be a sign of technological progress or competitive pricing rather than a direct indicator of inflation trends. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any immediate action on monetary policy, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"The December employment report showed that job growth had slowed appreciably, and other indicators also pointed to emerging weakness in the labor market in the intermeeting period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that job growth has slowed and there are signs of weakening in the labor market. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support employment, one of its key mandates, especially if the labor market continues to show signs of weakness. Easing monetary policy in response to a slowing job market is consistent with a dovish stance, as it aims to stimulate economic activity and prevent a downturn in employment."
0,"This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core PCE price inflation, which is a measure of underlying inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices, has decreased compared to the previous year. A decline in inflation suggests that there is less pressure on prices, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could be seen as a sign that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth without triggering unwanted inflation."
2,Most other interest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most other interest rates in short-term markets were little changed over the period"" does not explicitly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states that there has been little change in short-term interest rates, which suggests a steady state without clear intent to adjust monetary policy in either direction. This can be seen as a balanced or unclear stance, as it does not reflect a move towards the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it signal a response to economic disturbances. It is a descriptive statement about market conditions rather than a prescriptive statement about policy actions."
1,An upside risk was that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that inflation could rise more than anticipated in an economy operating above its potential, which implies a risk of overheating. This concern would typically lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and bring inflation back towards the FOMC's target."
0,"In these circumstances, an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding, with positive implications, at least for a time, for the expansion of economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is an anticipation of economic improvement following a period of uncertainty, which would lead to an increase in inventory rebuilding and, consequently, economic expansion. The mention of ""an easing at some point of current uncertainties"" suggests that the FOMC is considering or is open to the possibility of easing monetary policy to support this expected improvement in economic conditions. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with measures that stimulate economic growth, such as lowering interest rates or other forms of monetary easing."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that threaten its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to economic conditions. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining readiness to act in either direction as necessary to achieve the FOMC's goals."
0,PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price inflation is expected to remain significantly above the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent by the end of the year. This suggests that inflationary pressures are persisting, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's consideration of ways to improve the transparency of their economic outlook and policy judgments through the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on communication strategies. The discussion of enhancing the SEP is about providing clearer information to the public and does not inherently suggest a shift in policy direction."
2,"On balance, most participants still expected inflation to moderate later this year and in 2009.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that most FOMC participants expect inflation to decrease in the future, but it does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a forecast or expectation rather than a clear stance on policy direction. The expectation of moderating inflation aligns with the goal of stable prices, but without additional context on policy adjustments, the stance remains neutral."
0,The weakness in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions, specifically mentioning the impact of weak commodity prices and a stronger dollar on the energy and agricultural sectors, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic factors that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions, but it does not in itself indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about the potential impact of productivity on employment levels. While increased productivity can lead to less need for additional hiring, this statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action for the FOMC to take regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. It is a neutral comment on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions based on how they affect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Auctions of GSE debt following the conservatorship announcement reportedly attracted heavy demand, but market participants indicated that liquidity in the secondary market for GSE debt remained somewhat lower than normal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions and liquidity conditions following a specific event (the conservatorship announcement for Government-Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs) but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply reports on market conditions without suggesting a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat"" suggests that expectations for future inflation have decreased, which could imply that there is less pressure on prices to rise. This could be interpreted as a sign that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there may be less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In a dovish stance, the central bank might be more inclined to keep interest rates lower to support economic activity, as lower inflation expectations reduce the urgency to increase rates."
1,They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is growing at a strong, potentially unsustainable rate, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The use of ""unsustainable rate"" implies that the current growth pace may exceed the economy's long-term potential, which often warrants a hawkish response to ensure stability and adherence to the 2% inflation target."
1,"It was possible, though, that investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the uncertainty in inflation prospects, which does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a contemplative stance, acknowledging the complexity of interpreting market signals without committing to a specific policy direction. The FOMC is recognizing the challenges in forecasting inflation, which is a key factor in their decision-making process, but the sentence does not reveal a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish policy response."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, which includes the June employment report and the Chairman's testimony, leading them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a change in market perception based on the interpretation of external communications and data. The sentence itself does not provide information on the direction of the policy shift, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that labor market conditions had improved further in late 2015 even as economic growth slowed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an improvement in labor market conditions, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, it also mentions that economic growth has slowed, which could be a concern for the FOMC's objective of moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices. The sentence does not explicitly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic conditions. The improvement in employment could be seen as a positive sign, while the slowdown in economic growth could be a cause for caution, balancing out to a neutral stance."
1,Some price increases had been noted,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Some price increases had been noted"" suggests that there is an observation of rising prices, which could be indicative of inflationary pressures. Given the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and a 2% inflation target, noting price increases could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decrease below the level that the FOMC associates with its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. The anticipated slowdown in inflation is attributed to recent declines in energy and commodity prices, as well as a period of significant economic slack. This outlook implies that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not seen as a current threat, and there may be room for accommodative measures to support employment without risking the FOMC's price stability goal."
2,"These indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resilience of the financial system in the face of increased volatility and falling asset prices, without directly suggesting a need for a change in monetary policy. It indicates that the system coped well with the stress, which does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the FOMC views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower, indicating a stance that is neither particularly inclined towards tightening nor easing monetary policy. This balanced view implies that the Committee does not see a clear need to adjust policy in either direction to achieve its inflation goal at the moment."
