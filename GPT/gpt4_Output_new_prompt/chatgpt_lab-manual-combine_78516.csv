2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the increase in inflation is expected to be temporary and is associated with slack in labor and product markets, as well as stable long-term inflation expectations. This implies that the FOMC does not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat inflation, especially if oil and commodity prices remain stable. The use of the word ""transitory"" in relation to inflation indicates a view that the current inflationary pressures may not warrant a hawkish response, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing monetary policy to encourage employment and economic growth."
2,Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net"" is a factual statement about market conditions and does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that the FOMC may consider in their decision-making process."
0,"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the behavior of some emerging-market economies in response to exchange rate pressures, specifically their intervention to prevent currency appreciation by purchasing dollars. This statement is more of an observation of international economic actions rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States."
2,"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical observation about the economic conditions in 1996, noting the simultaneous attainment of low unemployment and inflation levels. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a change in the stance of monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a past situation where the goals of maximum employment and stable prices were met. This statement is descriptive and does not suggest a leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,A few participants particularly stressed the high uncertainty associated with the expected future path of the unemployment rate and commented that the unemployment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about the potential for a higher-than-expected increase in the unemployment rate, which suggests a risk of economic downturn or weakness. This concern would typically lead to a dovish stance, as the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support employment, one of its key mandates, especially if there is a risk of unemployment rising significantly. Easing policy could involve lowering interest rates or implementing other measures to stimulate economic activity and prevent a rise in unemployment."
1,All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that all members of the FOMC are concerned about the risks of not achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation. This concern suggests that the FOMC is focused on the goal of price stability and may be inclined to tighten monetary policy to ensure that inflation decreases to their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to manage inflationary pressures."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly if there is a risk of inflation, suggesting a stance that leans towards preventing inflation even at the cost of potentially slowing down economic activity. This indicates a bias towards a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical approach to understanding changes in the term premium, which is a component of interest rates, by referring to research literature. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy actions such as raising or lowering interest rates, nor does it provide specific information on the FOMC's goals of employment or inflation. Instead, it reflects a neutral, analytical perspective on economic conditions and financial market dynamics."
2,"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current assessment of the relationship between unemployment and inflation, suggesting that changes in unemployment have a limited effect on inflation. This observation does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions. It implies that the FOMC might not need to react aggressively to changes in unemployment with respect to inflation targets, which is a balanced view consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,"That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential shift in consumer spending patterns from goods to services, which could naturally help reduce inflation. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather suggests that changes in consumer behavior could contribute to achieving the FOMC's inflation goals. This is a neutral observation on economic dynamics rather than a statement of policy stance."
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the recent spike in inflation is temporary and not widespread across the economy. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy (such as raising interest rates) to combat inflation, as it is expected to subside on its own. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which typically involves maintaining or easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not seen as a persistent problem."
0,"However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is merely an observation of economic activity, specifically in the housing finance sector, which could be influenced by various factors, including previous monetary policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a policy adjustment to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"The logic goes as follows: Easier monetary policy, for example, raises stock prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that easier monetary policy, which typically involves lowering interest rates or purchasing assets, leads to higher stock prices. This suggests a relationship where loosening monetary policy has a stimulative effect on the economy, which is the opposite of a tightening stance. However, the classification as HAWKISH is based on the context that the statement is explaining a mechanism rather than advocating for a policy change. It is acknowledging the effect of an easier policy without necessarily endorsing it. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this understanding could be used to justify a tightening of policy (hence the HAWKISH classification) if stock prices are rising too quickly, which could lead to financial imbalances or contribute to inflationary pressures, moving away from the FOMC's target inflation rate and potentially impacting long-term interest rates and employment."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for financial markets to develop tools and methods to more accurately detect changes in the general price level. This statement is more about the capabilities of financial markets to assess inflation rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on the FOMC's future actions. It is simply a neutral observation about market developments and their possible future ability to measure inflation."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. To maintain stable prices and achieve its 2% inflation target, the FOMC might lean towards tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The authorization and direction to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions could imply that the FOMC is prepared to adjust its policy tools, such as the federal funds rate, to manage the pace of economic expansion and keep inflation in check."
2,"Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low compared to the levels that the FOMC deems consistent with its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices over the longer term. This suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation towards the Committee's 2% target, which could involve keeping interest rates lower or other easing measures. The stance is dovish because it implies a concern for too-low inflation rather than too-high inflation, which would necessitate a tightening of policy."
2,"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged, while wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in Japan where consumer prices remained stable and wholesale prices experienced a slight increase compared to the previous year. This information is more of an economic observation rather than an indication of a specific monetary policy stance. It does not directly suggest a need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC, as it is a report on past inflation data in a foreign economy rather than a forward-looking statement about domestic monetary policy actions."
2,"Progress at Home and Abroad Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been an improvement in inflation and economic activity, suggesting that the previous concerns about negative external influences have lessened. This statement does not explicitly signal an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather acknowledges positive economic developments. It reflects a balanced view without a clear direction towards either a more aggressive or accommodative policy stance."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) approach to its price-stability mandate, emphasizing the goal of maintaining inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, especially when the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound during economic downturns. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the importance of managing inflation expectations within the existing policy framework. It reflects a commitment to the inflation target, acknowledging the challenges in achieving this goal under certain economic conditions without suggesting immediate policy action."
2,"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding the impact of declining oil prices on emerging markets, without directly suggesting a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It is a statement of fact about external economic conditions rather than a clear indication of the FOMC's future policy actions. The FOMC may take such information into account when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy response."
2,"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the forecasting process and the need for consistency across various economic variables in the staff's overall view of the economy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a procedural aspect of how economic forecasts are made to align with the broader economic outlook. This is part of the FOMC's approach to making informed decisions but does not in itself suggest a change in policy direction."
1,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is above its historical average, which suggests that monetary policy is tighter than usual. A higher real federal funds rate typically corresponds to efforts to slow down economic activity and control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to tighten monetary policy."
0,"Moreover, the resulting robust gains in labor productivity have been well ahead of compensation growth and have dramatically boosted corporate profits.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that labor productivity has increased significantly more than compensation growth, leading to a substantial rise in corporate profits. This suggests that the economy might be operating efficiently with low inflationary pressure from wages, which could provide room for the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and ensure price stability. The robust gains in productivity without corresponding increases in wages could mean that the economy is not facing upward pressure on inflation from labor costs, which is a factor the FOMC might take into account when deciding to raise interest rates or otherwise tighten policy to maintain their inflation target."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view on economic conditions. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects an assessment of various elements that could influence consumer behavior and, by extension, the broader economy. The mention of ""limiting factors"" implies that there are concerns to be addressed, but without further context, it's unclear whether these would lead to a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation are low and that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are stable. This suggests that there is no clear pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone. The FOMC might view this as a sign that inflation is not deviating significantly from their target, which would not necessitate a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where household spending is strong despite an economic downturn, suggesting that there may not be much scope for further growth in this area. Additionally, it mentions competitive pressures that could limit profits, investment, and equity prices. This assessment does not clearly indicate a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of current economic conditions. It reflects a balanced view that acknowledges both a positive aspect (robust household spending) and potential challenges (competitive pressures), without suggesting a specific monetary policy action."
2,"The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee expects inflation to decrease to levels that align with their goals of stable prices and maximum employment. This anticipation of lower inflation could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The dovish implication is that if inflation is under control or expected to be lower, the FOMC may not need to raise interest rates aggressively to curb inflation, and might instead focus on supporting employment and economic growth."
0,"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to achieving the 2 percent inflation objective, with an emphasis on preventing inflation from persisting above this target. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to prevent higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
1,Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability for achieving maximum employment, which is one of the FOMC's key objectives. It does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather states a principle that guides the FOMC's long-term policy decisions. Price stability is a precondition for a healthy economy, which in turn supports the goal of maximum employment. This statement is consistent with the FOMC's dual mandate and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that a gradual adjustment in monetary policy will lead to moderate economic expansion and strengthening labor market indicators. This suggests a balanced approach to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of ""gradual adjustments"" implies a careful and measured approach to policy changes, aiming to maintain economic stability and growth while also keeping an eye on employment and inflation targets."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine process of the FOMC, where participants submit their economic projections based on their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (neither tightening nor easing) but rather reflects the Committee's ongoing practice of evaluating economic conditions and outlooks to inform their policy decisions. The mention of projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation in conjunction with appropriate monetary policy suggests a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that higher energy prices are having a negative impact on real incomes, which in turn is likely reducing consumer spending. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds that could lead to lower inflationary pressures and potentially a shortfall in employment. In this context, a dovish stance would be more likely, as the Federal Reserve might consider easing monetary policy to counteract these negative effects and support economic activity."
2,"Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about measurement practices for inflation in the Euro area after a monetary union and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to adjust interest rates nor provides insight into the Committee's views on economic conditions that would warrant a change in monetary policy."
1,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a neutral observation about productivity growth, which does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an economic condition that could potentially influence the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest any specific policy action. Productivity growth can impact both employment and inflation, but without additional context on how the FOMC might respond to this observation, the stance remains neutral."
1,"Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about inflation being persistent and broad-based, rather than confined to specific sectors influenced by energy costs. This suggests that the FOMC sees a risk of inflation not decreasing as quickly or as much as desired, despite tight resource utilization (which usually refers to high employment and production near capacity). The mention of tight resource utilization and broad-based price increases implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
2,"Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern among FOMC members that an easing of monetary policy could lead to an unjustified surge in stock market prices, potentially resulting in a disruptive correction later on. This concern about the risk of market instability and the implication that policy easing might not be appropriate suggests a preference for maintaining or tightening monetary policy to prevent such an outcome, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of the Federal Reserve's tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary conditions. This is in line with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with policies that are aimed at stimulating the economy, such as lowering interest rates or purchasing assets, to support employment and stabilize prices, especially during challenging times."
2,I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation"" is a statement of economic principle rather than a direct indication of policy action. It neither suggests an immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need to ease policy to stimulate growth (which would be dovish). Instead, it reflects a neutral understanding that economic growth and inflation are not directly correlated, which is consistent with the FOMC's balanced approach to monitoring a range of economic indicators and adjusting policy accordingly."
1,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of employment trends, noting a recovery with strong job gains after initial drops. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's key considerations. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments but reflects on recent economic developments."
0,"To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it discusses an economic observation that could potentially impact domestic demand due to foreign producers. This statement is more descriptive of economic conditions rather than prescriptive of monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest any adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"Continued gains in employment and income, high household net worth, and low gasoline prices were viewed as factors that should support consumer spending in coming months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes current economic conditions that are positive and supportive of consumer spending, such as employment gains, income growth, high household net worth, and low gasoline prices. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of factors that could influence economic activity. The statement is balanced and does not suggest immediate concerns about inflation or employment that would prompt a change in monetary policy stance."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower. This indicates that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more than what is currently expected or communicated. The use of the word ""balanced"" implies that they believe the current policy stance is appropriate to maintain their inflation target and does not signal a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy."
0,"The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's consideration of international economic conditions and their effects on the United States, both from its own policy actions and from foreign economic circumstances. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges the interconnectedness of global economies and the need to consider these factors in policy decisions. This reflects a balanced approach to understanding the economic environment without signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,Surveys indicated that households’ expectations of inflation over the next year were little changed in February while households’ and professional forecasters’ longer-term inflation expectations edged lower.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests that short-term expectations are stable and that there is a slight decline in long-term expectations, which could be seen as neither a strong signal for tightening nor easing policy. The FOMC might view stable short-term expectations as aligned with their goals, while the decline in long-term expectations could be interpreted as confidence in the FOMC's ability to maintain inflation targets over the long run."
1,Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that participants expect inflation to rise due to pressures from a tightening labor market, which typically leads to an increase in wages as employers compete for a smaller pool of available workers. This expectation of higher inflation could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy."
1,"Moreover, it was difficult to anticipate how much the higher food and energy prices might affect inflation expectations and wage demands and thereby potentially become embedded more generally in the price structure.","HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for higher food and energy prices to affect inflation expectations and wage demands, which could lead to more widespread inflationary pressures. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent these factors from becoming ""embedded"" in the overall price structure, in line with their goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about consumer spending and housing demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy. It suggests a slowdown in consumer durables spending and a modest increase in housing demand, which could be seen as a balanced view of economic conditions, neither pointing towards a need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy. The statement is more of an economic forecast and does not explicitly suggest any immediate action by the FOMC."
2,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the behavior of equity prices during different phases of the economic cycle, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It simply acknowledges a pattern in financial markets that is not directly tied to the current stance or future changes in monetary policy."
1,"A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment is growing steadily and labor compensation is increasing at a moderate rate. This suggests a balanced view of the labor market, with neither significant overheating (which might warrant a HAWKISH stance) nor weakness (which might suggest a DOVISH stance). The use of the word ""moderately"" implies that the increases in labor compensation are not so large as to raise immediate inflation concerns, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The overall tone suggests that the current state of employment and wage growth does not necessitate a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather supports a continuation of the current policy stance."
2,"Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the relationship between asset prices and key macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate, without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It neither indicates a need to tighten nor ease the monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions."
0,"Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability.","DOVISH

The sentence implies a concern that raising interest rates in response to economic ""bubbles"" could potentially worsen economic instability rather than mitigate it. This suggests a caution against tightening monetary policy too quickly or aggressively, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while interest rates are low, the debt servicing requirement as a proportion of homeowners' income remains consistent with historical averages. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation through excessive borrowing nor is it too restrictive, as the debt burden is manageable for homeowners. It reflects a balance between the goals of promoting economic activity (through low interest rates) and maintaining financial stability (by keeping debt servicing manageable), without a clear indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring economic indicators such as unit labor costs and profit margins, which can influence inflation and employment. However, it does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of ""careful attention"" implies vigilance and readiness to act if necessary, but it does not commit to a specific policy direction. The acknowledgment of ""robust"" productivity growth is a positive sign, but the need to monitor other developments suggests a balanced approach, aligning with a neutral stance."
2,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a natural moderation in economic activity due to a projected slowdown in inventory investment, which does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might see this as a factor to monitor rather than a trigger for action, as it does not explicitly relate to deviations from their employment or inflation targets."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes multifactor productivity and its components, which include technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment. This is a factual statement about economic productivity and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the FOMC's current policy actions or future intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"We include these types of price terms today in our forecasting equations, and they are important to forming our views of the inflation outlook and thus to the policy process.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the inclusion of certain price terms in forecasting equations, which are important for forming views on the inflation outlook and influencing the policy process. This statement does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the use of data to inform policy decisions. It reflects a balanced approach to considering how inflation forecasts impact policy, without suggesting any immediate action to either increase or decrease the monetary policy's restrictiveness."
0,U.S. inflation remains muted.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""U.S. inflation remains muted"" suggests that inflation is not currently a concern as it is low or not increasing significantly. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to encourage economic growth and employment."
1,The implication is that monetary policy is already well positioned to slow the expansion.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current stance of monetary policy is expected to decelerate economic growth, which implies that the policy is already tight enough to restrain the expansion. This is indicative of a hawkish stance, as it implies that the Federal Reserve believes no further easing is necessary and is focused on preventing the economy from overheating, aligning with their goals of stable prices and managing inflation."
1,More information might provide a better sense of how the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and perhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the considerable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a stance of observation and data gathering to better understand the impact of current policy measures (higher interest rates) on aggregate demand and the relationship between output and inflation. This suggests a balanced approach, waiting for more information before making any policy changes, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3 over a specific period. This action in itself does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a tool for monitoring and guiding economic conditions towards the Committee's long-term goals. The establishment of growth ranges for monetary aggregates is a part of the broader strategy to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without explicitly signaling an immediate move to raise or lower interest rates."
0,"The steepening of the yield curve was due mostly to sharply lower short- and intermediate-term forward rates, consistent with investors' apparently more pessimistic outlook for economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that investors have a more pessimistic outlook for economic growth, as evidenced by the steepening of the yield curve due to lower short- and intermediate-term forward rates. This suggests that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates, as economic growth is not overheating, and therefore, the FOMC might lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to support economic activity. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goals of fostering maximum employment and stable prices, especially if economic growth is at risk."
1,But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation, suggesting that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to take action (potentially including raising interest rates or tightening monetary policy) to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation from rising above the target level."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that nonfarm payroll employment, a key indicator of economic health and labor market strength, increased significantly in October. This could suggest that the economy is performing well, potentially leading to upward pressure on wages and inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, strong employment growth might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil have already begun tightening their monetary policy by increasing interest rates in response to expectations of higher inflation. Tightening monetary policy, which often involves raising interest rates, is a measure taken to control inflation and is thus considered a hawkish stance. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the action described is a classic example of a hawkish policy response to inflationary pressures."
2,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic conditions, highlighting the strength in household spending without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges the positive role of consumer spending in balancing weaker areas of the economy, but does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"In particular, the Committee noted that it would respond as necessary to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining price stability, which often involves tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This suggests a readiness to take action, which could include raising interest rates or other measures to prevent inflation from rising above the target level."
1,"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe the economy is operating near its potential and that strong spending could lead to tighter resource markets and increased inflation pressures. This suggests a concern for rising inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the reliability of financial market signals in assessing economic conditions and monetary policy parameters such as the natural rate of interest (r*) and expected inflation. It suggests caution in interpreting market fluctuations, which aligns with the FOMC's principle of using a wide range of indicators to inform policy decisions."
2,"In the United States, evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices have been an integral part of the development of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general approach to monetary policy, stating that the evaluation of the effects of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices is a part of the policy development process. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the consideration of financial stability factors in policy formulation. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance, which typically involves lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity, for a significant period even after the conclusion of their asset purchase program and as the economic recovery gains strength. This approach is aimed at supporting further progress towards the goals of maximum employment and price stability, suggesting a focus on stimulating the economy rather than containing inflation, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
2,"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general assessment of economic conditions in Asian economies and does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on economic performance in Asia, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC."
2,"Job growth last month was fairly widespread, although heavy hiring in the construction sector was due partly to efforts to repair damage from the four hurricanes that hit the southeastern states.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where job growth is observed across various sectors, with a specific mention of the construction sector experiencing heavy hiring due to a temporary event (hurricane damage repair). This does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on employment trends. The fact that the hiring boost is attributed to a temporary event suggests that it may not have a lasting impact on the overall monetary policy stance, which aims for sustained employment growth. The FOMC would likely view this as a transitory factor in the broader context of employment and not something that would immediately shift their policy stance."
2,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But what does this mean for monetary policy?"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It is a question that suggests a consideration or assessment is to follow, but it does not indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy stance. Therefore, without additional context, the stance is unclear or balanced, which classifies it as neutral."
2,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, higher or lower, depending on economic, financial, and monetary developments. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee showing flexibility to respond to changing conditions in order to achieve its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth. The use of ""might be acceptable"" and ""would be acceptable"" indicates a readiness to adapt policy as necessary, without a clear bias towards tightening or easing."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that rising oil prices are expected to lead to higher consumer energy prices, which could contribute to inflation. This expectation of inflationary pressure might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the potential impact of a policy direction on the conduct of monetary policy without indicating whether the policy would be more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish). It poses a question about the effectiveness of a change rather than suggesting a specific direction for policy, thus it is neutral with respect to the stance of monetary policy."
2,"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants view recent lower inflation readings as potentially temporary and point to a measure of inflation (the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation) that has been stable around the target rate of 2 percent. This suggests that they do not see a need for an easing of monetary policy to combat lower inflation, as the underlying trend remains consistent with their target. The mention of stability in a key inflation measure implies a readiness to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"The recent rebound in oil prices contributed to a strong appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, and the Mexican peso.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external factors (oil prices) have led to currency appreciation in countries outside of the United States. This statement does not directly indicate a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance towards either tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of international economic conditions, which may be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The impact on U.S. monetary policy would depend on the broader economic implications of these currency movements and how they might affect the U.S. economy's progress toward maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC members expect inflation to moderate, they still see the need for vigilance regarding inflation developments. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation does not decrease as anticipated, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation, even if the current trend suggests a potential easing in the future. The commitment to ""continue to monitor inflation developments carefully"" implies that the FOMC is focused on its goal of stable prices and is prepared to adjust policy to prevent inflation from deviating from its target."
0,"However, some participants indicated that underlying inflation remained subdued; that longer-term inflation expectations were likely to remain anchored, partly because modest changes in labor costs would constrain inflation trends; and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is subdued and that inflation expectations are stable, with labor costs not exerting significant upward pressure on inflation. Additionally, it expresses concern that tightening monetary policy prematurely could harm the economic recovery. This indicates a preference for maintaining or easing monetary policy to support growth, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is closely monitoring inflation trends and expectations, which is a standard part of their mandate to ensure price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows a continued commitment to vigilance regarding inflation. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance,"" which often suggests readiness to act against inflationary pressures. This vigilance is typically associated with a hawkish outlook, where the central bank is closely monitoring economic indicators that might warrant an increase in interest rates to maintain price stability."
0,"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on clarifying the Federal Reserve's communication strategy regarding its employment goals rather than signaling a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC is considering how to better explain its criteria for judging employment gains, which is a neutral action in terms of policy stance. It neither directly implies an imminent policy change nor suggests a leaning towards more accommodative or restrictive measures. Instead, it reflects an emphasis on transparency and effective communication about how the FOMC assesses progress toward its employment objectives."
2,"First, insofar as recent productivity growth is concerned, I have a serious question about the quality of the data that we employ to measure output in today's economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the quality of productivity growth data, which is a technical observation rather than a direct indication of a future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on data quality reflects the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making but does not in itself reveal a hawkish or dovish inclination."
2,A few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members believe that the labor market can sustain lower unemployment without leading to higher inflation. This suggests that they see room for the labor market to improve without necessitating a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance. They are essentially saying that the economy can handle a lower rate of unemployment without triggering the inflationary pressures that would typically call for a more hawkish approach."
0,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that low inflation leads to lower interest rates, which is generally associated with a more dovish stance. Lower interest rates are a tool used to stimulate economic activity, suggesting an easing of monetary policy to counteract inflation that is below the target level. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it indicates a focus on supporting economic growth and employment rather than on preventing high inflation."
0,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about very low inflation and deflation, which are conditions that typically lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. The FOMC might consider easing policies to prevent deflation and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that aims to stimulate economic activity and move inflation towards the target level."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of various securities to provide support to private credit markets and economic activity. This action is consistent with an easing of monetary policy, as it involves injecting liquidity into the financial system, which is typically done to stimulate the economy during periods of slower growth or economic downturns. The aim of such purchases is often to lower long-term interest rates, encourage borrowing, and support employment and price stability when the economy is underperforming. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is characterized by measures taken to stimulate the economy and is generally associated with a more accommodative monetary policy approach."
0,"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an update on the labor market, indicating a significant recovery of jobs and a decrease in the unemployment rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather reports on the progress towards the goal of maximum employment. The statement is factual and does not imply a clear direction for future policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members gave considerable attention to the somewhat faster increases in broad price measures over the past year, but they differed to some extent regarding the prospects for further increases in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are acknowledging the recent increases in inflation but shows that there is no consensus on the future direction of inflation. This suggests that the Committee is aware of the changes in inflation but is not signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of differing views among members further emphasizes the neutral stance, as it does not commit to a specific policy direction."
2,The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the staff of the FOMC views the recent increases in consumer price inflation, particularly from energy and nonmarket services, as temporary. This implies that the Committee may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as they expect the inflationary pressures to subside on their own. This stance is dovish because it indicates a tolerance for the current inflation levels without signaling a move towards higher interest rates or other contractionary measures."
2,"White-collar, high-skilled employment increased at a much faster rate than employment in the other categories in nearly all cases in the G-7 countries over 1979-95.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical trend in employment distribution among different job categories in G-7 countries over a period from 1979 to 1995. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate actions to be taken by the FOMC regarding tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence is more of an observation of past labor market conditions rather than a directive or reflection of current monetary policy goals."
2,"In Latin America, indicators suggested that economic activity in Mexico and Brazil expanded further in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing an observation of economic conditions in Mexico and Brazil, without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It does not directly relate to the Federal Reserve's mandate of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States, nor does it suggest a particular action such as tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected outcome of currency depreciation on the price of U.S. exports relative to foreign-produced goods, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action by the FOMC regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Instead, it provides an analysis of exchange rate movements and their potential impact on trade, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader assessment of the economy."
0,"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about consumer spending patterns without directly suggesting a need for a change in monetary policy. It indicates that since consumer spending remained strong during the economic downturn, there isn't a backlog of consumer demand that would typically drive a post-recovery spending surge. This assessment does not inherently call for either tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context for understanding the economic situation. It reflects a balanced view that would inform the FOMC's decisions without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"Participants generally agreed that the drag on U. S. economic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign economic growth, particularly in emerging market economies, was likely to continue to depress U. S. net exports for some time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, specifically the impact of a stronger dollar and slower foreign economic growth on U.S. net exports. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather assesses factors that could influence the Committee's policy decisions. The focus is on understanding the economic landscape, which is a neutral stance in terms of policy direction."
0,"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, highlighting the challenges to activity and employment levels. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather sets the stage for understanding the economic context in which the FOMC is operating. The statement is factual and does not suggest a specific policy response, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that the impact of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is uncertain in the medium term. This reflects a balanced view that acknowledges the complexity of economic relationships without suggesting a particular policy action."
2,"The explanations included a decline in inflation risk premiums, possibly reflecting a lower perceived probability of higher inflation outcomes; and special factors, including liquidity risk premiums, that might be influencing the pricing of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation derivatives.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors influencing the pricing of inflation-related securities without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges various elements that might be affecting market perceptions and prices, such as inflation risk premiums and liquidity risk premiums, but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on explaining market conditions rather than signaling a policy stance."
2,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the inherent volatility in inflation measures without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing but rather an acceptance of the fluctuating nature of inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's understanding that economic indicators can be variable."
2,"By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of inflation trends, noting that inflation was receding from its previous year's level and aligning with forecasts. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a context of past inflation performance, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy stance."
0,Participants pointed to potential interactions between financial stresses and the housing market contraction as the primary source of continuing downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for downside risks to economic growth, stemming from financial stresses and a contracting housing market. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support growth and mitigate these risks, aligning with a dovish stance that favors measures to stimulate the economy."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad objectives that guide the Committee's decisions. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to managing the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, specifically the performance of equity prices over a period. This statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should adjust the federal funds rate or alter its monetary policy to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide information on inflation trends or employment levels, which are key considerations for determining the FOMC's policy stance."
0,"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively engaging in providing liquidity to the financial system during times of stress, which is a form of monetary policy intervention typically associated with easing. However, the context of ""what we did today"" suggests that this action has already been taken, implying a response to a specific situation rather than an ongoing or future policy stance. The use of ""our original role"" could be interpreted as a reminder of the Fed's mandate to ensure stability, which can be seen as a commitment to take necessary actions, including tightening if required, to maintain order in the financial system. Without additional context indicating a shift towards easing, the statement can be seen as reaffirming the Fed's readiness to act, which in times of stress could mean either providing liquidity (dovish) or withdrawing it (hawkish) depending on the circumstances. Given the lack of clear direction towards easing, and considering the Fed's overall mandate including stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, the stance is classified as HAWKISH, reflecting a readiness to intervene to prevent financial instability, which could include tightening measures."
2,This information helps Committee members deduce how their own actions and statements are likely to affect asset prices and yields.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process by which FOMC members consider the impact of their actions and statements on financial markets, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of the relationship between policy decisions and market outcomes, which is a fundamental aspect of conducting monetary policy, but it does not suggest any particular policy stance."
2,"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core consumer price indices have not increased significantly over the past year, particularly as measured by the PCE chain-price index, suggesting that inflationary pressures are not a current concern. This lack of significant inflationary pressure implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current monetary policy to encourage economic growth and employment."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of price stability and sustainable growth, which are consistent with its long-term objectives. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather it reaffirms their ongoing commitment to their dual mandate."
1,"These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is operating at or near full employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. When the economy is at full employment, the risk of inflation tends to increase as employers compete for workers, potentially driving up wages and prices. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Therefore, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, indicating a potential tightening of monetary policy to maintain stable prices, another key goal of the FOMC."
0,"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that an increase in productivity is having a disinflationary effect, which could be interpreted as reducing inflationary pressures. However, the statement does not explicitly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather describes an economic condition. It implies that the current state of productivity is helping to keep inflation in check, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC will respond with a change in policy, such as tightening or easing, hence it is considered neutral."
2,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on."" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an observation about market conditions, specifically an increased demand for financial services that help manage risk and provide liquidity. This could be a reflection of economic conditions, but it does not inherently suggest a move towards raising or lowering interest rates or adjusting monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future policy."
2,"In the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), dealers indicated, on net, that they loosened credit terms applicable to several important classes of counterparties and types of collateral over the past three months amid increased demand for funding for most types of securities covered in the survey.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a survey result where dealers reported that they have loosened credit terms and experienced increased demand for funding, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It is more of an observation of market conditions rather than a statement of policy action. The loosening of credit terms could be a response to market dynamics rather than a result of FOMC policy changes. Therefore, without explicit context linking this to a change in monetary policy, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the nature of recessions following asset-price booms and busts, which is more of an analytical or research-oriented question rather than a direct statement on monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of economic conditions and their implications. The FOMC is likely seeking to understand economic patterns to inform future policy decisions, but this sentence alone does not suggest a specific policy direction."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a trend toward disinflation, which is a reduction in the rate of inflation, and it attributes this trend to a potentially large amount of economic slack, meaning underutilized resources in the economy. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that aim to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other measures to increase economic activity. In this context, the mention of disinflation and economic slack could imply that there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or become more so, in order to support the economy and move closer to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with considerable moderation in the growth in M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in the growth of money supply measures M2 and M3, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. A reduction in the growth of the money supply is often associated with efforts to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. By moderating the growth of these aggregates, the FOMC is signaling a more restrictive stance, which is typically considered hawkish."
1,"In addition, the forecast for headline PCE price inflation incorporated a much higher rate of increase for energy prices for the first half of the year; as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation, particularly due to rising energy prices, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract the anticipated increase in inflation and align with its goal of maintaining stable prices around the 2% target. Higher headline inflation, if it persists, could prompt the FOMC to raise interest rates or take other measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that price-level targeting might necessitate a higher short-term inflation rate than what is aimed for in the long term. This suggests a potential need for a tighter monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down economic activity."
1,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflationary pressures arising from sharply rising medical costs and efforts to shield wages from the impact of increasing energy prices. This suggests that there may be upward pressure on overall inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) approach to its price-stability mandate, emphasizing the goal of maintaining inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent, especially when the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound during economic downturns. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the importance of managing inflation expectations within the context of their established long-term inflation goal. It reflects a commitment to the inflation target and acknowledges the challenges in achieving this when conventional monetary policy tools are limited."
1,"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is taking actions to reduce its balance sheet at a faster rate than in the previous cycle, in addition to increasing the policy rate. This combination of reducing the balance sheet (which effectively tightens monetary conditions by reducing the amount of money in the system) and raising interest rates is aimed at reducing demand to match supply. This is a classic example of a tightening monetary policy stance, which is consistent with a hawkish approach, as it seeks to prevent or curb inflation by slowing down economic activity."
1,"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants expect that a tightening (""firming"") of monetary policy will be appropriate to bring inflation back to the Committee's 2 percent target while maintaining a strong labor market. This suggests a bias towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,This linkage establishes one important connection between the FOMC's target funds rate and interest rates more broadly.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of how the Federal Reserve's target for the federal funds rate is connected to broader interest rates. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather explains a mechanism of monetary policy transmission. The statement is factual and does not suggest any imminent policy action, thus it is neutral with respect to the FOMC's stance on monetary policy."
2,"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of balanced-budget requirements at the state level, which is a fiscal policy matter rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an example of how deficit targets can be implemented in fiscal practices."
0,"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a statement about the complexity of productivity growth, which is a factor in the overall economic environment but does not suggest a specific policy action. The sentence does not imply an immediate concern for inflation or employment, which are the primary focuses of the FOMC when considering adjustments to monetary policy."
2,"This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is concerned about volatility that could hinder the effective implementation of monetary policy. By stating that they are addressing this volatility, it implies that they are taking action to stabilize the situation, which could involve tightening monetary policy to achieve their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This action-oriented approach towards mitigating volatility is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it suggests measures that could include raising interest rates or other forms of policy tightening to maintain control over economic fluctuations."
2,"For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing a factual statement about how equities are evaluated in financial markets, specifically mentioning the use of the price-earnings ratio as a standard benchmark for assessing a stock's valuation. It does not directly indicate any stance on monetary policy or suggest any action or outlook related to tightening or easing monetary conditions. It does not reflect on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it imply any adjustments to policy in response to economic conditions."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule, but it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential approach to managing inflation without explicitly indicating a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Flexible inflation averaging is a strategy that could be used to achieve the FOMC's long-term inflation goal of 2%, suggesting a balanced approach to dealing with inflation deviations. It does not directly suggest an immediate policy action but rather discusses a method that could be employed to maintain price stability over time."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of global factors on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as the improved strength and resilience of the financial system due to better risk management and stronger regulation. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions and regulatory improvements. The focus on global factors and the state of the financial system suggests a balanced view without a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are worried about potential inflationary pressures arising from tighter labor markets in the intermediate term. This concern suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an undesirable increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, with the aim of keeping inflation in check."
0,"The unemployment rate declined in May and , 2020 June but, at 11.1 percent, remains far above its level before the outbreak and greater than the Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL peak during the Global Financial Crisis.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate, it remains significantly higher than pre-crisis levels and above the peak during the Global Financial Crisis. This suggests that the labor market is still weak, which would typically lead the FOMC to consider policies that support economic growth and job creation, such as keeping interest rates low or implementing other accommodative measures. The focus on high unemployment aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies a need for easing monetary policy to move towards the goal of maximum employment."
2,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economic problem being discussed is due to factors outside the realm of monetary policy or the response to the pandemic. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a role for monetary policy to play in addressing this particular issue, which neither implies an intention to tighten nor ease the monetary policy. It is a statement of circumstance rather than a policy direction."
2,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the methodology for understanding long-term interest rates and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It explains that forward rates, which are used to gauge future expectations, include considerations for various risks, including inflation, but does not suggest any immediate action by the FOMC. The focus is on the analytical approach rather than policy direction."
1,"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about the perception of oil prices in the 1970s, relating to global demand and supply balances. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on past events that would have influenced economic conditions and policy decisions of that time. The sentence does not provide information on current monetary policy actions or intentions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions and central bank assessments in the United Kingdom rather than directly indicating a change in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It reports on external factors such as gilt yields, currency exchange rates, inflation data, and the Bank of England's assessment, which do not directly reflect the FOMC's policy actions or intentions. While such information might be considered in the FOMC's decision-making process, the sentence itself does not suggest a clear move towards tightening or easing U.S. monetary policy."
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an individual's belief that quantifying the price stability objective aligns with the current dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both price stability and maximum employment. However, it also acknowledges the complexity of communicating this change. The statement does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather discusses a matter of policy communication and transparency. It reflects a balanced view on how the goals of the Federal Reserve can be articulated without suggesting any immediate action to adjust monetary policy."
0,"In addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on the supply side of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment but rather acknowledges potential challenges to the economy. It suggests that there are factors affecting the supply side that could persist, which could mean either inflationary pressures (if supply is constrained) or deflationary pressures (if supply outpaces demand). Without a clear indication of how these supply side effects are expected to influence the overall economic outlook, the stance remains neutral as it does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the uncertainty in determining the exact levels of output and employment that the economy can sustain without leading to inflation or other issues. This reflects a balanced view that is consistent with the FOMC's principle of being informed by a range of indicators and the inherent uncertainties in economic forecasting. It suggests a cautious approach to policy-making, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Other economies, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about the monetary systems in Argentina and Hong Kong, without indicating any particular stance on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. It does not suggest any action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee expressing readiness to adjust policy as necessary to support economic growth and maintain price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a willingness to respond to changing economic conditions to achieve its goals."
0,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some members of the FOMC were in favor of easing monetary policy because they observed contained unit labor costs and inflation expectations, alongside evidence of economic weakness. This stance suggests a move towards stimulating the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The members' preference for easing implies that they prioritize supporting employment and economic activity over concerns about rising inflation, which is consistent with a dovish position."
2,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity likely would start to turn up early in 2002 as inventory liquidation tapered off, and would gather strength only gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a staff forecast predicting an economic recovery beginning in 2002, with a gradual strengthening of economic activity. It does not directly indicate an immediate change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of future economic conditions. The forecast is consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not suggest a specific policy action. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish policy direction."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio. This information is indicative of a strengthening labor market, which is one of the FOMC's goals (maximum employment). However, the sentence does not directly suggest a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides data that the FOMC might use to assess the state of the economy in relation to its employment objectives."
1,"Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic condition, with high consumer sentiment linked to strong employment, income trends, and stock market gains. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of the current economic situation. The statement is balanced and does not indicate a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus were applied to an economy that was recovering quickly, in the presence of supply-side constraints, leading to a vertical supply curve in certain sectors. This suggests that the economy might be overheating due to the combination of aggressive stimulus and rapid recovery, which could lead to inflationary pressures. A vertical supply curve indicates that increases in demand lead to higher prices rather than an increase in supply, which is a classic inflationary scenario. In this context, a ""strong monetary policy"" likely refers to a policy stance that is aimed at containing inflation, which would be consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
2,"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to data-driven decision-making. The projections themselves could lead to either a hawkish or dovish stance, but the sentence does not provide information on the content or implications of these projections."
2,"Sargent, T. ""Discussion of 'Policy Rules for Open Economics' by Lawrence Ball,"" in J.B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided does not contain any direct information about the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. Instead, it appears to be a citation from a discussion or a paper on monetary policy rules within a larger academic work. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into their assessment of the current economic conditions in relation to their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, without additional context, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that the economy is vulnerable to negative shocks, particularly because the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound, which suggests limited room for further monetary easing. This implies a cautious stance that leans towards maintaining or potentially easing monetary policy to support growth, rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach. The focus on downside risks to GDP growth and the mention of the lower bound for the federal funds rate suggest that the FOMC may be more inclined to stimulate the economy if necessary to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific direction on the future of monetary policy but rather emphasizes the individuality of the participants' projections based on their views of what constitutes appropriate policy. It reflects the FOMC's principle of transparency and the acknowledgment that there is a range of views within the Committee. It does not indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that commodity prices have been rising sharply, which could signal increasing inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, rising inflation may prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to stabilize prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the asset purchases are aimed at stimulating the economy and supporting growth and job creation in the near term. This suggests an easing of monetary policy to encourage economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The mention of increases in the federal funds rate target as a future action to reduce accommodation does not change the overall dovish tone, as it is presented as a subsequent step following the stimulative measures."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it describes an economic condition where increased national saving is contributing to economic growth. This statement is more of an observation of economic activity rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustments."
0,"Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid-June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence describes factors that are likely to have a negative impact on economic activity, such as the spread of the coronavirus, the slowing or scaling back of economic reopening, and indicators of economic deceleration. These conditions suggest that the FOMC might lean towards an easing of monetary policy to support the economy and counteract the adverse effects on employment and economic growth, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on mitigating economic slowdowns typically involves measures to increase liquidity and encourage borrowing and investment, which are characteristic of a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to a presentation made by two economists regarding stock market valuation and does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease the monetary policy but rather provides context or background information."
2,"The unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward, and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the labor market can continue to strengthen without causing undue pressure on resources, which suggests that the current state of employment is neither too tight to cause inflation nor too loose to warrant immediate policy action for stimulation. It reflects a balance between the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite a low unemployment rate, there is still perceived slack in the labor market. This implies that the economy might not be overheating and there may be less pressure to raise interest rates to cool down the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports an easing of monetary policy to encourage employment and economic growth."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about higher inflation due to strong increases in energy and other commodity prices, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, even at the potential cost of lower economic growth in the near term. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and a response to higher inflation rates typically involves a hawkish stance."
1,"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation is significantly above the target level, and it emphasizes the importance of returning to the target to achieve the FOMC's mandated goals. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level."
0,"Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) perceives a greater risk of economic weakness than of overheating or inflation. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to ease monetary policy to support economic growth and prevent a downturn, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating the economy over tightening monetary policy to combat inflation."
0,"So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to—to have inflation move down even a little bit more.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects inflation to decrease due to the impact of the coronavirus. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy during the pandemic-induced downturn. Lower inflation typically reduces the urgency for tightening measures, aligning with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It provides information on economic conditions (a widening trade deficit due to falling exports and rising imports) but does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The statement is simply reporting observed economic data, which could have various interpretations for monetary policy depending on the broader economic context."
0,"One participant remarked that, with inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in recent years and market-based measures of inflation compensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push inflation expectations up to levels consistent with the Committee's objective.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that a participant of the FOMC believes that delaying an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate could help in raising inflation expectations to align with the Committee's goal of a 2% inflation rate. This indicates a preference for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to address inflation that has been persistently below the desired level, which is consistent with a dovish approach."
0,"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy due to the absence of increasing inflation pressures. This suggests a stance towards easing, or at least not tightening, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The implication is that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there is no urgency to raise interest rates to curb inflation, which is consistent with a dovish perspective that supports lower interest rates to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that several members of the FOMC are concerned about potential negative risks to economic growth and inflation, which suggests a tendency towards a more cautious or accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy. This dovish stance implies a readiness to ease policy or delay tightening to mitigate the mentioned downside risks."
2,"In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that although forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation, the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while the growth forecasts have reduced the likelihood of rising inflation, the FOMC members still see the risks of inflation as tilted upwards. This suggests that the Committee is concerned about potential inflationary pressures and may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed situation where employment growth is decelerating, but the unemployment rate is not increasing, suggesting a potentially stable labor market. This could be interpreted as neither a strong signal to raise rates (hawkish) nor a clear indication to lower them (dovish), thus it is best classified as neutral."
1,"Looking ahead, however, members reiterated earlier concerns that aggregate demand could continue to grow faster than potential aggregate supply, even under optimistic assumptions regarding future productivity gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that aggregate demand might outpace aggregate supply, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to curb inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down economic growth to a sustainable level."
2,House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation on the housing market, which is one of the many economic indicators the FOMC might consider. The slowing of house price appreciation could be a sign of a cooling economy, but without additional context on the FOMC's interpretation or intended response, the statement itself remains neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
1,"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to preventing inflation, which could undermine economic expansion and efficiency. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating growth."
2,Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are in a state of observation and are not committing to either tightening or easing monetary policy at this time. They are expressing vigilance in monitoring economic conditions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This stance suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed based on incoming data but are not signaling a move in either direction at the moment."
1,"But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual situation regarding the United States' trade deficits and external debt but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It provides context on the economic conditions that might influence the FOMC's decisions but does not suggest a specific policy action. The focus on trade deficits and external debt relates to broader economic considerations rather than the immediate goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about insufficient economic growth to reduce unemployment, suggesting that the FOMC might favor an easing of monetary policy to stimulate growth and improve employment rates. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
0,Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent.7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for high unemployment rates among the lowest-wage workers, which is a sign of economic weakness and slack in the labor market. The mention of widespread vaccinations as a potential catalyst for reviving demand for in-person services suggests that the FOMC is looking forward to an economic improvement that could help reduce this high unemployment rate. This perspective is dovish as it implies a focus on supporting the labor market and potentially maintaining or introducing accommodative monetary policy measures to foster employment growth, especially among lower-wage workers who are experiencing significant unemployment."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a negative impact on real income growth due to higher energy prices, this was counterbalanced by strong wage and salary increases. This suggests a mixed economic situation where there are both inflationary pressures (from energy prices) and signs of a healthy labor market (wage and salary growth). The statement does not clearly lean towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather presents a balanced view of economic conditions."
2,"Market sentiment toward the syndicated leveraged loan market also improved, with the average bid price increasing noticeably and bid-asked spreads narrowing a bit further.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically improvements in the syndicated leveraged loan market, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation of market dynamics. This information might be used to inform FOMC decisions, but in itself, it does not convey a clear policy direction."
2,"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the potential pitfalls of aligning monetary policy too closely with market prices, which can be volatile and influenced by short-term factors. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of not being swayed by market whims. This suggests a commitment to a balanced approach that considers a range of indicators and factors when making policy decisions, in line with the FOMC's principles of aiming for maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The first area is the characterization of good monetary policy in increasingly realistic and complex model environments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the conceptual approach to defining good monetary policy within complex economic models. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Instead, it reflects a general statement about the analytical framework for monetary policy."
2,"After falling steeply before the August FOMC meeting, emerging market equity prices were little changed, on net, over the period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding emerging market equity prices without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It simply states a fact about market conditions and does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The sentence does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a deviation from the targeted 2% inflation rate. It is a neutral observation of market events."
2,You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflective and rhetorical in nature, questioning the necessity of extensive knowledge for successful monetary policymaking. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information about current economic conditions or policy adjustments. It is more about the process and approach to policymaking rather than a comment on the current or future stance of policy."
1,"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite increases in labor compensation, improvements in productivity are offsetting the impact on unit costs, and strong market competition is preventing firms from raising prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current policy to support employment and economic growth without the immediate concern of accelerating inflation."
0,The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of a long-term trend in global financial markets, specifically the decline in global sovereign bond yields, without directly suggesting an immediate action or stance on monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the environment in which monetary policy is being conducted. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a deviation from the 2% inflation target or a shortfall in employment that would necessitate a policy adjustment."
0,Members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about the potential negative economic impacts of very large deficits in the long term. This concern suggests a cautious stance towards expansionary fiscal policy, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such concerns, the FOMC might consider a tighter monetary policy to counteract inflation risks and maintain stable prices, one of their key objectives."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, suggesting a willingness to tighten monetary policy as needed to control inflationary pressures. This stance aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, even in the face of rising demand and limited supply, which could lead to inflation exceeding the target rate. The mention of taking ""whatever steps were needed"" implies a readiness to increase interest rates or employ other contractionary measures to ensure long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
1,"Participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth leading to a decline in unemployment, which aligns with the Committee's objective of maximum employment. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather indicates a steady progress towards the FOMC's employment goals. The use of ""gradual"" implies a measured approach without signaling a strong shift in policy stance."
2,"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes different modeling approaches to economic factors, some of which are directly linked to observable variables like inflation, while others are more abstract statistical representations. It does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy but rather discusses the methodology for understanding economic conditions. This is a technical statement about economic modeling rather than a policy stance."
0,"While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation with both positive and negative elements. The robust demand for residential housing and rising government outlays suggest some economic strength, while the slowdown in consumer spending and sluggish capital spending indicate weaknesses. This balance of positive and negative factors does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL. The FOMC might view this information as part of the broader economic context without it necessarily prompting an immediate policy response."
0,"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of stable inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations, and reduced economic volatility on the attractiveness of longer-maturity obligations. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather comments on the conditions that can make longer-term investments more appealing. These conditions align with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not suggest a change in policy stance."
1,"The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of market conditions where the federal funds rate was higher than anticipated due to a temporary increase in demand for reserves, rather than indicating a deliberate change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It does not explicitly suggest a future direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reports on a past event that affected interest rates. The statement is more about explaining the mechanics behind the rate fluctuation than signaling a policy shift towards achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the importance of projections for public understanding and planning, rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the role of clear communication about short-term shocks versus long-term trends in price stability, which is a key aspect of the FOMC's approach to transparency. There is no direct suggestion of tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an explanation of how the FOMC's projections can aid in distinguishing between temporary fluctuations and sustained inflationary trends."
2,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not anticipate a significant change in inflation, suggesting that they might not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The expectation of ""slight further disinflation"" without a ""material change in inflation"" implies a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance. This reflects a balance between not needing to combat high inflation (which would be hawkish) and not needing to stimulate the economy to prevent deflation (which would be dovish)."
2,It was the year of synchronized global growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It was the year of synchronized global growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a descriptive statement about the state of the global economy, without any explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. It does not provide information on inflation, employment, or interest rates, which are the key factors the FOMC considers when determining its policy stance."
0,Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it is a statement about productivity improvements, which could potentially impact economic growth and inflation but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action. The sentence is more focused on economic observation rather than a clear direction for monetary policy."
1,"However, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern among some FOMC participants that rising oil and commodity prices, along with higher import prices due to a weaker dollar, could lead to increased inflationary pressures. This concern suggests a potential need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
1,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives a greater risk of increased inflation pressures in the near future. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the labor market is performing well, with solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, it does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, as it does not comment on inflation or the need for adjustments to the federal funds rate. It simply states the current status of employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals, without implying any particular policy action."
1,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that high inflation could be more persistent, which implies a risk of inflation exceeding the target level. This concern would typically lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other measures to reduce inflationary pressures, in line with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an observation of economic conditions, specifically unemployment rates, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather reports on employment trends, which is one of the FOMC's key considerations for policy decisions. The statement is descriptive and does not imply any particular action, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"In their discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence in the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, all the members agreed that the latter should continue to express, as it had for every meeting earlier this year, their belief that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that all FOMC members agree that risks are skewed towards rising inflation, which suggests a concern about inflation potentially exceeding their target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent an overheated economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if there is an unexpected sharp increase in wages or inflation, it could be a sign that the economy is reaching a point where it might overheat, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation and maintain stability. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors measures to control inflation, even at the risk of slowing down economic growth."
1,They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members recognize additional inflationary pressures arising from the war and related events, which suggests a concern for rising inflation. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The mention of these pressures also implies that the FOMC might consider actions to prevent inflation from moving further away from their target, which could include raising interest rates or other contractionary measures."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This communication strategy is aimed at influencing the pricing of longer-term interest rates to align with the monetary policy path they deem most likely. Keeping interest rates low is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it indicates a policy geared towards stimulating economic activity, supporting employment, and countering deflationary pressures, rather than combating high inflation or overheating in the economy."
0,"Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of fiscal policy in influencing economic growth through various means such as affecting national saving, incentivizing work, saving, investment, and public investment in human and physical capital. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest changes to the federal funds rate or other monetary tools. Instead, it outlines the potential impacts of fiscal policy, which is separate from the monetary policy actions typically discussed in FOMC statements."
1,"Even as the outlook for real activity has weakened, there have been some important developments on the inflation front.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that despite a weakening in real economic activity, there have been notable changes regarding inflation. This suggests that inflation concerns might be prominent enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of ""important developments on the inflation front"" indicates that inflation could be trending away from the target, potentially requiring a hawkish response to bring it back in line with the Committee's objectives."
2,"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the amount of inflation-protected securities outstanding and the ability to gauge real interest rates across different maturities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a tool for assessing economic conditions. The FOMC uses such data to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic situation where GDP growth variance decreased and inflation rates fell from high levels. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past economic conditions, which could be used to inform current policy but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action."
1,"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's forecast for inflation has been revised upward due to recent data showing faster-than-expected increases in prices, which suggests that the inflation is not entirely temporary. This could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation and bring it back towards the FOMC's target of 2%. A hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and the actions taken to control it, such as raising interest rates."
2,"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of understanding the limitations of price indexes when making policy decisions. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather cautions against potential errors in policy formulation due to imperfect data. The focus is on the accuracy and reliability of economic indicators, which is a prerequisite for informed decision-making, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to data-driven approaches."
2,Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that rising productivity and slack in foreign economies are leading to strong competition, which in turn is suppressing price increases. This suggests that inflationary pressures are low, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this would align with a dovish stance, as there is no immediate need to raise interest rates to combat high inflation."
2,Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of experienced loan officers in effectively distributing loans to stimulate wealth and growth in the local economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it focuses on the qualitative aspect of loan distribution and its potential impact on economic growth, which is more related to banking practices and financial intermediation rather than the FOMC's monetary policy actions."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate during the 1988-90 period, stating that they were not especially surprising or anomalous. This statement does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reflects a retrospective assessment of economic conditions without suggesting any immediate policy action. It is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a need to adjust the monetary stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes the importance of international economic conditions in its decision-making process. It does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC must consider. This reflects a balanced approach, considering both domestic and international factors, without a clear indication of a change in policy stance."
0,"On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years--reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases--could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the implications of an inverted yield curve for future economic activity, considering both the traditional interpretation of an inverted yield curve as a recession risk and the mitigating factor of low term premiums due to central bank asset purchases. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather weighs different economic indicators and their reliability. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexity of economic signals without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers' projections looked very much like most of the public's.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that policymakers' projections on inflation align with public expectations, which does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing. It reflects an acknowledgment of the current state of inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests satisfaction with the current policy framework and does not hint at any immediate changes to the stance of monetary policy."
2,"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing the historical performance of economic indicators during a past recession, specifically how certain indicators signaled the 1990-91 recession. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the reliability of certain indicators in the past, which is part of the FOMC's process of assessing and improving its decision-making tools. This retrospective analysis does not suggest any immediate action towards changing the monetary policy stance."
2,"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and its growth rate over a specific period. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on employment costs, which is one of the factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The stable growth rate of the ECI suggests neither significant inflationary pressure nor deflationary concerns during that period, which would not by itself prompt a change in policy stance."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering innovations and changes to its framework that would support achieving its inflation target more effectively. This suggests a willingness to adapt policy to ensure inflation reaches the desired 2% level, which may involve easing monetary policy if inflation is below target. The use of ""symmetric"" implies that the FOMC is concerned not just with preventing inflation from running too high, but also with avoiding it being persistently below their target, which is a dovish stance."
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the economic situation to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. This reflects a balanced approach, focusing on the assessment of economic conditions to inform policy decisions, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a social and labor market issue regarding the anxiety and insecurity workers feel due to the rapidly changing skill demands of their jobs. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges a nonmonetary factor that could potentially impact employment, which is one of the FOMC's concerns. However, without a clear link to policy actions or intentions to adjust the federal funds rate, the sentence remains neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
1,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.","NEUTRAL

The sentence outlines the Federal Reserve's broad mandates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as financial stability, but does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a general statement of purpose rather than a signal of future policy actions."
2,"Some participants suggested that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the impact of structural factors, including mismatches between the skills of the unemployed and the skills demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a viewpoint on the nature of unemployment, attributing it to structural factors such as skill mismatches, rather than to cyclical or monetary policy-influenced factors. This does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather acknowledges an underlying issue in the labor market that may not be readily addressed through monetary policy alone. It reflects an analysis of the employment situation, one of the FOMC's goals, without a clear indication of a policy stance change."
2,"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to ""look through"" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the considerations that monetary policymakers must take into account when assessing the impact of disasters on the economy. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the need for careful analysis to determine the appropriate response. The focus is on understanding the persistence and breadth of the effects of such shocks to make informed decisions, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed and balanced policy-making."
1,Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that rising inflation could negatively impact the economy over the long term. This concern typically indicates a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent or combat higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish view that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about oil prices rising and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The rise in oil prices could potentially lead to inflationary pressures, but without additional context on the FOMC's response or interpretation, the stance remains unclear."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where technological advances in biotechnology are leading to productivity gains in various sectors, which is generally a positive development for the economy. However, it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. The impact on employment, inflation, and interest rates is not specified, and the sentence does not suggest any immediate action by the FOMC in response to these advances. It is a neutral observation that acknowledges a factor that could influence economic conditions and potentially affect future monetary policy decisions."
0,"In 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States, although there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic conditions of the past year and provides a cautious outlook on future global growth, without directly suggesting an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges external factors that have affected the U.S. economy but also hints at a potential improvement, which does not clearly indicate a move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The focus is on describing the economic environment rather than prescribing a policy response."
2,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's approach to transparency and communication regarding its daily operations and policy decisions, particularly how it manages short-term interest rates. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the Fed's commitment to clear communication with the public and market participants. This approach is intended to prevent misinterpretation and speculation (reading the tea leaves) by ensuring that all stakeholders have access to the same information."
2,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the possibility of adjusting policy to achieve a lower-than-expected increase in unemployment, which suggests a focus on maintaining employment levels. However, it does not clearly indicate whether this adjustment would involve tightening or easing monetary policy. The reference to the unusual ratio of vacancies to unemployed indicates an acknowledgment of atypical labor market conditions, but without a clear direction on policy stance, the sentence is best classified as NEUTRAL. It reflects a consideration of labor market indicators in the context of the FOMC's goals but does not commit to a specific monetary policy action."
1,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."" suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy. It indicates satisfaction with the current state of the economy and a commitment to maintaining this condition using monetary policy tools. The statement does not explicitly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather to continue with the current approach to sustain the economic goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This reflects a neutral stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish policy of tightening or a dovish policy of easing."
1,The first question is whether the degree of easing implemented in response to financial market turbulence and the abrupt downward revision in the forecast should be reassessed in light of the subsequent improvement in financial conditions and the continued robustness of domestic demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a consideration for reassessing the degree of monetary easing due to improved financial conditions and strong domestic demand. This implies that the FOMC might contemplate reducing the level of monetary support (easing), which is consistent with a tightening stance or a move towards less accommodative policy. Tightening monetary policy is often a response to signs of strong demand that could lead to inflationary pressures, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right but also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policy should be adjusted, either tightened or eased, to align aggregate demand with the economy's productive potential. The mention of tightening policy to prevent ""undesirable changes in inflation"" suggests a proactive stance against inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. The focus on preventing inflation implies a readiness to increase interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy if necessary to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
1,Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly in response to signs of rising inflation. This stance aligns with a proactive approach to curbing inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is unable to provide additional monetary easing through its typical method of cutting short-term interest rates. This suggests that the current policy stance is not towards easing, which could be interpreted as a signal of a tighter monetary policy environment or at least the absence of additional easing measures. Given that cutting rates is a dovish action aimed at stimulating the economy, the inability to do so indicates a stance that is not dovish, and in the context of monetary policy where the alternative to easing is either neutral or tightening, this statement leans towards a hawkish interpretation."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of price stability and sustainable growth, which are consistent with its long-term objectives. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms its ongoing commitment to its dual mandate."
2,Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect moderate economic growth in the near term with a gradual pickup later on. This outlook does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, as it portrays a stable economic trajectory. The expectation of moderate growth aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, without signaling significant deviations from the target inflation rate or employment levels that would necessitate a change in policy stance."
2,"However, some others emphasized that deferring the decision until later in the year would permit additional time to assess the outlook for economic activity and inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a preference for delaying monetary policy decisions, which indicates a tendency towards a cautious approach rather than immediate tightening. By waiting for more information on economic activity and inflation, the implication is that there is no urgent need to adjust policy in a restrictive manner, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to stimulate the economy or prevent premature tightening."
0,"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential consequences of setting a strict numerical target for price stability, suggesting that doing so without legislative support could harm the democratic balance and provoke a backlash. This statement does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects on the broader implications of policy decisions and the importance of maintaining a balance between the FOMC's goals and democratic principles. It emphasizes the need for careful consideration in policy-making rather than a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment."
2,"If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation could be expected, but such costs appeared tolerable in light of the employment gains that came with them.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to accept higher inflation as a trade-off for employment gains. This indicates a preference for policies that support employment, even at the risk of exceeding the FOMC's inflation target, which aligns with a dovish stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment over strict inflation control."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general mandate of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which are its core objectives. It does not provide specific information about the direction of policy changes (tightening or easing) or the current economic conditions that would necessitate a change in the monetary policy stance. Instead, it outlines the broad goals of the FOMC, which are consistent with its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, along with moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy without indicating a shift towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that businesses are not passing on the higher costs of labor to consumers, likely due to strong competition, which suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. This implies that there may be less urgency to increase interest rates, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy or maintain current policy settings."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are current imbalances in demand and supply, including labor supply, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without causing persistent inflationary pressure. This indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of the economy and does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but does not currently see the imbalances as a trigger for a change in policy."
2,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are perceived risks to inflation and economic growth, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes that the most probable scenario is one where prices remain stable and growth is sustainable. The Committee's decision to maintain a balanced assessment of risks, assuming appropriate policy actions are taken, suggests that they are neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but are instead aiming to respond to economic conditions as they evolve to maintain their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm"" does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It is a neutral observation that acknowledges a potential long-term economic trend without suggesting a specific monetary policy response. Slower productivity growth could have implications for both inflation and employment, but the sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the FOMC would respond with a hawkish or dovish stance. It merely reflects an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions."
2,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a neutral observation about the volatility of short-term economic indicators, such as gasoline prices, without directly suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges the influence of fluctuating prices on economic indicators but does not indicate a specific policy action or stance in response to these changes."
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a phenomenon that affects the economy, specifically mentioning the movement of asset prices, including equities and residential real estate. It does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges factors that the FOMC monitors in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The movement of asset prices can be a reflection of various economic conditions, but without additional context on whether these movements are seen as positive or negative, or how the FOMC might respond, the stance remains neutral."
2,"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a regional economic observation regarding unemployment rates and migration patterns within South Dakota, specifically between metropolitan and rural areas. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on employment distribution, which is one of the FOMC's considerations for broader economic assessments. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for any particular monetary policy action."
2,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in using different measures of inflation for policy decisions, highlighting a technical consideration rather than indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy but rather points to the complexity of interpreting inflation indicators in the context of monetary policy."
0,"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation concerns have diminished and there is a less positive outlook on near-term economic growth among financial-market participants. This suggests that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for easing to support economic growth, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of economic activity, with household spending growth slowing down but business investment continuing to grow strongly. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it presents a mixed view of the economy. The moderation in household spending could be seen as a sign of potential economic slowing, while strong business investment could indicate underlying economic strength. Since the statement does not clearly lean towards a concern about inflation or employment, it is best classified as neutral."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives, without indicating a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Independence and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, was established as an independent central bank--although, at the time, it was given no clear concept of its role in the conduct of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context about the Federal Reserve's establishment and its independence but does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an intention to raise nor lower interest rates, nor does it comment on current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the transitory nature of inflationary effects from commodity prices or currency value changes and their long-term dissipation, which is contingent on stable public inflation expectations. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a condition under which current fluctuations may not have a lasting impact on inflation. This reflects an understanding of inflation dynamics without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of declining crude oil prices, a temporary and small impact on food prices from a drought, stable long-run inflation expectations, and persistent substantial resource slack. These factors suggest that inflationary pressures are expected to be low, which implies there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The forecast of subdued inflation through 2014 aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests that the FOMC may not need to raise interest rates aggressively to keep inflation in check, and could maintain or even ease monetary policy to support employment without risking their inflation target."
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in focus from concerns about rising inflation to concerns about economic weakness. This suggests that the FOMC is more worried about a potential slowdown in economic activity than about inflation running too high. A stance that emphasizes the risks of economic weakness typically aligns with a dovish monetary policy, which may involve maintaining lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment. The absence of an intermediate balanced risk assessment implies a more decisive move towards a dovish stance, as it skips a neutral position that would suggest equal concern for inflation and economic weakness."
0,"They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflationary pressures are expected to decrease due to a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might not need to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, as the inflation rate is expected to rise more slowly towards the Committee's 2 percent target. The implication is that there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity without risking an overshoot of the inflation target."
0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a slowdown in output and employment, the FOMC expects that with continued policy accommodation (which typically means keeping monetary policy easy), economic activity will grow and labor market conditions will improve. This suggests a stance that is supportive of economic growth and employment, consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy that focuses on stimulating the economy rather than tightening conditions to combat inflation."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that falling oil prices are contributing to lower inflation. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment, as lower inflation gives the central bank more room to maneuver without the immediate need to tighten policy to control inflation."
0,"The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was lower than the staff expected at the time of the November meeting, and the staff forecast anticipated that core PCE prices would rise a bit more slowly in 2011 and 2012 than previously projected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the actual rate of consumer price inflation has been lower than expected, and the staff forecast suggests a slower rise in core PCE prices than previously projected. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not as strong as anticipated, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and help move inflation towards the Committee's 2% target."
2,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a goal of returning the economy to a state of low unemployment and inflation near the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an objective the FOMC would like to achieve. This objective aligns with the dual mandate without indicating a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,"Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure 1 is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line represents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average inflation will be between 2009 and 2014.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a method of interpreting market inflation expectations and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy actions such as tightening or easing. It is simply providing an explanation of how to read a chart that estimates current and future inflation expectations, which is a part of the data the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any particular action or change in policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth and a slow reduction in unemployment, without explicitly indicating a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests a steady approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without signaling immediate concerns that would prompt a change in policy stance."
2,"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the approaches to monetary policymaking, noting a preference for the forecast-based approach over another unspecified method. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the methodology used in policymaking. The focus on forecasting suggests a data-driven approach to policy decisions, which aligns with the FOMC's principles of being informed by a range of indicators and balancing risks. However, without additional context on how this approach impacts policy decisions in terms of being more hawkish or dovish, the sentence itself remains neutral."
0,It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that the unemployment rate is expected to remain higher than the level associated with the Federal Reserve's maximum-employment mandate for an extended period. This suggests that the FOMC may be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job growth and help the economy reach full employment, which aligns with a dovish stance."
0,"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the U.S. economy, noting the transition from recovery to expansion and reflecting on the rapid and robust recovery in GDP. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of past economic performance. The statement is factual and does not suggest any immediate policy actions, thus it is classified as neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle about the relationship between central bank independence and inflation, based on economic literature. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a belief in the benefits of central bank independence for maintaining low inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. However, the sentence does not provide specific guidance on the direction of policy adjustments."
0,"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the appreciation of the dollar has been suppressing inflation by making imports cheaper and reducing the pricing power of domestic firms. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not a current concern, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. Instead, the statement points towards conditions that might warrant a more accommodative stance to support domestic firms and employment, aligning with a dovish policy approach."
2,"For the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, they find heterogeneous views among voters, but no systematic differences based on whether the MPC member is an insider--that is part of the hierarchy at the Bank--or an outsider appointed for a short term just to the MPC; whether the person comes from an academic background; or whether that person has worked at the Treasury.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the diversity of views within the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that differences in opinion are not systematically based on the members' backgrounds or positions. This information does not suggest any particular action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
1,"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that China's fluctuating COVID containment measures, particularly the revival of travel restrictions, could lead to an ""upside risk for inflation."" This implies that there is a risk of higher inflation, which could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, they are still low, and survey-based expectations for long-term inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests that the FOMC sees some signs of inflation but not enough to warrant a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The statement reflects an observation of current conditions without a strong indication of imminent policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It shows the Committee is monitoring inflation indicators, consistent with its mandate for stable prices, but the information provided does not clearly suggest a move away from the current policy stance."
0,"When the government runs deficits, it siphons off private savings (reducing national saving), leaving less available for capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic concept related to government deficits and their impact on private savings and national saving, which in turn affects capital investment. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on fiscal policy and its potential effects on the economy, which is separate from the monetary policy actions that the FOMC might take. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to interest rates or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is a tightening of lending standards and a reduction in debt growth in response to high valuations in commercial real estate. This suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary policy to prevent potential overheating in that sector, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain stable prices."
0,"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable, although market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next five years, as well as over the five-year period beginning five years ahead, moved down further over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. The stability of survey-based measures suggests that long-term expectations are anchored, which is a goal of the FOMC. However, the decline in market-based measures could be seen as a sign of lower expected inflation, which might not necessitate a tightening of policy. Since the sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, it is best classified as neutral."
0,"M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there have been significant increases in the money supply (M2 and M3), which are a result of recent easing actions by the Federal Reserve. These actions have likely been taken to lower market interest rates and influence the flow of funds, which can stimulate economic activity. However, the mention of ""very large gains"" in the money supply could be a concern for inflation. If the Federal Reserve is aiming to prevent inflation from rising above their target, this could signal a need to tighten monetary policy in the future to counteract the inflationary effects of the increased money supply. Therefore, the stance is considered hawkish as it suggests a potential shift towards tightening to maintain price stability."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing unemployment and addressing the negative impacts of long-term joblessness. This suggests a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job creation and economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish stance. The emphasis on bringing people back to work aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, and there is no mention of concerns about inflation that might suggest a need for tightening."
1,"The first round of the three-month U. S. dollar auctions that major foreign central banks announced on September 15 was held in October; demand was quite limited, and only the European Central Bank (ECB) drew on its swap line with the Federal Reserve.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an operational detail of the monetary policy implementation, specifically the usage of swap lines with foreign central banks, which in this case indicates limited demand from these banks. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides information on the functioning of a policy tool. The limited demand suggests that there was no immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to provide substantial liquidity in U.S. dollars to foreign central banks, which could be seen as neither particularly hawkish nor dovish."
2,"On balance, in light of the uncertainties in the outlook and given that a variety of special factors would continue to contain inflation for a time, the Committee could await further developments bearing on the strength of inflationary pressures without incurring a significant risk that disruptive policy actions would be needed later in response to an upturn in inflation and inflation expectations.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC is willing to wait for more information before taking action, indicating a stance that is not in favor of immediate tightening of monetary policy. The mention of ""uncertainties in the outlook"" and ""special factors"" that would ""contain inflation for a time"" implies that the Committee does not see a pressing need to increase interest rates to combat inflation. This approach is consistent with a dovish stance, as it leans towards maintaining or easing current monetary policy rather than tightening it. The Committee's willingness to delay action despite potential future inflationary pressures indicates a prioritization of current economic conditions over preemptive measures, which is characteristic of a dovish policy approach."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a readiness to adjust policy in response to emerging risks but does not specify a direction of adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,But there’s also a role for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But there’s also a role for monetary policy."" is neutral as it does not provide any specific direction on whether the monetary policy should be tightened or eased. It simply acknowledges that monetary policy has a part to play in achieving the Federal Reserve's goals without indicating a preference for a more hawkish or dovish approach."
0,"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a preference for avoiding premature tightening of monetary policy that could hinder economic recovery, based on the belief that current inflation is temporary. This indicates a leaning towards maintaining or easing monetary policy rather than tightening it, in line with a dovish stance that prioritizes supporting employment and recovery over immediate concerns about inflation."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation. This statement is more of an observation on economic behavior and public awareness rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy."
1,"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members observed signs of demand moderation and rising productivity, which were helping to close the gap between aggregate demand and potential supply. This observation was made even before the full effects of previous tightening actions by the Committee had been realized. The mention of ""earlier Committee tightening actions"" and their ""full restraining effects"" suggests that the FOMC had already been engaged in tightening monetary policy to address economic concerns, and the evidence they observed likely reinforced their decision to maintain or possibly continue with a hawkish stance to ensure stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The focus on restraining effects implies a concern with preventing the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
2,Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes a method by which the FOMC might gauge inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. Survey measures of inflation expectations are one of many indicators the FOMC uses to assess economic conditions and guide its policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is neutral with respect to the FOMC's stance on monetary policy."
0,"Financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the Committee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of the FOMC's previous monetary policy easing on emerging market economies and notes a subsequent reversal of financial conditions due to a non-monetary event (Brazil's legislative decision). It does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather reports on the effects of past actions and external factors."
1,"The July-August deficit in U. S. trade in goods and services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance, specifically the deficit in trade of goods and services, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It provides information on economic conditions, which the FOMC might consider in their policy decisions, but does not in itself suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC would consider such data in the context of the overall economic situation when determining the appropriate monetary policy stance to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a willingness to adjust interest rates swiftly in response to changing economic conditions. This suggests a proactive stance on monetary policy, which could include raising rates to counteract inflation or other signs of an overheating economy, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy."
2,"This approach adds to what we have learned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditionsâ€”most notably, long-term sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3 Empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also challenging, as the report readily acknowledges.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the assessment of unconventional policy tools and their impact on various financial conditions, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy. It reflects an analytical perspective on past actions rather than a signal for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration for alternative measures to gauge inflationary pressures beyond the traditional indicator of excess demand. This suggests a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and does not directly imply an immediate intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a readiness to adapt to new information and methods for achieving the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
2,"Inflation-targeting regimes make sense only if the central bank has independent control of the instruments of monetary policy, as holding the central bank responsible for meeting its inflation target is hardly possible otherwise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a general principle of monetary policy regarding the conditions under which inflation-targeting regimes are effective, specifically the need for central bank independence in policy instrument control. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information on the current economic conditions or the direction of future policy. It is a statement of theory rather than an indication of policy action."
2,"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of temporary disruptions due to Year 2000 problems (often referred to as the Y2K issue), but it also suggests that these effects will be quickly reversed. This statement does not directly imply an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, because the disruptions are expected to be short-lived and not have a lasting impact on the economy. It reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as the FOMC would likely monitor the situation before making any policy adjustments."
0,But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in economic growth, which in itself does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions that could potentially lead to a future policy decision, but it does not convey a clear stance on the direction of that policy. The FOMC might consider such information to adjust policy in either direction to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices, depending on the context and associated economic indicators."
2,"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and declines in government employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a solid increase in employment, particularly in the private sector, which suggests a strengthening labor market. A strong labor market could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could signal a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"In that regard, the prospective strength of demand pressures and related outlook for productivity were subject to a wide range of uncertainty, and there were reasons to believe that economic growth could well slow without any adjustment to policy.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is uncertainty about demand pressures and productivity, with an implication that economic growth might slow down even without any policy changes. This indicates a concern for potential economic weakening, which could lead to a more accommodative policy stance to support growth, aligning with a dovish approach."
1,They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite additional tightening measures, the FOMC members still see a predominant risk of increasing inflationary pressures. This suggests a stance that is inclined towards further tightening of monetary policy to counteract inflation, which aligns with a hawkish viewpoint."
2,"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run above the 2% target temporarily to achieve the long-term average of 2%. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy, or at least not tightening it, in order to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the desired level. It reflects a dovish approach to monetary policy, prioritizing the goal of lifting inflation to the target rate over immediate concerns about potential overheating or the need to tighten policy."
2,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical aspect of economic measurement, specifically the challenge of separating changes in nominal values into real quantities and prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the complexity of defining a consistent unit of output for economic analysis, which is a neutral concept in terms of monetary policy direction."
0,"Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC participants that the longer-run normal federal funds rate is expected to be lower due to long-term secular trends affecting real interest rates. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment of the economic environment and its implications for future policy. It acknowledges structural changes in the economy that may influence the neutral rate of interest, which is the rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. This understanding is important for setting policy that achieves the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not indicate a clear direction for policy change."
2,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the FOMC's process of reviewing and potentially updating its monetary policy framework in response to economic developments. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a commitment to adapt and improve policy tools to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The focus is on learning from past experiences and preparing for future challenges, which is a neutral stance in terms of immediate policy direction."
1,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of the inflation targeting framework without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It simply states that the policy of averaging inflation does not specify the acceptable bounds or duration of inflation above the 2% target. This reflects a neutral stance as it neither suggests an imminent policy action to tighten nor to ease monetary policy but rather comments on the flexibility of the framework."
0,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is expected to move towards full utilization of its resources without causing a rise in inflation. This suggests that there is room for the economy to grow without the immediate risk of overheating, which could mean that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The use of the word ""gradually"" also indicates a more patient approach, consistent with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
2,It also affects stock prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It also affects stock prices"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy (tightening or easing) or the Federal Reserve's stance on economic conditions. It is a neutral statement that simply acknowledges the impact of monetary policy on stock prices without indicating whether the policy is intended to be more hawkish or dovish. It does not directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any particular action or outlook on the part of the FOMC."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a wait-and-see approach, emphasizing the importance of incoming economic data before deciding on any changes to the monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy without further evidence, reflecting a neutral position. The FOMC is expressing a readiness to adjust policy in response to new information, which is consistent with a data-dependent and flexible approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"It is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the limitations of macroeconomic policy in generating growth, acknowledging that while it can help create favorable conditions, it is not the sole driver of growth. This statement does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a general principle regarding the role of policy in the economy. It aligns with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and understanding the influence of nonmonetary factors on the economy."
2,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the rationale behind the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both inflation and output considerations. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather explains the balance the FOMC seeks to achieve between inflation and output. The mention of ""flexible inflation targeters"" suggests that the FOMC's approach is similar to other central banks that adjust their policy in response to economic conditions, which is consistent with a neutral stance that is adaptive to changing economic indicators."
0,"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that increasing aggregate demand could prevent a rise in structural unemployment, which is associated with long-term joblessness. This implies a stance in favor of stimulating the economy, potentially through easier monetary policy, to boost demand and prevent an increase in structural unemployment. Such a stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which tends to support lower interest rates and other expansionary measures to promote employment."
2,"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it offers to provide insight into the FOMC's operations and the effects of monetary policy, which is an educational or informative statement rather than one that signals a specific policy direction."
2,"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is a weakening in the expansion of expenditures in capital goods, possibly due to an excess in capacity after a period of significant growth in certain industries. This observation is a neutral statement regarding monetary policy as it does not directly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy. It is merely an assessment of economic conditions, particularly in the capital goods sector, and does not indicate a clear direction for policy action in terms of adjusting interest rates or altering the monetary base. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
1,"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a view that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect a tightening labor market, suggesting that the observed decrease in unemployment might not lead to inflationary pressures due to a lack of increased labor market tightness. This view neither clearly supports the need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, as it suggests uncertainty about the implications of the current unemployment rate for inflation and monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to interpreting labor market indicators, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between stock prices and home sales, noting their correlation and the influence of interest rates on both. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how certain economic indicators might interact with each other, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC would consider when making policy decisions."
2,"The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the broad set of factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and does not suggest an imminent move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The inclusion of various factors such as public health, labor market conditions, and inflation expectations indicates a comprehensive and measured approach to policy assessment, in line with the FOMC's commitment to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Members noted that most broad measures of inflation moved together over extended periods of time, but they did not always do so over short intervals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the behavior of inflation measures over different time periods without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the complexity of inflation dynamics, which is consistent with a balanced approach to policy-making."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a change in market perception. The sentence itself does not provide information on the direction of the policy shift, whether it is towards a more hawkish or dovish stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,But is it really true that prices are more responsive to productivity than wages?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the relationship between productivity and prices compared to wages, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening nor easing of policy but rather reflects a consideration of economic factors that could influence the FOMC's future decisions."
2,Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent"" does not explicitly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the current rate of wage inflation, which is aligned with the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2%. Without additional context suggesting concern or satisfaction with this rate, or its implications for future policy actions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve intends to slow the pace of asset purchases as reserves reach levels they consider sufficiently ample. This suggests a move towards tightening monetary policy, as reducing the pace of asset purchases would likely lead to less liquidity in the financial system, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The action aligns with the goal of preventing an overheating economy that could lead to inflation exceeding the FOMC's 2% target."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where interest rates are rising quickly, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The concern about not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve is anticipating the consequences of its actions on its finances and potential political repercussions, which could occur in a context where the Fed is actively trying to combat inflation or overheating in the economy. This proactive stance on adjusting interest rates to influence economic conditions aligns with a hawkish policy approach."
2,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a view that, despite increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, the expected stimulative effect on the economy or prices might be limited due to an impaired bank intermediation mechanism and banks' reluctance to lend. This suggests that the current monetary policy adjustments may not have the intended impact on economic activity or inflation, but it does not directly suggest a need to either tighten or ease the policy. It reflects an analysis of the situation rather than a clear direction for future policy changes."
2,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC expects structural productivity gains to prevent significant increases in unit labor costs, which could contribute to inflationary pressures. This outlook implies that the FOMC may not see a need to ease monetary policy to stimulate the economy, as productivity gains could support economic growth without leading to inflation. The anticipation of productivity helping to contain costs aligns with a stance that does not favor additional monetary easing, which is typically considered hawkish, as it suggests vigilance against inflation without the need for policy intervention to stimulate employment."
0,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy is aimed at supporting household spending and home buying, which suggests an accommodative stance to keep the labor market strong, workers' incomes rising, and consumer confidence high. This approach is consistent with a dovish policy that focuses on stimulating economic activity and employment rather than tightening to combat inflation."
1,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the American economy is robust enough to withstand the effects of a tightening monetary policy, which typically includes raising interest rates to control inflation. This implies that the FOMC may be inclined to increase interest rates or reduce monetary accommodation to ensure price stability, one of its key goals, even if it could potentially slow down economic activity. The statement reflects a readiness to prioritize inflation control over further stimulating an already strong economy, which is a hawkish stance."
0,"Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the factors contributing to productivity growth in the United States, namely an investment boom and a technological revolution. It does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific guidance on the direction of interest rates or other monetary tools. Instead, it reflects an analysis of past economic conditions without a clear implication for immediate monetary policy actions."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted in part by favorable earnings reports from the retail sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding stock price indexes and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply states that stock prices have risen, partly due to positive earnings reports from the retail sector, which is a reflection of economic conditions rather than a signal of the FOMC's intentions to tighten or ease monetary policy. This information might be used to inform the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes uncertainty among firms regarding government contracts and how this affects their employment decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the consideration of economic conditions and uncertainties that could impact employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. However, without a clear indication of how this uncertainty might influence the FOMC's policy decisions (e.g., whether it would lead to a change in the federal funds rate), the stance remains neutral."
0,"Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants see underutilization in the labor market, particularly noting the high number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time work. This view implies that the economy is not at risk of overheating and that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative to support further improvements in employment without risking a surge in inflation. This dovish stance would be in line with easing policy to stimulate the economy and move towards the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
1,"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential inflation pressures arising from a declining dollar. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance. Although it acknowledges that past effects on core consumer prices have been limited, the mention of inflation pressures points towards a focus on price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the historical composition of America's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on the nature of economic growth, which could be used to inform policy decisions."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation potentially exceeding the 2% target by a significant margin (at or above 3%). The speaker is suggesting that such an overshoot would not be considered ""moderate"" and, by implication, could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target. This stance is consistent with a hawkish view, which prioritizes controlling inflation even if it means raising interest rates."
1,"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes strong demand and a tight labor market as contributing factors to inflation pressures. The mention of removing ""extraordinary monetary policy accommodation"" suggests that the FOMC is considering tightening monetary policy to address these inflationary concerns. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy and bring inflation back towards the target level."
2,"Scholars disagree somewhat about the extent to which policymakers of the time tried actively to take advantage of this supposed tradeoff, but these ideas likely provided part of the intellectual rationale that made the authorities willing to allow inflation to rise throughout the 1960s and in the early 1970s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reflection on past policymakers' attitudes towards inflation and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It discusses the intellectual rationale behind past decisions to tolerate higher inflation, which is neither an indication of a current tightening nor easing of policy. The sentence does not provide information on the current goals of maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any immediate policy actions."
0,"The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors contributing to the growth in M2 (a measure of the money supply), including temporary effects from mortgage refinancing and increases in nominal income. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of economic activity that could be relevant for future policy decisions. The mention of ""strong gains in nominal income"" could be seen as a sign of economic strength, while the impact of mortgage refinancing on liquid deposits is described as a temporary effect, suggesting that it may not have a lasting impact on monetary policy. Overall, the sentence does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance but rather provides context for the economic environment in which the FOMC is operating."
2,"In keeping with its usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a standard procedural action by the FOMC to review its policy ranges in response to economic and financial developments. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a data-dependent approach that could lead to adjustments based on the observed economic conditions. The mention of reviewing policy in light of growth, velocity behavior of the aggregates, and ongoing developments reflects a balanced stance that is open to changes as necessary to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of unemployment insurance benefits on the labor market and acknowledges the uncertainty of this impact. It also notes the temporal aspect of these benefits, which are set to expire. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation on a factor that could influence the labor market and, by extension, monetary policy decisions. The focus is on the expected change in a nonmonetary factor (unemployment insurance benefits) and its uncertain effect on employment, without a direct link to immediate policy action."
2,"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of housing price trends in various economies and how central banks have responded with attention to asset prices. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve itself. Instead, it reflects on the actions of other central banks and the outcomes in their respective housing markets, without suggesting a specific policy action or change in stance by the FOMC."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of how past changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar are likely to affect the demand for U.S. exports and the substitution of imports for domestic products. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses the economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus is on the impact of exchange rates on trade balance rather than on immediate policy actions to achieve employment or inflation targets."
1,"As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Reserve's commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, which are its core objectives. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reaffirms the goals that guide the FOMC's actions. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant decrease in core consumer price inflation, which suggests that inflationary pressures are diminishing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for easing to support economic activity, given that inflation is moving away from the FOMC's target. The statement is dovish as it points to a potential easing of policy in response to lower inflation."
1,"As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising interest rates, suggesting a tightening of monetary policy to manage economic growth and inflation pressures. The reference to a median rate rising to 3 percent by the end of 2018, approaching what is considered a ""longer-run normal level,"" implies a move towards a less accommodative stance, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy approach. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, as higher interest rates can help to temper inflationary pressures."
2,That is a positive for growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That is a positive for growth"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states that something (unspecified in the sentence) is beneficial for economic growth. Without context on what is causing the growth or how it relates to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, it is not possible to determine whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral."
2,"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a return to previous conditions with retail energy prices decreasing after a temporary post-hurricane increase and consumer confidence recovering. This suggests a normalization of the economic situation without implying a clear need for a change in monetary policy stance. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy, but rather an observation of economic events that are expected to self-correct."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the equilibrium real rate in the context of long-term economic balance, considering factors like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate a current or future change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides a framework for understanding how the FOMC might think about setting policy in relation to long-term economic trends. The focus on the equilibrium rate is about gauging the appropriate level of interest rates for a balanced economy over the long run, which is a neutral concept in itself without an immediate policy implication."
1,"In addition, the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of November showed that interest rates on C&I loans were generally little changed while spreads remained extremely wide.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of interest rates and spreads for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy changes. It simply reports observed conditions in the lending market, which does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy. The mention of ""little changed"" interest rates and ""extremely wide"" spreads does not inherently signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance but rather provides an update on market conditions."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth, with an increase in private domestic final purchases and a turnaround in inventory investment, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy. It simply provides an economic forecast without suggesting whether the FOMC will respond with tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's balancing act between fostering economic growth and preventing inflation, without indicating a current direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It outlines the dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, which is a central goal of the FOMC. The statement reflects a general principle of monetary policy rather than a specific policy stance."
1,"This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee's reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to its inflation target, indicating that the Committee aims for symmetry around the 2 percent goal, neither favoring a tighter policy (which would be hawkish) nor an easier one (which would be dovish). It suggests that the FOMC does not strictly view the 2 percent inflation target as a ceiling but rather as a central point around which inflation can fluctuate. This reflects a balanced stance that accommodates both upward and downward deviations from the target in response to economic conditions."
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential negative economic developments and acknowledges that current monetary and fiscal policies may not be adequately prepared to counter significant adverse shocks. The mention of increased downside risks and uncertainty about global economic prospects, as well as financial market turbulence, suggests a cautious or dovish stance, as it implies that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support the economy in the face of these risks. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goals of fostering maximum employment and stable prices, as easing policy could help mitigate the impact of negative shocks on these objectives."
2,Price shocks.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Price shocks"" by itself does not provide enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It is a neutral term that could be associated with either inflationary pressures (which might suggest a hawkish response) or deflationary pressures (which might suggest a dovish response). Without additional context on the nature of the price shocks, their impact on the economy, or the FOMC's intended response, the stance cannot be determined. Price shocks could lead to a policy adjustment if they affect the inflation rate or employment levels, but this sentence alone does not indicate a direction for policy change."
0,Some participants noted that additional asset purchases could be used to provide more accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants are considering the use of additional asset purchases to lower longer-term interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy easing. This action would be taken to provide more economic accommodation, typically in response to slower economic growth or lower than desired inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the macroeconomic data has been stronger than expected, with a significant rebound in GDP growth. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures if not addressed by tightening monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such data as a reason to increase interest rates or take other actions to prevent the economy from overheating, in line with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target."
2,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a belief in the compatibility of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate goals—full employment and price stability—over the long term. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather affirms a guiding principle that the two objectives can be achieved simultaneously without conflict in the long run. This reflects a balanced view that does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provided does not contain any specific information about the direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. It merely introduces a topic of discussion (exchange rates) without indicating a stance on monetary policy actions or objectives. Therefore, it is classified as neutral."
1,A few participants argued that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run would erode the stability of inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants are concerned that a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy could lead to instability in inflation expectations. This implies a belief that there may be a need to tighten monetary policy to prevent such instability and maintain the FOMC's goal of stable prices, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in July.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is below the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and it could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and help drive inflation towards the target level."
0,Those participants saw substantial slack in resource utilization and hence continued to judge that inflation was likely to remain subdued over the medium term as the economy continued to recover.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe there is considerable slack in the economy, meaning that resources such as labor and capital are not being fully utilized. This underutilization suggests that there is less risk of inflationary pressures building up in the near term. Therefore, the participants expect inflation to stay low as the economy recovers, which implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which would support maintaining or introducing more accommodative monetary policy measures to help the economy reach full employment and to ensure that inflation moves towards the Committee's long-term target."
2,"Generally speaking, the growth of profits and the related buildup of cash have been broadly distributed across industries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the growth of profits and cash accumulation across industries, which does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need for easing (which would be dovish). Instead, it provides a neutral economic assessment that could be part of the broader analysis the FOMC uses to inform its policy decisions."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation regarding the U.S. trade deficit without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It neither indicates an immediate concern for inflation that would warrant a tightening of policy (hawkish) nor does it suggest economic weakness that would require an easing of policy (dovish). Instead, it provides an update on trade balances, which is just one of many economic indicators the FOMC considers when evaluating the overall economic situation."
1,"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about high inflation levels and acknowledges uncertainty about the inflation outlook. This suggests a stance that would favor tightening monetary policy to bring inflation down towards the FOMC's target, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to reduce inflationary pressures."
0,"For example, the unemployment rate has risen by 0.3 percentage points since March, and new claims for unemployment insurance have moved somewhat higher.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a slight increase in the unemployment rate and a rise in new claims for unemployment insurance, which suggests a potential weakening in the labor market. This could imply that there is less pressure on the economy to overheat and therefore less immediate need for tightening monetary policy. The FOMC may consider these signs as a reason to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment, aligning with their goal of maximum employment."
1,"For example, in his monetary policy testimony of July 1992, Chairman Greenspan said, ""As I have often noted to this committee, the most important contribution the Federal Reserve can make to encouraging the highest sustainable growth the U.S. economy can deliver over time is to provide a backdrop of reasonably stable prices on average for business and household decisionmaking"" (Greenspan, 1992, pp.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a general principle of monetary policy rather than a specific policy stance. Chairman Greenspan is emphasizing the importance of price stability for sustainable economic growth, which is a core objective of the Federal Reserve. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather underscores the role of the Federal Reserve in creating a stable economic environment. Price stability is a precondition for the Fed's other goals, and maintaining it can be consistent with either a hawkish or dovish stance, depending on the economic context."
2,"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of policymakers updating their estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the output gap, which are key indicators used to assess the state of the economy. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather focuses on the need for informed decision-making based on economic data. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to making data-driven policy decisions to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the current unemployment rate and its historical context, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather provides an update on one aspect of the labor market, which is one of the FOMC's key areas of focus."
0,A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence explains a technical reason for expected changes in inflation readings due to the base effects from the previous year's low inflation numbers. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context for interpreting upcoming inflation data. The FOMC might use this understanding to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy action."
1,"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general characteristic of inflation's response to shocks and outlines potential strategies for inflation targeters without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not commit to a tightening or easing stance but rather acknowledges the possible approaches in response to economic shocks."
0,"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC is concerned with inflation running below their 2 percent target and is willing to take action to drive inflation towards that goal. This implies a readiness to implement policies that would increase inflation, which typically involves lowering interest rates or other expansionary measures. The focus on achieving inflation outcomes that align with their long-term goal reflects a dovish approach, as it emphasizes the need to stimulate the economy to raise inflation to the desired level."
2,"Median inflation in the nine countries likewise declined, averaging 9-1/2 percent in 1995-99 and 5 percent in 2000-04.Return to text 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical data on inflation rates in nine countries, showing a decline over time. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it presents factual information about past inflation trends, which could be used to inform policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
0,"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while there is some growth in household spending, it is limited by several factors including high unemployment and modest income growth. This suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so in order to support employment and economic growth, in line with the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of ""tight credit"" also implies that there could be a need for easing to improve credit conditions."
2,"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process and the level of information sharing among the members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) before policy meetings, particularly those preceding an Inflation Report. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the thoroughness and consistency of the information that informs their decisions. This process-oriented statement reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not provide insight into the direction of policy adjustments."
1,And inflation is well above target.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""And inflation is well above target"" indicates that inflation rates are exceeding the FOMC's target, which is typically 2% over the long term. A higher inflation rate would generally prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the target level. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to reduce the money supply and cool down the economy. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth."
0,"Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where employment figures have decreased due to temporary and external factors (bad weather and hurricanes). This does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance, as the employment changes are attributed to one-off events rather than underlying economic conditions. The FOMC is likely to view such disruptions as transitory and not reflective of long-term trends that would necessitate a policy adjustment."
1,"The pace of inventory liquidation was thought likely to moderate in coming quarters and subsequently turn to accumulation as inventories came into better balance with sales, with increasingly positive implications for overall production and economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about inventory management and its potential impact on production and economic activity, without directly suggesting an imminent change in monetary policy. It indicates a forecast of economic conditions rather than a clear stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about the economic outlook and does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustments."
0,"In these circumstances, inflation pressures could be expected to remain subdued and some further disinflation might well occur.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not only expected to remain low but could potentially decrease further (""some further disinflation might well occur""). This indicates that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which typically leads to a more accommodative or easing monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment. The lack of inflationary pressure aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation."
0,"And you know, we haven’t yet—we just touched 2 percent core inflation, to pick one measure—just touched it for a few months, and then we’ve fallen back.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the core inflation rate has only briefly reached the target level of 2% before falling back, suggesting that inflation is not currently a pressing concern. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy, as the primary inflation target has not been consistently exceeded. The FOMC may therefore be more inclined to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, rather than to increase interest rates to combat high inflation."
0,"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about a potential slowdown in economic activity due to a correction in equity prices, which could lead to reduced consumer spending and lower investment in business and residential construction. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy that could lead to inflationary pressures, aligning with their goal of stable prices. The mention of a ""correction"" implies that the equity prices were previously inflated, and the adjustment could be a sign of the economy responding to earlier monetary policy actions or expectations of future actions."
2,"In contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the Desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of how the Federal Reserve's trading desk (the Desk) conducts open-market operations, specifically the use of repurchase agreements (repos) to manage temporary variations in the demand for reserves or changes in reserve supply. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a method of operational implementation to maintain the desired level of reserves in the banking system. This is a standard tool used to manage liquidity and does not inherently signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
1,"Most participants remarked that the standard of ""substantial further progress"" had been met with regard to the Committee's price-stability goal or that it was likely to be met soon.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants believe the Committee's goal of price stability has been achieved or is close to being achieved. This suggests that the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Achieving the price stability goal implies that the FOMC might raise interest rates or take other actions to ensure that inflation remains around their 2% target."
2,The fundamental price of an asset typically is defined in terms of the discounted present value of the income stream or equivalent services that the asset is expected to provide over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical description of how the fundamental price of an asset is determined and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather explains a concept related to financial valuation."
2,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a slight increase in the consumer price index (CPI) due to energy prices, the core CPI inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—remained low. This suggests that the overall inflationary pressures are not broad-based and that the situation may not warrant a significant change in monetary policy. The statement acknowledges a specific increase in inflation but also points out that the underlying inflation remains contained, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about economic growth expectations rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic growth. The growth rate mentioned is relatively healthy and could be consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, depending on the context of the growth (such as whether it is demand-driven or accompanied by inflationary pressures). Without additional context indicating how this growth rate would affect the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of continued economic growth through increases in employment and income, which should support consumer spending. It does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic conditions related to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The statement is balanced and does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,There was a lot of pent-up demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""There was a lot of pent-up demand"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states a condition of the economy where demand may have been suppressed and is now being released, which could potentially lead to higher inflation or economic growth. However, without additional context on how this demand is affecting inflation or employment, it is not clear whether this would lead to a hawkish or dovish response from the FOMC. Therefore, the statement is classified as neutral."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals, and therefore there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to support further improvements in employment without risking the goal of stable prices. The focus on underutilization aligns with a dovish stance, which would favor easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and employment."
2,"And we’ve seen significant outflows of capital from those countries, pressures on their exchange rates, and concerns about their performance going forward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of economic conditions, specifically capital outflows, exchange rate pressures, and concerns about future performance in certain countries. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring international developments that could impact the U.S. economy and its monetary policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the policy in response to these observations."
0,"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members are looking for further improvement in the labor market before considering a reduction in the pace of asset purchases. Asset purchases are typically used to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest rates, supporting more borrowing and spending. The fact that they are not ready to slow these purchases indicates a stance towards easing, or at least maintaining an accommodative monetary policy until the labor market conditions improve further, aligning with their goal of maximum employment."
0,"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the potential broad economic impact of policy actions targeted at a specific sector, suggesting a cautious and balanced approach to policy implementation. This reflects an understanding of the interconnectedness of economic sectors and the potential unintended consequences of targeting a single sector, which aligns with a neutral stance that neither commits to tightening nor easing."
2,"That apparently has not made its way into prices yet, but how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?","HAWKISH

The sentence implies concern about potential inflationary pressures that have not yet manifested in prices. The question ""how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?"" suggests that there is an expectation that these pressures will eventually lead to higher inflation. This anticipation of future inflation could indicate a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent such an outcome, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to inflationary pressures to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
1,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that rising employment and incomes are leading to solid growth in consumer spending, which is further supported by increases in household wealth due to rising stock market and home prices. This scenario suggests a strong economy with potential inflationary pressures due to increased consumer spending and wealth, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The focus on solid growth and wealth appreciation aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may need to raise interest rates to achieve its goal of stable prices."
2,The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors (the fiscal situation in some European nations) are affecting global economic growth and financial stability, leading to ""flight-to-quality"" flows, which typically means investors are moving towards safer assets. This observation does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC but rather acknowledges external economic conditions that could impact the U.S. economy and thus the considerations of the FOMC. It reflects the Committee's awareness of international developments that could influence their policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a specific policy action."
2,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation with conflicting economic signals: strong private domestic demand, which could suggest a robust economy, and an external drag from an international crisis, which could imply potential economic challenges or slowdown. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC must consider. The ""tug of war"" suggests that the FOMC is monitoring both positive and negative factors, which could balance each other out, leading to a neutral policy stance until clearer trends emerge."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that economic activity is stronger than expected and that inflation pressures may be increasing. This indicates a potential need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the financial system, which would be consistent with a hawkish approach to address rising inflation and robust economic activity."
0,"So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant increase in the U-6 level of unemployment, which is a broader measure of labor underutilization that includes those who are underemployed and marginally attached to the labor force, in addition to the unemployed. A tripling of the U-6 rate suggests a severe deterioration in employment conditions. In the context of the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, this could signal a need for a more aggressive monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment. However, without additional context on inflation and other economic indicators, the stance could also be interpreted as NEUTRAL, as the FOMC might be waiting for more information before deciding on a policy action. But given the dramatic increase in unemployment described, the initial inclination is toward a HAWKISH interpretation, as it implies a potential readiness to introduce measures to support job growth and economic recovery."
1,"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation expectations to ensure they do not become unanchored, which suggests a concern for rising inflation. By emphasizing the importance of keeping inflation expectations in check, the FOMC is signaling its readiness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to prevent inflation from escalating, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In addition, some policymakers observed that the timing and magnitude of future policy adjustments would ultimately be determined by the Committee's interpretation of the incoming data on the economy and prices rather than by its current expectation of those developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that future policy adjustments will be data-dependent, reflecting a flexible approach that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the economic indicators. This stance does not commit to a specific direction (hawkish or dovish) but rather emphasizes the Committee's responsiveness to new information."
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a specific policy target rather than indicating a change in policy stance. It states the FOMC's long-term inflation target, which is a neutral policy position that provides a benchmark for evaluating performance and guiding decisions. This target is part of the framework for achieving stable prices, one of the FOMC's main goals, but does not in itself signal an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,A number of participants indicated that the Committee should resume asset purchases only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants would consider resuming asset purchases only in the event of significantly adverse economic conditions that require more accommodation than can be achieved by merely lowering the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. This implies a preference for not engaging in additional monetary easing unless absolutely necessary, which is indicative of a hawkish stance that favors tighter monetary policy to prevent potential inflation or financial instability that could arise from excessive accommodation."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a slight downward revision in the economic growth forecast, particularly in the construction sector, but does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in response to those conditions."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perspective on the unemployment rate is one of equilibrium, with no particular skew towards either an overly tight or overly loose labor market. This suggests that the current policy stance is neither particularly geared towards tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish), but rather is maintaining a steady course aimed at preserving balance in the labor market."
2,"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of current spending on equipment and software, attributing it mainly to replacement demand rather than investment that would increase the capital stock (capital deepening). This observation does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that provides an assessment of the investment environment without suggesting imminent changes to monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about the price of oil and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy. The information could be used to assess inflationary pressures or economic conditions, but the sentence itself does not reveal how the FOMC might respond to these conditions."
1,"However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social-distancing concerns and spurring economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that participants expect inflationary pressures to decrease as the economy recovers with the distribution of vaccines, which implies that there may be less need for accommodative monetary policy measures in the future. This anticipation of reduced inflationary pressures and increased economic activity could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,He was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly due to falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about a flattening yield curve, which could be interpreted as a sign of potential economic slowdown or lower inflation expectations. The concern about falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest suggests that the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling below its target level. Tightening monetary policy in response to lower inflation expectations is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to maintain the inflation target and prevent an economic downturn."
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a consideration of the impact of longer-term interest rates on economic conditions, suggesting that the FOMC's future actions would depend on how these rates evolve. It shows that the Committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to adjust its policy stance in response to the effects of interest rate changes on the economy, which aligns with its mandate to maintain stable prices and maximum employment."
2,"Monetary Policy Spillovers Flow in Both Directions There is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging markets (EMs).","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of monetary policy without indicating a current or future direction of policy change. It simply acknowledges the impact of U.S. monetary policy on international markets, which is a factual statement rather than a signal of a hawkish or dovish stance. The sentence does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of employment, inflation, or interest rates, nor does it suggest any particular policy action."
1,"Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if aggregate demand growth is not curtailed, inflation is expected to increase. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to reduce demand growth and prevent a rise in inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on controlling inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down the economy."
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects the current accommodative (easing) monetary policy to contribute to a moderate economic recovery and a gradual decline in unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC is maintaining an easing stance to support economic growth and employment, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The use of the term ""accommodative"" specifically refers to policies that are designed to stimulate the economy, typically by lowering interest rates or through other measures that make money more accessible to businesses and consumers."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the role of inflation in driving financial innovations in Brazil, which helped firms and households economize on cash balances. It does not directly indicate a current stance on U.S. monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide clear guidance on future policy actions by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it reflects on the consequences of inflation in another country's context, which may be part of a broader discussion on economic phenomena but does not signal a specific policy direction for the Federal Reserve."
1,Money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening).,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, which usually happens when there is a tightening of monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The reference to policy tightening suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary stance, which is considered hawkish."
2,"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the relationship between equity price movements and investment spending, which is more of an analytical question rather than a direct statement on monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of economic factors that could influence policy decisions."
0,"And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to the adoption of the flexible average inflation-targeting framework, which is a policy tool designed to achieve the FOMC's long-term inflation goal of 2%. This framework allows for periods of both above and below 2% inflation to balance out over time, suggesting a commitment to a symmetric inflation target rather than an immediate tightening or easing of policy. It indicates a strategic approach to managing inflation without specifying a current direction for monetary policy, thus it is best classified as neutral."
2,"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that labor costs, which are a component of overall inflation, have not been rising. This implies that there is less pressure on inflation from the labor market, which could mean that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. A dovish stance is typically associated with maintaining or easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that global economic growth is slowing down and there is a trend of falling inflation rates worldwide, which could lead to lower inflation in the United States. This suggests that there may be less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for easing to support economic growth and prevent too low inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,But this is largely accounted for by a convergence of inflation rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But this is largely accounted for by a convergence of inflation rates"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests an observation of inflation trends, which could be interpreted as the FOMC noting that inflation rates are becoming more uniform or stable. This could be seen as a neutral statement because it does not directly imply any immediate action to either increase or decrease the interest rate or adjust monetary policy. It simply acknowledges a condition of the inflation environment without suggesting a clear policy response."
0,"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance, which typically involves lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity, until the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and inflation moderately exceeding 2% for some time are met. This suggests a focus on supporting economic growth and employment rather than on tightening policy to combat inflation, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In general, participants viewed recent consumer price developments as consistent with their expectation that inflation was on a trajectory to achieve the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation is aligning with the Committee's expectations and moving towards their target, suggesting that current monetary policy settings are appropriate to achieve their goals. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy, but rather a continuation of the current approach."
2,"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.""","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to a quip by economist Robert Solow and does not directly indicate any current stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's current views on employment, inflation, or interest rates, nor does it suggest any particular action regarding the tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding municipal bond spreads and investor demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects an improvement in market conditions since the previous FOMC meeting, suggesting a return to pre-pandemic levels, but does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on bond spreads and investor demand is more about market dynamics than a direct comment on the FOMC's policy actions or intentions."
0,"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite significant monetary easing and fiscal stimulus measures, there are expectations of slow growth in consumer spending and housing demand due to sluggish hiring and a decline in household wealth. This suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there may be room for further monetary easing to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate the economy."
1,The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about rising inflation expectations, as evidenced by the increase in inflation compensation from Treasury securities. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming unanchored and exceeding their long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflationary pressures by potentially increasing interest rates or taking other measures to reduce the money supply."
0,"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of lower oil prices on commodity-exporting countries and the subsequent spillover effects on the global economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on external economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus here is on the observation of international economic developments rather than a clear direction for domestic monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancient Rome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a one percent interest rate nor 200 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy. It seems to be a historical observation about interest rates rather than a comment on current economic conditions or policy decisions. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that rising inflation expectations can lead to higher actual inflation, which suggests a concern for inflationary pressures. This concern typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further and to anchor inflation expectations, in line with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target over the long term."
1,"On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than-expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential sources of higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, such as bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and high rates of resource utilization. The mention of a possible significant rise in inflation expectations altering inflation dynamics suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too quickly, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This is because a hawkish policy stance is typically associated with measures to combat rising inflation, which may include increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply."
1,"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that many participants believe the potential output growth could be higher than the staff's estimates. This optimism about economic growth could lead to a tighter monetary policy stance if the participants think the economy can handle higher interest rates without hindering employment or overshooting the inflation target. Higher potential output growth suggests a stronger economy, which might require less monetary stimulus (or even a withdrawal of stimulus) to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish policy stance."
1,"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of globalization on the consensus regarding the importance of price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather comments on a general trend in economic thinking and international cooperation. The focus on price stability aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, but the sentence does not provide specific information about policy direction or actions."
2,"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where housing activity decreased but then showed signs of improvement due to falling mortgage rates. This indicates a mixed or balanced view of the economy, with no clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's observation of economic indicators without suggesting an immediate need for policy adjustment."
2,"Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where increases in productivity have led to higher profit margins, which could help absorb cost increases temporarily. This observation does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a condition of the economy that could provide some buffer against inflationary pressures without suggesting immediate action by the FOMC. The sentence reflects an understanding of economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's goals but does not imply a shift in policy stance."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past decision by the FOMC to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime after a period of careful study. It does not directly indicate a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a procedural or strategic choice made by the Committee regarding how to conduct monetary policy. The sentence does not provide information on the current direction of policy adjustments or the Committee's response to economic conditions in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In these models, each asset price contains a risk premium that represents the additional return demanded by risk-averse investors for bearing risk.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a fundamental concept in financial economics regarding the composition of asset prices, specifically the risk premium component. It does not directly indicate any current or future actions by the FOMC regarding monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a general statement about how asset prices are determined by market participants' risk preferences, which is independent of the FOMC's policy stance."
1,"The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy; in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflation expectations becoming unanchored and the Federal Reserve's credibility in achieving disinflation. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy more aggressively to control inflation and restore its credibility, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to reduce inflationary pressures, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators--such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers' perceptions of the labor market--remained positive.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a recognition of a slowdown in some aspect of the labor market, other indicators remain positive, suggesting a balanced view of the labor market conditions. This does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as the situation is not definitively pointing in one direction. The FOMC is acknowledging mixed signals, which is consistent with a neutral stance where they are neither particularly hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (easing policy)."
2,"Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of economic conditions, specifically mentioning a stagnation in expenditures on nonresidential structures, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic activity relevant to the FOMC's goals but does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/4 percent since the end of 2003.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement of fact regarding productivity growth rates and does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides context on economic conditions over a specified period. The FOMC may use such data to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in monetary policy."
0,"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation has been low recently and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which suggests there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish monetary policy approach."
1,"Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that the current nominal federal funds rate is lower than near-term inflation expectations, which is seen as unacceptable given the high inflation. This suggests that there is a need to raise the federal funds rate to combat inflation, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflation, one of the FOMC's primary goals."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where economic activity is picking up after a previous slowdown, attributing the slowdown to temporary factors like adverse weather conditions. This statement does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of recent economic conditions, which is a typical component of FOMC statements before they delve into policy decisions. The mention of growth in economic activity could be seen as a positive sign, but without additional context on inflation, employment, or how the Committee plans to respond, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will base its future policy decisions on incoming economic data related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a data-dependent approach that does not inherently lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The stance is balanced and contingent on how the economic outlook evolves, reflecting a neutral position in terms of monetary policy direction."
1,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that rising inflation expectations can lead to higher actual inflation, which suggests a concern for inflationary pressures. This concern typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further and to anchor inflation expectations around their target level. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
0,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary conditions. This is in line with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with policies that are aimed at stimulating economic activity, such as lowering interest rates or other forms of monetary easing, to achieve maximum employment and price stability, especially during challenging times."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite expectations of moderate real growth, the rate of growth is not anticipated to be sufficiently slow to reduce core inflation. This implies a concern about persistent inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from staying above the target level. The focus on preventing high inflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and may indicate a willingness to raise interest rates or take other contractionary measures."
2,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a dependency of foreign economic activity on the recovery in the United States, which does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more of an observation of economic conditions rather than a policy direction. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to foster conditions that lead to stable prices and sustainable economic growth. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather describes the overall goals of the Committee. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide information on current economic conditions or the necessary adjustments to the monetary policy."
2,The demand for commercial paper declined as prime money market mutual funds experienced large net outflows after the net asset value of one such fund fell below $1 per share.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the financial markets where there is a decline in the demand for commercial paper due to outflows from prime money market mutual funds after a drop in the net asset value of one fund. This statement is more of an observation of market conditions rather than an indication of a future policy stance. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on financial stability concerns that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will adjust its asset purchase program based on the evolving economic outlook, particularly concerning the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced approach, where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further data. The statement reflects a readiness to respond to changes in economic conditions in line with their goals of maximum employment and price stability."
1,"In any case, the real federal funds rate is now lower than prior to the easings, at the same time that the unemployment rate is lower and projected growth higher than it was prior to the easings.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is lower than before the monetary policy easing, while the unemployment rate is also lower and projected growth is higher than before the easing. This suggests that the economy is stronger now, which could lead to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the statement may imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical explanation of how trend inflation is determined and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather describes a methodological approach to understanding inflation trends."
1,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that strong productivity growth allows for higher real interest rates without hampering economic growth. Higher real interest rates typically indicate a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This suggests that the FOMC could raise interest rates to manage inflation expectations and aggregate demand, while still maintaining its commitment to maximum employment and stable prices, given the productivity-driven support for higher wages and earnings."
1,"After robust growth in the second quarter, M2 decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of monetary aggregates (M2 and M3) without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It simply reports recent observations of economic indicators, which on their own do not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might use such data to inform their decisions, but this statement does not inherently advocate for a change in policy stance."
2,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's effort to find a theoretical point of balance in the economy, which does not directly indicate a current or future action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a conceptual approach to understanding inflation dynamics rather than a clear policy stance."
1,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Committee's assessment of the current economic situation, noting that despite some negative factors (elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions), the overall economic expansion remains solid. This suggests that the FOMC sees the economy as resilient in the face of these challenges, which does not directly indicate an immediate need for a change in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing. It reflects a balanced view that does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a low federal funds rate is being used to stimulate economic growth and reduce slack in resource utilization, which suggests a policy stance aimed at easing rather than tightening. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies a focus on supporting the economy and employment rather than on controlling inflation."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail about their monetary policy tools rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. The setting of these ranges is part of their regular policy actions to achieve their objectives, and without additional context on whether these ranges represent an increase or decrease from previous levels, or how they relate to the current economic conditions, it is not possible to infer a hawkish or dovish stance. The sentence simply reflects the Committee's ongoing efforts to manage the money supply in a way that is consistent with their long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook on business investment growth due to favorable factors such as attractive pricing, technological improvements, and the availability of financing. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on supportive factors for business investment suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards a need for immediate policy action to either stimulate or cool down the economy."
2,"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are anecdotal reports of retailers planning to reduce prices due to excess inventory, there is no aggregate data to confirm a widespread trend of businesses lowering their profit margins due to increased price sensitivity among consumers. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, as it neither clearly signals an immediate concern for inflation (which would be hawkish) nor indicates a need for policy easing to stimulate demand (which would be dovish). It reflects a balanced view, monitoring the situation without committing to a policy change."
2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment; the approach can be applied equally well by ""inflation hawks,"" ""growth hawks,"" and anyone in between.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the flexibility of inflation targeting in accommodating different policy preferences, whether they prioritize low inflation (""inflation hawks"") or economic growth and employment (""growth hawks""). It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy but rather emphasizes the adaptability of the inflation targeting framework to various policy stances. The sentence suggests that the approach can be tailored to the priorities of a central bank, whether they are more concerned with controlling inflation or supporting growth and employment, without committing to a particular action or indicating a change in policy."
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to reducing monetary accommodation and a decisive response to data with the aim of controlling inflation. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve the FOMC's inflation targets, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or curbing high inflation."
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a theoretical viewpoint on market efficiency and asset pricing, rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather reflects a perspective on how markets might function in theory. This statement does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's likely actions regarding the federal funds rate or other policy measures."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which does not clearly signal a need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neither hawkish nor dovish, but neutral, as it does not imply a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an educational statement that describes the Federal Reserve's general role in conducting monetary policy. It does not provide any specific information about current or future policy actions or stances regarding tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states the Fed's overarching goal of supporting a strong and stable economy, which aligns with its mandate but does not indicate a direction for policy."
1,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to restoring price stability, which suggests that the FOMC may be willing to tighten monetary policy to bring down inflation. This aligns with the goal of achieving stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy often involves increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"As is evident in the right-hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the relationship between growth differentials and capital inflows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It neither indicates an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges factors that could impact the economy but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The mention of oil prices and their economic consequences is a recognition of external factors that could influence inflation and growth, but the statement does not imply a specific policy response, thus it is neutral with respect to the FOMC's stance on monetary policy."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a commentary on the perception of the FOMC's focus, rather than a direct statement about current or future monetary policy actions. It does not indicate a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the dual mandate of the FOMC to achieve both stable prices and maximum employment. The sentence suggests a defense of the Committee's balanced approach to its mandate, without a specific direction on policy stance."
2,"Our test for this step was making ""substantial further progress"" toward our employment and inflation goals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition set by the FOMC for adjusting its policy stance, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing. It reflects a commitment to achieving their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices but does not specify the actions that will be taken once the ""substantial further progress"" is made. This suggests a balanced approach, contingent on future economic indicators."
2,"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on maximum employment as a sustainable level that does not lead to the economy overheating. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the employment part of their mandate without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the current level of employment is seen as sustainable and not inflationary, which aligns with their long-term goals without implying immediate policy action."
1,"Concepts associated with deflation such as liquidity traps and the zero bound on nominal interest rates had, for practical purposes, disappeared from economic thought.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that concerns about deflation and the associated economic conditions that would warrant a more accommodative monetary policy (like a liquidity trap or the zero lower bound problem) are no longer considered relevant. This suggests a shift away from policies aimed at stimulating the economy, which could indicate a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation or overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"What monetary policy affects, primarily, is the state of the business cycle, the amount of excess unemployment or the extent of recession in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general effect of monetary policy on the economy, specifically its impact on the business cycle and levels of unemployment or recession. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather explains the areas where monetary policy has influence. The focus on the business cycle and unemployment aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is currently aiming to tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,Consumer spending firmed somewhat during the first quarter despite the rising unemployment rate and significant financial strains.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that consumer spending has strengthened despite negative economic indicators such as a rising unemployment rate and financial strains. This suggests a mixed economic situation where there is both a positive aspect (firmer consumer spending) and negative aspects (higher unemployment, financial strains). The sentence does not explicitly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a balanced view of economic conditions, which aligns with a NEUTRAL stance. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of indicators and balancing risks without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term implications of increases in productivity growth rates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges a factor that can influence economic performance. Higher productivity growth can lead to non-inflationary growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy stance."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various factors that are expected to support faster real GDP growth, such as easing fiscal policy, rising confidence, better credit availability, improved financial conditions, and stronger foreign economic growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic environment that could influence future policy decisions. The focus is on the conditions that are conducive to growth, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but without a clear direction on the stance of monetary policy."
2,"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's projection of inflation aligns with the mandate-consistent inflation rate, suggesting that the current macroeconomic environment is in line with the FOMC's long-term goals for inflation. This implies neither an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather suggests a stance that is consistent with the FOMC's objectives. The use of the term ""mandate-consistent"" suggests that the current and projected state of inflation is where the Committee believes it should be, which does not advocate for a change in policy in either direction."
1,Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that businesses in some districts are starting to pass higher input costs onto consumers by raising prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures might be building, which could lead the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, in line with its goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are aware of the market's focus on their communication regarding the future path of monetary policy. They stress the importance of conveying that their approach to making policy decisions (reaction function) or their overall commitment to the monetary policy framework remains consistent. This does not directly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes transparency and consistency in their policy approach. It reflects a balanced stance, as it neither signals a clear move towards more aggressive (hawkish) nor more accommodative (dovish) policy actions."
2,"To do this will demand not only greater specialized knowledge, but also an ability to deal with risk and uncertainty.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the need for specialized knowledge and the ability to manage risk and uncertainty, which are general prerequisites for effective monetary policy decision-making. It reflects the FOMC's broader approach to policy-making rather than a specific policy direction."
1,"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants recognize a very tight labor market and inflation levels significantly above their 2 percent target. This suggests a concern for overheating in the economy, which typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to cool down inflation and align it with the Committee's objectives."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate (by 50 or 100 basis points) would not significantly dampen investor optimism regarding the profitability of emerging technologies. This implies that the speaker believes monetary policy tightening (higher interest rates) would not have a desired effect on certain aspects of the economy, which in this context, reflects a stance that is more inclined towards a tighter monetary policy, even if the effectiveness is in question. The mention of not being driven by ""easy money"" also hints at a view that current monetary conditions are not excessively loose."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent need to adjust the federal funds rate due to the presence of uncertainties and low inflation pressures. The use of the word ""patient"" suggests that they are in no rush to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment, especially when inflation is not a concern."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests concern about a potential increase in core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by influencing inflation expectations to rise. This indicates a focus on the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an inflationary spike, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
