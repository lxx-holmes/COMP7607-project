1,"Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of continued economic growth through increases in employment and income, which would support consumer spending. It does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic conditions related to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either tightening or easing of monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is planning to remove policy accommodation, which could be interpreted as a move towards tightening monetary policy, suggesting a hawkish stance. However, the use of the phrase ""balanced approach"" and the reference to the longer-run goals of maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent suggest that the Committee is also considering the dovish aspect of supporting the economy and not just focusing on controlling inflation. The commitment to balance and the specific long-term goals indicate a neutral stance, as the Committee is neither signaling an aggressive tightening nor an easing of policy, but rather a measured approach to adjusting policy as needed to achieve its dual mandate."
2,Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of rising agricultural crop prices and an improvement in farm revenues, which is a factual statement about a specific sector and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The impact on the broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates is not clear from this sentence alone."
0,"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation has been low recently and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which suggests there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, in line with the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil have already begun tightening their monetary policy by increasing interest rates in response to expectations of higher inflation. Tightening monetary policy, which often involves raising interest rates, is a measure taken to control inflation and is thus considered a hawkish stance. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the action described is a proactive step to prevent inflation from rising above the targeted level."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the potential consequences of rapidly increasing interest rates, which is a tightening monetary policy action. The mention of not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve anticipates a scenario where its income might be reduced due to higher interest costs on its holdings, a situation that could arise if the Fed raises rates to combat inflation or overheating in the economy. The concern about the congressional response indicates that the Fed is aware of the broader implications of its policy decisions, but the primary focus on rising interest rates points to a hawkish stance."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic slowdown is partly temporary and anticipates greater growth in the future. This implies an expectation of economic recovery without the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to encourage economic growth. The sentiment expressed does not indicate a concern for rising inflation that would necessitate a hawkish approach."
2,Prospects for ProductivityLet me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Prospects for Productivity—Let me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It merely indicates that the speaker is going to discuss their views on productivity outlook, which could potentially impact monetary policy decisions but does not inherently suggest a stance towards tightening or easing. The sentence is neutral as it does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the nature of foreign trade deficits, suggesting that they tend to correct themselves over time without implying any immediate action or concern for monetary policy. It does not provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC when determining their monetary policy stance."
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects inflation to be higher than previously anticipated due to persistent upward pressure from import and commodity prices. This suggests a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the FOMC's target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,Monetary policy has an ambiguous effect on trade imbalances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it makes a general statement about the effects of monetary policy on trade imbalances, which does not inherently suggest a move to raise or lower interest rates or to adjust monetary conditions in a way that would be clearly hawkish or dovish. It reflects an understanding of the complexity of economic relationships without committing to a specific policy direction."
2,"So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement regarding the timing of an employment report rather than an indication of a policy stance. It does not provide any information on whether the Federal Reserve is considering tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence lacks context on the content of the May employment report and its implications for monetary policy, making it neutral in terms of policy stance."
2,Price shocks.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Price shocks"" by itself does not provide enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It is a neutral term that could be associated with either inflationary pressures (which might suggest a hawkish response) or deflationary pressures (which might suggest a dovish response). Without additional context on the nature of the price shocks, their impact on the economy, or the FOMC's response to them, the stance cannot be determined. Price shocks could lead to a change in monetary policy if they affect inflation or employment significantly, but this sentence alone does not indicate a direction for policy change."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite core inflation and the trimmed mean PCE inflation rate being slightly below the 2% target, many FOMC participants expect inflation to remain near the target due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests that the FOMC sees the economy operating near its full potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the Committee might be inclined to maintain or increase interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, reflecting a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
2,"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe there is still slack in the labor market, as evidenced by certain labor market indicators (like the employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation rate for prime-age workers) not having fully recovered to pre-recession levels, and the lack of significant wage growth. This suggests that these participants do not see immediate inflationary pressures from the labor market, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
1,"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation is significantly above the target level, and it emphasizes the importance of reducing inflation to achieve the FOMC's goals of price stability and maximum employment. The use of ""strongly believe"" suggests a firm stance on the need to address high inflation, which typically leads to tightening monetary policy to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining a low federal funds rate until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a return to the 2% inflation target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed this target for some time. This approach is aimed at supporting economic recovery and ensuring that inflation and employment goals are sustainably achieved before considering policy tightening."
1,"On the supply side, the effect is fairly clear and immediate: An increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace of growth of the economy's productive capacity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between productivity growth and the economy's productive capacity, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It simply states an economic principle that higher trend productivity growth leads to a faster increase in the economy's capacity to produce goods and services. This statement does not indicate whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context for understanding economic dynamics. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to understanding the factors that influence the economy's performance, which is essential for making informed policy decisions."
2,Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced"" suggests that the members of the FOMC perceive the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as neither particularly high nor low. This indicates that they do not see a pressing need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more aggressively at the moment, reflecting a stance that is neither hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather one that maintains the current policy position."
2,"It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the impact of energy prices on core inflation has been minimal since the early 1980s, implying that core inflation is likely to remain low. It also suggests that overall inflation is expected to decrease as long as inflation expectations are kept in check. This perspective aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests there is less concern about rising inflation that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Instead, it points towards a scenario where there is room for maintaining or easing the policy to support employment and economic growth without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is merely referencing a descriptive work about the experiences of transition economies with inflation targets. It does not indicate any specific policy stance or suggest a direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It is an academic observation rather than a policy statement."
0,"Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations along with the risks to the U. S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow U. S. economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for easing monetary policy by suggesting a policy rate reduction. This action is justified by persistent low inflation readings and subdued inflation expectations, which are below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Additionally, the mention of providing insurance against potential negative developments that could hinder U.S. economic growth further supports a dovish stance, as it implies a readiness to stimulate the economy in the face of potential risks."
2,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, they are still low, and survey-based expectations for long-term inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests that the FOMC sees some signs of inflation but not enough to warrant a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The statement reflects an observation of current economic indicators without a strong implication of immediate action to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past assessment of inflation forecasting without directly indicating a future policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply acknowledges a discrepancy between expected and actual inflation outcomes, which is part of the FOMC's regular analysis and does not inherently suggest a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish position."
0,"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic principle regarding the negative effects of deflation, similar to those of inflation, on the economy's resource allocation and potential. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of maintaining stable prices, which is one of the FOMC's key objectives. The stance is neutral as it simply acknowledges the challenges posed by deflation without suggesting a specific policy action."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July; however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation regarding the U.S. trade deficit without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It neither indicates an immediate concern for inflation that would warrant a tightening of policy (hawkish) nor does it suggest economic weakness that would require an easing of policy (dovish). The information provided is more related to economic conditions than to specific monetary policy actions."
0,"One participant remarked that, with inflation having run consistently below 2 percent in recent years and market-based measures of inflation compensation still low, postponing an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would help push inflation expectations up to levels consistent with the Committee's objective.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that a participant of the FOMC believes that delaying an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate could help in raising inflation expectations to align with the Committee's goal of a 2% inflation rate. This indicates a preference for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate inflation, which is consistent with a dovish approach."
0,"Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the timing and potential consequences of raising interest rates in response to economic bubbles, suggesting that such action might worsen instability rather than mitigate it. This indicates a cautious approach to policy adjustment, weighing the risks of action against the uncertain effects, rather than a clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (advocating for tightening) nor dovish (advocating for easing), but rather acknowledges the complexities and potential trade-offs involved in policy decisions."
1,So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that higher gasoline prices are exerting upward pressure on inflation. This situation would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that fiscal stimulus may lead to higher inflation expectations (as seen by increased inflation compensation) and a steeper yield curve, which often suggests that investors expect stronger economic growth and potentially higher inflation. A broad dollar depreciation can also be inflationary as it makes imports more expensive. In response to these developments, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation that national saving has increased, which has provided further impetus to economic growth. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reports on an economic condition related to growth. It does not explicitly suggest any adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools, nor does it directly address concerns about inflation or employment levels."
1,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to not easing monetary policy until there is convincing and compelling evidence that inflation is decreasing. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on combating inflation and is prepared to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to achieve its price stability goal, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where household spending is strong despite an economic downturn, suggesting resilience in that sector, but it also indicates potential limitations on future growth in spending. Additionally, it mentions competitive pressures that could limit profits, investment, and equity prices. This reflects a balanced view of the economy, with both positive and negative aspects, and does not directly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on the observation of economic conditions rather than a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the external sector will have a slight dampening effect on economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of one of the many factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC will respond to this influence by adjusting the monetary policy to counteract it, thus it is considered neutral."
2,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between consumer spending and changes in home values, particularly in the context of sophisticated mortgage markets like those in the United States. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on economic behavior that could be relevant to the FOMC's decision-making. The sentence suggests that changes in home values might have a more significant impact on consumer spending than in the past, which is an important factor for the FOMC to consider when assessing economic conditions and setting policy, but it does not advocate for a specific policy direction."
0,"Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target for some time, following periods when it has been below that level. This suggests a stance of monetary easing, or at least a tolerance for higher inflation, which is typically associated with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The FOMC is signaling that it would not rush to tighten policy in response to inflation that is above target, as long as it is correcting for previous periods of below-target inflation. This approach is aimed at ensuring long-term price stability and supporting the FOMC's mandate of maximum employment."
2,"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC decided to maintain the same growth ranges for the monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach reflects a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making adjustments in response to changes in economic conditions."
2,"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation affecting emerging markets due to declines in oil prices, which is an external economic factor. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. Instead, it acknowledges an economic condition that could potentially influence the Committee's policy decisions. The sentence does not provide information on how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response to these conditions, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,It was the year of synchronized global growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It was the year of synchronized global growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a descriptive statement about the state of the global economy, without any explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. It does not provide information on inflation, employment, or interest rates, which are the key factors the FOMC considers when determining its policy stance."
2,Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in China, noting a slight deceleration in output growth, but does not directly indicate a change in U.S. monetary policy stance. It provides context on global economic conditions, which the FOMC may consider in its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy."
2,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a significant drop in unemployment, inflation has not increased as might be expected. This suggests that the economy can sustain lower levels of unemployment without triggering inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to cool down the economy. The FOMC may therefore be more inclined to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment, as the lack of inflationary response provides room to prioritize their employment goals without compromising their inflation target."
2,"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the nature of policymaking as a complex and uncertain process. It neither suggests an intention to raise nor lower interest rates, nor does it comment on the current state of employment or inflation. Therefore, it does not indicate a hawkish or dovish stance but rather acknowledges the challenges involved in making monetary policy decisions."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tolerance for inflation levels moderately above the 2% target, which suggests that the speaker is not in favor of immediate tightening measures to counteract slightly higher inflation. However, the context of this sentence is crucial. If the current inflation rate is significantly above 2%, the statement could be seen as hawkish because it implies acceptance of higher inflation without immediate policy action to reduce it, which could eventually lead to tightening measures if inflation persists. On the other hand, if inflation is near or just above 2%, the statement might be seen as neutral or even dovish, as it suggests a willingness to allow for some inflation above the target without immediate tightening. Given the lack of context about the current inflation rate, the stance leans towards hawkish, as it implies a higher threshold for taking action against inflation, which could lead to a delayed but eventual tightening of policy if inflation remains above the target."
2,"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a projection of inflation rates that are close to the FOMC's target of 2%, indicating that the current monetary policy stance is aimed at maintaining this level of inflation over the medium term. The projection suggests a slight overshoot this year, a return to target next year, and a minimal overshoot in the following year, which does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation of inflation rates that are generally consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals for price stability."
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while employment is holding steady and labor markets remain tight, there are indications of some softening. This suggests a balanced view where there is no clear immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might interpret this as a situation where the current policy stance is appropriate to maintain progress towards their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"In essence, monetary credibility helps the central bank do its job, by inducing private sector participants also to take actions that help achieve the central bank's low inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the central bank's credibility in maintaining low inflation influences the private sector to act in ways that support this goal. This suggests a commitment to a tighter monetary policy stance to ensure low inflation, which is a hallmark of a hawkish approach. The focus on low inflation aligns with the FOMC's objective of price stability and indicates a willingness to adjust policy to prevent inflation from rising."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it, as it suggests that the FOMC would not raise interest rates solely due to low unemployment unless it is accompanied by inflation. This aligns with a dovish approach, where the focus is on supporting employment and not preemptively raising rates without clear signs of inflation, which could potentially slow down economic activity."
2,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has decided to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach reflects a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making adjustments in response to new economic data or changes in the economic outlook."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio. It does not directly indicate a policy action or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting on recent employment trends, which could be seen as positive indicators for the economy, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, without additional context on how these trends are influencing the Committee's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
2,The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a consensus on maintaining the view that risks to economic growth are balanced, which suggests that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. This stance reflects a position where they are not signaling a shift towards more aggressive measures to combat inflation (hawkish) or indicating a need to stimulate the economy (dovish), but rather maintaining a steady course with regard to their policy outlook."
1,"In part, the high inflation reflects supply chain disruptions associated with the economic effects of the pandemic and efforts made to contain it.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a cause of high inflation, attributing it to supply chain disruptions related to the pandemic, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges an external factor influencing inflation, which is part of the economic assessment the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly indicate a stance on adjusting the monetary policy but rather provides context for the inflationary environment."
0,"In the absence of such offsetting operations, a decrease in currency demand would raise the amount of reserves and hence lower the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mechanical relationship between currency demand, reserves, and the federal funds rate, without indicating a policy change or preference. It explains that a decrease in currency demand would naturally lead to an increase in reserves, which would then lower the federal funds rate, assuming no offsetting operations are conducted by the Federal Reserve. This is a statement of fact rather than a policy stance, as it does not suggest any active measures being taken by the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply outlines the dynamics of the federal funds market."
1,"Some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one District, contacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor shortages.","NEUTRAL

The sentence presents a mixed view of the economic conditions, with some business contacts observing subdued wage and price pressures, while others in a different District notice rising wage pressures and labor shortages. This suggests that there is no clear, uniform direction for monetary policy adjustments, as the information is not consistent across all areas. The FOMC might see this as a signal to maintain the current policy stance until a clearer trend emerges, balancing the risks and long-term goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members perceive an improvement in the inflation situation and no longer find it necessary to wait for further evidence of sustained moderation in inflation pressures. This suggests that they may be less inclined to introduce further monetary easing measures and could be considering tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with their goal of maintaining stable prices. The acknowledgment of improved inflation conditions implies readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) could lead to higher interest rates for borrowers in other sectors compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. This concern implies a preference for a policy that might avoid such an outcome, which could be interpreted as a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent an increase in interest rates across various sectors. Tightening monetary policy is generally associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it signal a clear direction for future policy moves. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth reflects the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve and is consistent with a balanced approach to monetary policy."
2,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economic problem being discussed is serious but also states that its underlying causes are not related to monetary policy or the response to the pandemic. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a role for monetary policy to address this specific issue, as it falls outside the scope of their typical tools or interventions. The stance is neither explicitly suggesting a tightening nor an easing of policy, but rather acknowledging the limitations of monetary policy in this context."
2,"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. It suggests a balanced perspective without signaling a change in policy stance."
2,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a slight increase in the consumer price index (CPI) due to energy prices, the core CPI inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—remained low. This suggests that the underlying inflationary pressures are stable, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting observed data without a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"Without the accompanying boost to productivity, our progress toward price stability might well have been marked by the social pressures that arose in many previous episodes of disinflation both here and abroad.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that without an increase in productivity, efforts to achieve price stability (i.e., controlling inflation) could lead to social pressures, which historically have been associated with periods of disinflation. This suggests a willingness to accept such pressures as a consequence of tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U. S. Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external factors, specifically international monetary policy actions, are influencing U.S. Treasury securities and potentially affecting term premiums. It does not directly indicate a stance on the FOMC's own monetary policy actions (whether they are looking to tighten or ease monetary policy). Instead, it reflects an observation of market dynamics and international influences, which the FOMC might take into account when making decisions. The sentence does not suggest a clear direction for future policy moves but rather acknowledges the impact of global financial conditions on the U.S. economy."
2,"The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there are multiple factors (monetary ease, fiscal stimulus, productivity gains, and improved business confidence) that are expected to stimulate spending significantly. This implies that the economy is receiving substantial support, which could lead to increased inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if spending increases too much, it could push inflation above the target level, which might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a hawkish stance, as it points to conditions that may require a reduction in monetary accommodation to prevent overheating of the economy."
0,"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decrease to levels below what is considered consistent with the FOMC's goals of price stability and maximum employment. The anticipated slowdown in inflation is attributed to recent declines in energy and commodity prices, as well as a period of significant economic slack. This outlook implies that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not seen as a current threat, and there may be room for policies that support economic growth and employment."
1,Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent; several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants expect inflation to rise due to tighter resource utilization and increasing wage pressures, as well as a declining dollar value, which they believe will help inflation return to the 2 percent target. This expectation of rising inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from overshooting their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
2,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation stating how long it took for employment and inflation to stabilize after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reflects on past events and the time it took for the economy to align with the FOMC's mandates of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states that the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability are compatible goals in the long run, which suggests a balanced view without indicating a current or future direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an understanding that the dual mandate can be achieved over time, without implying immediate action to adjust the policy stance."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve stable prices and support sustainable economic growth, which are key aspects of its dual mandate (the other being maximum employment). It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather states the overall goals of the Committee. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the stock market experienced a positive surge, core inflation—which is a key indicator for monetary policy—has moderated. This suggests a balance between economic growth (as evidenced by a soaring stock market) and the FOMC's goal of stable prices (with core inflation moderating). The sentence does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather presents a scenario where there is a positive economic outcome without the downside of increasing inflation."
1,"Nonetheless, the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time; such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite an increase in compensation, there is no significant evidence of accelerating price inflation, and there are uncertainties regarding labor market behavior and the economy's potential growth. This suggests that the FOMC sees less immediate risk of overheating in the economy, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. The mention of ""persisting uncertainties"" also suggests a cautious approach, which is more aligned with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing monetary policy to encourage employment and economic growth within the context of stable prices."
2,"Even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members expect the economy to slow down to a rate that aligns with its potential growth, which suggests a balanced view of economic conditions. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather an observation of the economy moving towards its potential growth rate. This can be seen as consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for future policy changes."
0,"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants are concerned about slow output growth and a potentially prolonged reduction in unemployment levels. This concern suggests a stance that leans towards easing monetary policy to support economic growth and accelerate the reduction of unemployment, consistent with the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The lack of concern about inflationary pressures and the focus on supporting the economy imply a dovish stance."
2,"Of course, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed’s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a willingness to maintain transparency and provide information to Congress for evaluation purposes but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance. It neither implies an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather communicates openness and accountability in the Federal Reserve's operations."
1,"With an increase in the target range at this meeting, the federal funds rate would be at or close to the lower end of the range of estimates of the longer-run neutral interest rate, and participants expressed that recent developments, including the volatility in financial markets and the increased concerns about global growth, made the appropriate extent and timing of future policy firming less clear than earlier.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to increase the target range for the federal funds rate, which is a move towards tightening monetary policy. The reference to the ""longer-run neutral interest rate"" suggests that the rate increase is intended to bring the policy stance closer to a level that neither stimulates nor restricts economic growth. However, the mention of recent developments and uncertainties about future policy firming indicates that while the current decision is hawkish, there is some caution about the pace and extent of future rate increases due to economic uncertainties."
1,We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence merely observes a market phenomenon, noting the ""remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market."" It does not directly indicate a policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is descriptive and does not suggest a response or adjustment to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a direction for future policy."
2,"It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a balanced approach to determining what constitutes maximum employment, indicating that the FOMC considers a range of factors beyond just headline unemployment figures. This suggests a comprehensive analysis of the employment situation without a clear bias towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the complexity of the employment goal and does not directly signal a move to adjust interest rates or change the monetary stance."
1,Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC participants expect higher inflation due to cyclical pressures from a tightening labor market. This expectation of higher inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to cool down economic activity and control inflation."
2,"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a hypothetical scenario where the economy is assumed to be at an ideal state, with full employment and inflation at target levels. It does not indicate any particular action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather sets a baseline assumption for discussion or analysis."
2,Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing and thus reduce household and business demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking actions (increasing rates and reducing the balance sheet) that would lead to higher borrowing costs, which is typically done to cool down the economy and combat inflation. This is a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC is monitoring key economic indicators, such as wages and inflation, which are central to their mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on the trends or levels of these indicators, or the Committee's interpretation of the data, it is not possible to determine whether this statement leans toward a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, reflecting ongoing assessment rather than a clear policy bias."
0,"Some members expressed a concern that in this context any further adverse shocks could have disproportionate effects, resulting in a significant slowing in growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members are worried about the potential for adverse shocks to have a larger-than-expected negative impact on economic growth. This concern implies a cautious stance towards tightening monetary policy, as doing so could exacerbate the risks of a slowdown. Therefore, the sentiment leans towards a dovish approach, favoring a more accommodative policy to support growth in the face of possible adverse conditions."
2,"If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the future, it has significant implications for risk management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence on risk management, macroeconomic modeling, and monetary policy, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC should consider these factors in their policy decisions, but it does not provide information on whether the policy should be more hawkish or dovish. Instead, it emphasizes the need for careful consideration of economic and financial market dynamics in the context of monetary policy-making."
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of credit conditions and loan growth in the commercial real estate sector without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that credit conditions have continued to ease and that there is solid growth in CRE loans, which could be seen as a sign of economic stability. However, it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy in response to these conditions. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish policy direction."
1,"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the potential negative consequences of further asset purchases, such as complications in withdrawing policy accommodation, inflationary risks, and threats to financial stability. These concerns suggest a cautious or restrictive stance towards additional monetary easing, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and maintain price stability."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to inflationary pressures to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of market reactions to expectations of the Federal Reserve's tapering (reducing asset purchases), which led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility. It does not directly indicate a future policy stance but rather reflects on the consequences of past expectations about policy changes. The impact on emerging market economies (EMEs) is noted, but the sentence does not advocate for a specific direction in monetary policy, nor does it suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing. It is simply recounting the effects of market anticipation of the Fed's actions on global financial conditions."
0,The staff's forecast for core PCE price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's forecast for core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price inflation has been revised downward due to recent data. This suggests that inflation pressures may be less than previously expected, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. A downward revision in inflation forecasts is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it may lead to maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic activity, given that inflation is not accelerating as fast as anticipated."
2,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic conditions, noting the strength in household spending and its role in balancing weaker areas of the economy. It does not directly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic factors that the FOMC considers in its policy decisions. The focus on both strength (in household spending) and weakness (in overall economic activity) suggests a balanced view without a clear direction towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It discusses the uncertain impact of a productivity slowdown on employment growth in the medium term, which does not directly suggest a need for immediate policy adjustment. The statement is more about the uncertainty in economic conditions rather than a clear path for monetary policy."
2,"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's recent actions to enhance their policy statement and forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate and asset purchases, as well as providing more information about their policy reaction function. This statement does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes transparency and communication improvements. The mention of ""upgraded our forward guidance"" and ""unprecedented information"" suggests a focus on clarity and predictability, which are neutral actions aimed at effectively guiding market expectations without indicating a specific direction for future monetary policy."
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market participants' reactions to a report and the subsequent effect on Treasury yields, rather than directly stating the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The rise in Treasury yields could be due to a variety of factors and does not necessarily reflect a change in policy stance."
2,"So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works."" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a general statement affirming the effectiveness of monetary policy through various channels. It does not provide information on whether the policy stance will be more hawkish or dovish in response to economic conditions, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a stance of uncertainty regarding economic conditions, which suggests that the FOMC is taking a wait-and-see approach before committing to any specific policy changes. This stance is consistent with a balanced view that is neither clearly hawkish nor dovish, as it acknowledges the challenges in forecasting economic indicators without suggesting an immediate policy response."
0,"The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not persisting over time, which implies that there is less concern about long-term inflationary pressures. This could indicate that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an educational statement that describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate and does not provide any specific information about current monetary policy actions or stances. It does not indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the purpose of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy."
1,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the central bank has raised interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down economic activity and prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the potential broad economic impacts of monetary policy actions targeted at a specific sector, suggesting a cautious approach. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of policy decisions and their wide-ranging effects. This reflects a balanced stance, weighing the risks of policy actions against their intended outcomes."
1,"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been rising, which is often a concern for the Federal Reserve. Higher inflation typically prompts the Fed to consider tightening monetary policy to stabilize prices, which aligns with one of their main goals. The mention of higher prices for commodities and imported goods as drivers of inflation suggests that the FOMC might lean towards a more hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The mention of underutilization implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support the labor market and stimulate economic activity without the immediate risk of causing inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
0,"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is exhibiting strong demand and tightness, which often correlates with upward pressure on wages and potential inflationary concerns. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic conditions and factors that have led to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, such as higher U.S. interest rates, expectations of tax reform, and actions by foreign central banks. It does not directly indicate a future stance of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve but rather provides context on recent economic developments. The statement is factual and does not suggest a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Case studies of individual industries show that, in some cases, the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the effectiveness of technological investments in certain industries and their impact on productivity and profits, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a signal of future policy actions."
1,"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend."" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a trend of a decreasing natural rate of unemployment, which could be interpreted as a positive development towards maximum employment. However, without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this trend, it is not possible to determine a hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the sentence is classified as neutral."
2,"Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered in shorter time frames, or improved in quality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of entrepreneurs in a market economy, using market prices to gauge consumer preferences and improve products and services. It does not directly indicate any stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it does not reflect a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance in the context of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy objectives."
0,"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC expect a strong expansion in economic activity, supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus, positive financial conditions, and increasing productivity. This outlook suggests that the economy is performing well, which may lead to concerns about overheating and the potential for inflationary pressures. In such a context, a hawkish stance would be appropriate to preemptively tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of ""continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies"" implies that there is an active role for policy in sustaining the expansion, but the overall tone suggests readiness to adjust policy to prevent the economy from running too hot, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the overnight rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that the monetary policymakers might use, which is influencing market expectations of future short-term interest rates, rather than directly stating an intention to change the current policy rate. This approach does not clearly indicate whether the policy stance is leaning towards tightening or easing, but rather discusses a method of indirect influence on economic conditions. It reflects a tactical consideration rather than a direct policy action, and thus does not commit to a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that certain measures of inflation (trimmed price indexes) are close to the FOMC's target inflation rate of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is under control and may not require further easing of monetary policy. In fact, if inflation is stable and close to the target, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of economic conditions, noting that there has been growth in consumer spending and exports, which contributed to the expansion of economic activity. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide a clear signal about the Committee's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate. The statement is simply reporting on recent economic developments without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that banks can sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates, which implies that the FOMC sees room for raising interest rates without causing undue harm to the banking sector. This is indicative of a tightening of monetary policy, as higher interest rates are typically used to control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. The mention of increased net interest margin for banks in the context of higher rates also aligns with a hawkish stance, as it points to the benefits of a higher rate environment for the banking industry."
2,"Participants agreed to continue to explore ways to increase transparency and clarity in the Committee's policy communications, and they indicated a willingness to look into modifications to the SEP. At the end of the discussion, the Chairman asked the subcommittee on communications to explore potential approaches to providing more information about the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy through the SEP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) approach to communication and transparency rather than directly indicating a shift in monetary policy stance. It discusses the exploration of ways to enhance the clarity of policy communications and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which is a tool for conveying the Committee's economic outlook and policy expectations. This does not inherently suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to improve the way in which policy decisions and outlooks are presented to the public."
2,"On the more positive side, there were no signs that the pace of productivity gains was currently leveling out and no evidence of rising longer-term inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that productivity is continuing to grow without signs of abating and that longer-term inflation expectations are stable. This suggests a balanced view where there is no immediate pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on these factors. The statement reflects an observation of current economic conditions without implying a clear direction for future policy changes. It aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, as well as the target inflation rate, but does not suggest a need to adjust policy in response to these particular observations."
2,"On the other hand, by that metric, the, the September 16, 2020 unemployment rate would have been in the—in the 20s in, in April.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on a historical unemployment rate and does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance. It seems to be providing context or a comparison rather than suggesting a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on a past unemployment rate does not inherently suggest a commitment to either raise or lower interest rates or to adjust monetary policy in any specific direction."
1,It was also noted that the weakness in homebuilding along with the continued rise in house prices suggested that supply constraints were also weighing on construction activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the housing market, noting that weakness in homebuilding and rising house prices indicate supply constraints affecting construction activity. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of current economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring various economic indicators, which could influence future policy decisions, but it does not in itself indicate a clear stance towards a more hawkish or dovish policy direction."
0,"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a recognition of the risks associated with very low (zero or negative) inflation rates, which could suggest a bias towards avoiding such scenarios by potentially tightening monetary policy to keep inflation within the target range. This stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices with a 2% inflation target, and the acknowledgment of these risks indicates a preference for avoiding deflationary conditions that might warrant a more contractionary policy."
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are concerns about potential lower-than-expected inflation (downside risks), the majority view is that the risks to the inflation outlook are neither particularly skewed towards higher nor lower inflation, but are balanced. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on the current inflation outlook, reflecting a neutral stance."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies that the conditions are expected to become more conducive to growth without necessarily leading to inflationary pressures, which could mean there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The expectation of easing supply constraints aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a scenario where the FOMC might not need to intervene aggressively to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This communication strategy is aimed at influencing the pricing of longer-term interest rates to align with the monetary policy path they deem most likely. Keeping interest rates low is typically a dovish stance, as it suggests a policy geared towards stimulating economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, with the intention of supporting maximum employment and boosting economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"Participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants' outlook on the economy is stable, with expectations of moderate growth continuing and then gradually increasing. This suggests a steady state of economic conditions without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of the word ""moderate"" implies a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating any immediate concerns that would prompt a change in policy stance."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, indicating that the market's expectations for inflation have not significantly changed. This observation suggests that the FOMC sees no immediate need to adjust its policy stance in response to changing inflation expectations, as the market's view on inflation is stable. It neither indicates a clear intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather reflects an ongoing assessment of economic conditions."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic condition (large current account deficits due to vigorous domestic imports) without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a potential issue (worrisome implications for the future) but does not indicate a clear stance on whether the FOMC should respond with a change in monetary policy. The focus is on the trade balance rather than directly on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC."
2,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of monetary policy, acknowledging its broad and non-specific impact on the economy. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the limitations of the tools at the FOMC's disposal. This statement is more about the nature of monetary policy rather than its direction or stance."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports on trade activity, which could have various implications for the economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate response in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact rather than a policy direction."
1,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that past actions to reduce inflation involved deliberately slowing down economic activity, which can be associated with a tightening of monetary policy. It suggests a willingness to endure short-term economic pain for the long-term benefit of maintaining low inflation and monetary credibility, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability even at the cost of slower economic growth."
1,"Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is rising and has reached a level significantly above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back down to its target level, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants recognize the role of both fiscal support and monetary policy in achieving the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the supportive role of monetary policy alongside fiscal measures. The focus is on promoting a return to the Committee's broad objectives, which implies a balanced approach without a clear direction towards either tightening or easing."
0,The ebbing of stimulus from last year's tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in consumer spending growth due to the diminishing effects of previous tax cuts, which is a neutral observation about economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic factors that could influence future decisions."
2,I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concerns about the scope for monetary policy but does not clearly indicate whether the speaker believes policy should be tightened or eased. It suggests a consideration of the effectiveness or limitations of monetary policy tools without a clear direction on policy stance, thus it is neutral with respect to being hawkish or dovish."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent need to adjust the federal funds rate due to uncertainties and low inflation pressures. The use of the word ""patient"" suggests that they are in no rush to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment."
0,"In response to an unanticipated movement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded, a small variation in interest rates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation in spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation rather than signaling a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It suggests that a small adjustment in interest rates could be used to manage the money supply and keep it on target, but it does not explicitly state whether the FOMC is currently inclined to raise or lower rates. The focus is on maintaining the targeted path for the money supply, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but it does not provide information on the direction of policy change."
1,"Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where employment and economic activity have recovered more quickly and strongly than expected after a significant downturn. This statement is factual and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a positive economic outcome, which could potentially lead to either policy stance depending on the broader economic context and the FOMC's assessment of inflation and employment relative to their objectives."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economic activity was stronger than expected at the end of 1996 and this trend was continuing into 1997. Strong economic activity can lead to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. The reference to ""surprising strength"" suggests that the economy might be overheating, which is a scenario that typically prompts a hawkish response from the FOMC, such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy."
1,"So, you know, as I mentioned, the Committee acutely feels its obligation to move to make sure that we restore price stability and is determined to use its tools to do so.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to restoring price stability, which suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to control inflation. The phrase ""determined to use its tools"" implies potential actions such as raising interest rates to achieve the FOMC's inflation target, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the impact of weak foreign demand on the value of the dollar, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing measures, but rather provides context for understanding currency fluctuations. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction of policy adjustment."
2,"Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators--such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers' perceptions of the labor market--remained positive.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a slowdown, it might be temporary, and other labor market indicators are still positive. This suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging mixed signals from the economy, without a clear inclination towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The Committee seems to be taking a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior; another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses academic research on behavioral finance and the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather reflects on theoretical considerations and the complexity of economic modeling. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, suggesting a willingness to tighten monetary policy as needed to control inflationary pressures. This stance aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, even in the face of rising demand and limited supply, which could lead to higher inflation if not addressed by policy measures. The reference to ""whatever steps were needed"" implies a readiness to increase interest rates or take other contractionary actions to ensure long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy stance."
2,"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it indicates that the speaker will discuss the use of forward guidance as a tool, which is a method of communication about future policy intentions, and also mentions a brief discussion on near-term monetary policy without indicating a stance. This suggests a balanced approach without a clear indication of a shift towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"So, I think you raise a very important point because, although there is a great deal of market focus on the timing of liftoff, what to matter in thinking about the stance of policy is what the entire path of interest rates will look like.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of considering the entire trajectory of interest rates rather than just the initial increase (""liftoff""). This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, focusing on the long-term perspective rather than short-term actions. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to consider the overall path of interest rates in the context of the FOMC's goals."
2,"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic behavior, noting that despite strong profit growth, there has been a modest recovery in capital expenditures, leaving a significant portion of cash buildup unexplained. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of current economic conditions, which the FOMC might use to inform its policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action to adjust the monetary stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that, given no economic shocks and appropriate monetary policy, the FOMC participants expect moderate economic growth and a slight decrease in unemployment. This suggests a balanced view that does not explicitly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an expectation that the current or planned policy stance is sufficient to maintain progress towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Private investors would have to hold more longer-term securities as the Federal Reserve's holdings ran off, making longer-term interest rates somewhat higher than they would be otherwise.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that as the Federal Reserve allows its holdings to run off (i.e., reducing its balance sheet), private investors will need to absorb more longer-term securities. This action is likely to lead to higher longer-term interest rates, which is a sign of tightening monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often aims to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Higher interest rates can also moderate long-term economic growth, which is part of the FOMC's strategy to balance its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"They also generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect that continued gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would align with the goals of economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and achieving the inflation target. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year; sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where increased productivity growth due to cost-cutting could potentially reduce the need for hiring. This statement is neutral because it does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions that could influence employment but does not suggest an immediate policy response. Increased productivity can be beneficial for the economy and help keep inflation in check, but if it leads to less hiring, it could potentially conflict with the goal of maximum employment. The FOMC might consider such information when deciding on policy adjustments, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It states the Committee's broad goals of fostering maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-standing mandate. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms its commitment to its dual mandate."
1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is prepared to tighten monetary policy if the economy shows signs of overheating and inflation rises to undesirably high levels. This suggests a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes the control of inflation over stimulating economic growth."
2,The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) main instrument for conducting monetary policy without indicating a direction for future policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered a neutral statement."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real interest rate, with a focus on how these factors might influence the real interest rate. It does not directly indicate a clear stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it describes a scenario where different economic factors could balance each other out, which is a neutral assessment of economic conditions without a direct policy implication."
2,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's actions to tighten monetary policy, typically by raising interest rates, have historically led to recessions as a consequence of trying to control inflation. This suggests a stance that is more aggressive in combating inflation, even at the potential cost of economic contraction, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance as it aims to reduce inflation, often at the risk of slowing down economic growth."
0,"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a scenario where economic activity is severely disrupted, resulting in lower real GDP and inflation, and a higher unemployment rate. This suggests that the economy is underperforming relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In such a context, a dovish stance would be more likely, as the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and counteract the negative trends in GDP, inflation, and unemployment."
0,"In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted.","DOVISH

The sentence ""In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted"" suggests that inflation is not currently a concern, as it is not rising at an alarming rate. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment. The FOMC may see no immediate need to increase interest rates if inflation is under control and not threatening their long-term target of 2%."
2,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.2 Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's adoption of a new framework and the alignment of its policy statement and forward guidance with this framework. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the consistency of recent decisions with the new strategy. The focus is on the approach and methodology of policy implementation rather than a specific policy direction."
0,"Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding municipal bond spreads and investor demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides an update on financial conditions that the FOMC might consider in their policy decisions. The recovery in investor demand and the return of spreads to pre-pandemic levels could be seen as a sign of market stabilization, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not commit to any specific monetary policy action."
2,Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s"" is a historical statement that does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It simply reflects a period of stable prices in the past, without suggesting any current or future actions to tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting continued expansion and a gradual return of inflation to target levels. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather conveys an expectation of steady progress towards the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factor contributing to economic growth in the past quarter and anticipates a change in that factor which is expected to lead to slower growth in the current quarter. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy stance. The FOMC might use such information to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for any particular action."
2,"In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not see evidence of increasing price inflation or rising inflation expectations, suggesting that there is no immediate concern about inflationary pressures that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The mention that the declines in inflation and expectations are no longer occurring implies that the situation is stabilizing, but without the need for aggressive policy measures to combat high inflation. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus might be on supporting employment and economic growth rather than on preventing inflation."
0,"In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that under a price-level-targeting scheme, the persistence of deflation (a general decline in prices) would lead to an increasing gap between the actual price level and the targeted price level, which is set to rise over time. This scenario implies that the economy is experiencing lower than desired inflation, or even deflation, which is below the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2%. A dovish stance would be appropriate in this context as it would likely lead to monetary policy actions aimed at stimulating the economy to increase the price level, such as lowering interest rates or implementing quantitative easing measures. These actions would be in line with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and would be intended to counteract deflationary pressures."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective that does not explicitly signal a change in policy stance."
2,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that a specific measure of inflation, the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has been stable at or near the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is neither accelerating nor decelerating significantly, which would not necessarily prompt a change in monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not clearly signal a need to tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about the uncertainty or variability in labor market indicators, which could be used to inform future policy decisions. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexity of defining maximum employment due to differing measures of labor market slack, which is a neutral stance as it does not suggest an immediate action but rather an ongoing assessment."
2,"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about the natural rate of unemployment, which is a theoretical concept representing the lowest level of unemployment that can be sustained without causing inflation to rise. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather seeks to understand the level of unemployment that aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment without triggering inflation. This reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions and does not suggest any immediate policy action."
0,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to tolerate a higher inflation rate in exchange for a lower unemployment rate. This indicates a preference for easing monetary policy to support employment, even at the cost of allowing inflation to rise above the target level, which aligns with a dovish stance. The FOMC is showing a readiness to prioritize employment over the strict control of inflation, which is consistent with a more accommodative policy approach."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the challenges in predicting economic outcomes, which is a neutral position in terms of policy direction. The focus here is on the difficulty of making accurate forecasts, not on a specific policy action to adjust employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a conditional stance, where the FOMC is assessing the impact of rising longer-term rates on economic conditions. It does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather suggests that the Committee's response will depend on whether rates stabilize or continue to rise. This reflects a balanced approach, considering the potential effects on the economy before deciding on a monetary policy action."
2,"To provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, I draw your attention to a speech that Chairman Greenspan made earlier this year, entitled ""Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy"" (Greenspan, 2004).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is referencing a speech by former Chairman Greenspan on the topics of risk and uncertainty in monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions such as tightening or easing. Instead, it seems to be setting the stage for a discussion or providing context for an argument, without revealing a clear direction towards hawkish or dovish policy adjustments."
1,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflationary pressures arising from sharply rising medical costs and efforts to shield wages from the impact of increasing energy prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent these factors from pushing inflation above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflation and maintain price stability, which is one of the FOMC's primary goals."
0,"So, with this coronavirus arriving, we judged that the—the net effects of this will be to—to have inflation move down even a little bit more.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects inflation to decrease due to the impact of the coronavirus. This suggests that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy since lower inflation typically aligns with a more accommodative stance to support economic activity. The FOMC might be inclined to ease policy to counteract the negative economic effects of the coronavirus and ensure that inflation moves towards the 2% target."
2,"However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in asset prices dominated by fundamental forces and those driven by non-fundamental forces, policymakers should not target asset prices or try to guide them to the policymakers' estimate of fundamental value.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges policymakers face in discerning the underlying drivers of asset price movements and suggests that they should not target or guide asset prices based on their estimates of fundamental value. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a principle regarding the approach to asset prices in the context of monetary policy. It implies a balanced stance that neither favors intervention in asset markets nor suggests a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments based on asset price movements."
0,"Since June, however, inflation fears have receded, and some financial-market participants have become less optimistic about the economy's near-term growth prospects.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation fears, which might prompt a tightening of monetary policy, have receded, and there is also a less optimistic view of near-term economic growth. This suggests that there may be less pressure to increase interest rates, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support economic growth, especially when inflation is not seen as a pressing concern."
0,The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to making adjustments to its securities holdings based on new information to support its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows a readiness to respond to economic changes as necessary. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction to achieve its dual mandate."
1,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is robust, with low unemployment and rising wages. This scenario could lead to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Strong wage gains can contribute to higher inflation, which the FOMC may address by raising interest rates to maintain price stability, one of its key mandates."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, specifically the performance of equity prices over a period. This statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should adjust interest rates or alter its monetary policy to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide information on inflation pressures or employment shortfalls, which are key considerations for determining a hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the slow growth of monetary aggregates (such as money supply) indicates that the current monetary policy is not too stimulative or loose. This suggests that there may be no need to ease policy further, and it could even hint at a preference for tightening if the growth of these aggregates is considered too sluggish. The focus on avoiding an overly accommodative stance aligns with a hawkish view, which prioritizes preventing inflation over stimulating growth."
2,"In that regard, the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges that changes in the macroeconomic environment will be considered during the monetary policy review, which could have implications for financial stability. This suggests a balanced approach, weighing the potential impacts on the economy without committing to a specific policy action."
2,Implications of Economic Theory I am going to assert some conclusions based on economic theory that help to understand the potential for monetary policy to achieve these objectives and the consistency among them.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the use of economic theory to understand the potential for monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's objectives and the consistency among those objectives. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather speaks to the theoretical underpinnings that guide the FOMC's approach to achieving its goals. The focus is on understanding and analysis, rather than on immediate policy action."
0,"A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members believe that the current economic conditions, which include high unemployment and inflation at or below the target level, may justify further securities purchases. This indicates a willingness to engage in monetary easing to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish policy stance. Additional securities purchases typically aim to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate economic activity, which can be particularly helpful when unemployment is elevated and inflation is not a concern."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there may be a need for more tightening overall, an accelerated pace of tightening is not deemed necessary at the moment. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the need to adjust policy due to economic conditions (potential for increased tightening) but also recognizing current factors that allow for a steady approach (remaining economic slack, productivity growth, and contained inflation). The FOMC is neither signaling an immediate move towards tightening (hawkish) nor indicating a need for easing (dovish), but rather maintaining a steady policy stance while being prepared to adjust as necessary."
0,"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC meeting participants are concerned about weak labor market conditions and expect high unemployment to persist, which suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support job growth and economic recovery. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, one of its key goals."
1,"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of the economic situation, noting the end of a recession and a robust recovery with strong GDP growth projected. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather gives context to the economic environment in which the FOMC is making its decisions. The statement reflects on past and current economic performance without a clear signal on the future direction of monetary policy."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a readiness to change the monetary policy stance in response to emerging risks that could affect the achievement of the Committee's goals, but it does not specify whether the adjustment would be towards tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced approach, contingent on future economic developments, and does not commit to a specific direction of policy change."
2,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply observes that an increase in asset prices could lead to a positive contribution, presumably to the economy. This statement does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the potential impact of market dynamics on the economy. It reflects an understanding of economic fluctuations without committing to a specific policy action."
2,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of positive economic performance in terms of growth and labor market conditions without explicitly indicating a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing policy, as it simply forecasts a return to favorable economic conditions."
1,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where public expectations of low inflation lead to moderate wage and price-setting behavior, which in turn helps the Federal Reserve maintain low inflation. This reflects a balanced view of the relationship between public expectations and the Fed's ability to achieve its inflation target. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather emphasizes the importance of managing expectations to maintain price stability."
1,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to restoring price stability, which suggests that the FOMC is focused on controlling inflation. This often involves tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates, to ensure that inflation returns to the target level. The emphasis on price stability over other concerns indicates a hawkish stance."
2,"In fact, the Federal Reserveâ€™s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 Homeownership The important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's Community Affairs Research Conference and the role of expanded access to mortgage credit in increasing homeownership. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it focuses on the effects of mortgage credit accessibility on homeownership rates, which is a more general economic observation rather than a specific policy direction."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering a review and potential changes to its policy framework to better achieve its inflation target of 2% over time. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, with the aim of refining tools and strategies to maintain price stability. It does not directly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an openness to adjustments that could support the long-term inflation goal symmetrically, meaning both preventing inflation from running persistently below or above the 2% target."
1,The invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the invasion and related events are causing increased inflationary pressure and are expected to have a negative impact on economic activity. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract the inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation even at the potential cost of slowing down economic activity. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a trade-off for achieving price stability, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance is considered hawkish because it prioritizes curbing inflation over supporting employment, aligning with a policy that would typically involve increasing interest rates or other measures to reduce economic overheating."
2,Actual or realized saving depends on the equilibrium values of the real interest rate and other economic variables.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a basic economic principle regarding the relationship between saving and various economic variables, including the real interest rate. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the factors that influence saving behavior, which is a neutral observation and does not suggest any particular policy action."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about trade dynamics without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges both positive (firming of economic conditions abroad) and negative (rise in imports due to domestic economic expansion and dollar appreciation) factors that could influence real GDP, suggesting a balanced view on the external sector's impact on the economy. There is no explicit mention of policy tightening or easing, nor is there a clear implication that the FOMC should adjust its stance based on this information alone."
0,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about productivity levels without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. Higher productivity can be associated with a stronger economy, which might imply less need for accommodative policies (dovish stance) or could support the case for tightening to prevent overheating (hawkish stance). However, without additional context on how this productivity figure is being interpreted by the FOMC in terms of their policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
1,Economic DevelopmentsReal economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that real economic activity is expanding at a solid pace, which suggests a strong economy. In the context of the Federal Reserve's goals, this could imply that there is less need for monetary policy easing and potentially more room for tightening to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. A solid pace of economic expansion is often associated with increased inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counteract with a hawkish stance by raising interest rates or implementing other measures to tighten monetary policy."
1,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.","NEUTRAL

The sentence outlines the Federal Reserve's broad mandates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as financial stability, but does not provide information on whether the policy stance will be tightened or eased. It is a general statement of purpose rather than an indication of future policy moves."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that businesses are not increasing prices despite rising labor costs, likely due to strong competition. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The lack of price increases to offset higher labor costs implies that the FOMC might not see an immediate need to raise interest rates to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
2,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will make decisions on the timing and size of adjustments to the federal funds rate based on how actual and expected economic conditions compare to its goals of maximum employment and a symmetric 2 percent inflation target. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather communicates a data-dependent approach that could lead to either outcome depending on how economic indicators align with the FOMC's objectives. It reflects a balanced stance that is contingent on future economic developments."
2,"In recent years, aggressive cost-cutting in the United States has been linked to greater emphasis on maximization of shareholder value and less on growth and diversification, which was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a change in business practices over time, focusing on cost-cutting and shareholder value maximization rather than growth and diversification. This observation does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a commentary on corporate strategies and does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any immediate implications for adjustments in the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the valuation of equity markets and the expectations of future returns, rather than directly commenting on monetary policy actions such as interest rate adjustments or other measures that the Federal Reserve might take to influence economic conditions. It does not explicitly suggest a need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of market sentiment and valuation, which can be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement is neutral as it does not indicate a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,The high oil prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the system.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that high oil prices are expected to naturally moderate demand growth, which could have a stabilizing effect on the economy. This statement does not explicitly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather describes an economic condition that could have self-correcting effects. It does not indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,These geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging potential negative impacts on economic growth due to geopolitical events. This implies a concern for slower economic activity, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth, aligning with a dovish outlook."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, indicating no significant change in the economic conditions or outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather implies a steady state of economic conditions."
1,"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee expressing readiness to adjust policy as necessary to support economic growth and maintain price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a willingness to respond to changing economic conditions to achieve its goals."
2,"The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests uncertainty in assessing inflation pressures, which means the FOMC might be in a wait-and-see mode, neither clearly indicating an imminent policy change to counteract inflation nor suggesting that inflation is well-contained and might warrant an easing of policy."
1,Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that an active monetary policy addressing financial instability might lead to excessive risk-taking, which could increase the likelihood of future crises. This suggests a cautious stance towards easing policies, as it acknowledges the potential negative consequences of being too accommodative. Such a view typically aligns with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing financial imbalances and inflation rather than stimulating the economy."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad objectives that guide the Committee's actions."
2,"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a challenge in evaluating the current level of economic slack and acknowledges uncertainty regarding different indicators of excess demand. It does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a complex economic environment that the FOMC must consider. This reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions without a clear indication of a policy shift in either direction."
2,"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses potential questions and implications regarding the management of inflation within a certain range, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects considerations about how to handle inflation targets and the communication of policy preferences, rather than signaling an immediate policy action."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the importance of understanding the long-run equilibrium real rate to balance aggregate supply and demand over time, considering factors like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the role of the equilibrium rate in guiding long-term policy decisions. The focus is on the theoretical framework for policy rather than immediate policy actions."
1,"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where external factors (resolution of hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices) could lead to positive economic outcomes such as a boost in equity markets, consumer sentiment, and consumer spending. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather discusses potential improvements in economic conditions due to nonmonetary factors. The FOMC might consider these developments in their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation expectations have decreased, the survey-based measures for the long-term have not changed. This suggests a mixed view on inflation, with no clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might interpret this as neither an immediate risk of high inflation that requires a hawkish response, nor a sign of deflation that would warrant a dovish stance. Instead, it reflects a balance between the two, aligning with a neutral monetary policy position."
2,"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation, suggesting that the Committee is concerned about potential inflationary pressures and is ready to act, possibly by tightening monetary policy, to ensure price stability. This vigilance often implies a readiness to increase interest rates if inflationary indicators warrant such action."
0,"Financing conditions in capital markets remained broadly accommodative, supported by low interest rates and high equity valuations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of financing conditions without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy changes. It simply states that conditions are accommodative due to low interest rates and high equity valuations, which could be the result of past policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any imminent adjustments to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral with respect to the FOMC's stance on future policy moves."
2,"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the FOMC members expressing readiness to adjust policy in response to signs of either rising inflation or a weakening economic expansion. This suggests a stance that is neither explicitly geared towards tightening nor easing but rather emphasizes vigilance and flexibility in policy-making to maintain their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call ""changes in discount rates,"" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the factors contributing to variations in financial markets, particularly those unrelated to fundamental economic indicators, such as changes in investor sentiment or risk aversion. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity and the non-fundamental factors that can affect market dynamics. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the potential effects of globalization on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather poses a question regarding the broader impacts of globalization. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not directly relate to immediate policy actions but rather to an understanding of economic dynamics that could inform future decisions."
2,"Because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about high equity valuations potentially leading to risks in the economic forecast, which could imply a readiness to tighten monetary policy to mitigate these risks. The mention of ""asymmetric risks"" and ""nonlinear"" policy responses indicates that the FOMC might take a more aggressive stance in adjusting policy (likely raising interest rates) to address imbalances caused by asset price changes, aligning with a hawkish approach to prevent potential overheating in the economy. This is in line with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and moderating long-term interest rates."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy through this extended period of weakness, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on a sectoral slowdown implies a concern for maintaining employment and stabilizing prices, which dovish policies aim to address."
0,Productivity accelerated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity accelerated"" does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it is a statement of economic observation. Increased productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily adding to inflationary pressures, which could be consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on how this change in productivity affects the overall economic outlook or the FOMC's policy response, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Similarly, measures of underlying inflation continued to be somewhat low relative to levels seen as consistent with the dual mandate over the longer run.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low compared to the levels that the FOMC sees as consistent with its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices over the longer term. This suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation towards the Committee's 2% target, which aligns with a dovish stance."
0,"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the expectations of real short-term interest rates without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It reflects a change in long-term projections rather than an immediate policy stance."
2,"Independence and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, was established as an independent central bank--although, at the time, it was given no clear concept of its role in the conduct of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement about the Federal Reserve's establishment and its initial lack of a clear monetary policy role. It does not provide any current policy stance or indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely describes the Fed's independence and its situation at inception, without any implications for current monetary policy actions."
2,"Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the nature of productivity growth and its effects on demand but does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of economic observation rather than a policy direction. The sentence implies that while productivity growth through rationalization (efficiency improvements) is beneficial, it does not boost demand as directly as productivity growth through increased investment spending. This distinction does not suggest a clear move to adjust interest rates or change the monetary stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests the use of interest rate caps as a tool to reinforce forward guidance, which is a way to manage expectations about the future path of interest rates. By setting a horizon on these caps, the FOMC would be indicating a commitment to a certain policy stance for a specified period. This action is aimed at enhancing the credibility of their policy and reducing concerns about an indefinite expansion of the balance sheet, which could be inflationary. The focus on controlling the yield curve and preventing an open-ended balance sheet commitment indicates a concern for inflation and a desire to maintain control over monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed correlation between the decline in term premiums and the decrease in long-run inflation uncertainty as well as short-term interest rate uncertainty since 1990. This statement is primarily analytical, reflecting on past financial trends without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context for understanding financial market conditions."
2,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, particularly concerning inflation and employment, as the world economy reopens after a period of disruption. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity and unpredictability of the current economic environment. The FOMC is signaling that it is closely monitoring the situation and is prepared to adjust policy as needed, but it is not committing to a specific direction at this time."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of inflation on real income, which is a concern for the FOMC's mandate of stable prices. However, without additional context on the FOMC's response or interpretation of this wage and inflation dynamic, the stance cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish. It simply states a current economic condition related to their goals."
1,"Moreover, substantial gains in productivity were muting the effects of rising labor compensation on unit costs, and vigorous competition in numerous markets was continuing to make it very difficult or impossible for business firms to raise their prices to cover rising costs or enhance profit margins.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite increases in labor compensation, improvements in productivity are offsetting the impact on unit costs, and strong market competition is preventing firms from raising prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that would support maintaining or easing current policy to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate threat of inflation."
0,"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members expect unemployment to stay high and inflation to remain below the Federal Reserve's long-term target for the next few years. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce policies that stimulate economic activity to reduce unemployment and move inflation towards the target rate, which aligns with a dovish stance on monetary policy."
2,"The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, gross domestic product growth is solid, and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) baseline outlook is for a continuation of this performance in 2020.2 At present, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation is running somewhat below our 2 percent objective, but we project that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation will rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of the current economic conditions, noting strong employment, solid GDP growth, and inflation near the target level. It also indicates an expectation that, with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will align with the FOMC's goal. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, aiming to maintain the current positive economic conditions without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. The mention of ""appropriate monetary policy"" implies that the FOMC is prepared to adjust policy as needed to sustain these conditions, but the sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for such adjustments."
1,Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, which is the focus of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). Fiscal austerity refers to government policies that aim to reduce budget deficits, typically through spending cuts or tax increases. While fiscal policy can influence economic conditions that the FOMC takes into account when setting monetary policy, the sentence itself does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a general statement about fiscal policy and does not reflect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
1,"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate to achieve price stability and full employment, which are its core objectives. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather states the overall goals of the institution. This reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fiscal development regarding the budget balance but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely states a fact about the budget outcome compared to expectations, without suggesting any particular monetary policy action. The FOMC's monetary policy decisions are typically focused on employment, inflation, and interest rates, rather than fiscal outcomes like budget deficits or surpluses, although such fiscal conditions can indirectly influence monetary policy decisions."
0,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern about inflation not reaching the target level in a consistent and balanced manner. This suggests that the FOMC may consider policies to stimulate the economy to drive inflation towards the target, which is typically associated with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy."
2,But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects uncertainty or complexity in interpreting how asset prices affect the broader economic outlook, which does not suggest a clear policy action. It implies a balanced view, acknowledging the challenges in assessing economic indicators, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a downward revision in the growth forecast for real GDP, which suggests a recognition of some economic softening, particularly in the construction sector. However, it does not directly imply an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The statement is simply an observation of economic conditions, which could be one of many factors the FOMC considers when determining future policy actions. It reflects a balanced view without a clear bias toward either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about economic conditions, specifically productivity growth. Increased productivity can potentially lead to non-inflationary growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on how this productivity growth affects the overall economic outlook or monetary policy adjustments, the stance remains neutral."
0,"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite economic strengthening, job growth remains weak and there is considerable slack in the labor markets. This suggests that the FOMC may be more inclined to ease monetary policy to stimulate employment, aligning with their commitment to maximum employment. The lack of pressure on the labor market could also imply that there is less concern about inflationary pressures arising from wage growth, which would support a dovish stance."
2,"Money versus Interest Rates For most of the post-World War II period, monetary economists have vigorously debated whether the Fed should target money or interest rates in setting policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a historical debate among economists about the focus of the Federal Reserve's policy tools, rather than indicating a current policy stance or future policy direction. It does not provide information on current economic conditions or the FOMC's current policy intentions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the broad set of factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy. The inclusion of various factors such as public health, labor market conditions, and inflation expectations indicates a comprehensive and measured approach to policy assessment, in line with the FOMC's commitment to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant drop in core consumer price inflation, which suggests that inflationary pressures are decreasing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for easing to support economic activity, as lower inflation is typically associated with weaker economic conditions. The FOMC might consider such data as a reason to maintain or lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a theoretical viewpoint on market efficiency and asset pricing, rather than directly indicating a current or future stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather reflects a perspective on how markets might function in theory. This statement does not provide information on the FOMC's actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the FOMC's target, partly due to lower energy prices. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since inflation is not a current concern, and there may be room for easing to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the target level."
1,"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of inflation trends, with an expectation of a modest increase from a very low rate. It does not explicitly suggest a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the inflation situation. The use of ""modest increase"" and ""very low rate"" implies that inflation is under control and within a manageable range, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement seems balanced and does not lean towards a particular policy change, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"On balance, while the business investment outlook seemed vulnerable to somewhat greater than projected weakness in the short run, the members were persuaded that, against the background of large continuing gains in structural productivity and cost savings from further investment in equipment and software, business firms were likely to accelerate their spending for new capital after a period of adjustment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there is some short-term concern about business investment, the FOMC members believe that structural productivity gains and cost savings will eventually lead to increased capital spending by businesses. This indicates a balance between recognizing potential short-term weakness and anticipating longer-term improvement, without a clear immediate direction for monetary policy adjustment. It neither explicitly suggests a need to tighten nor ease the monetary policy but rather conveys an expectation of future economic conditions that could be self-correcting."
0,"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively providing liquidity to financial systems under stress, which is typically a sign of a more accommodative monetary policy stance aimed at supporting the economy during times of financial strain. However, the context of ""what we did today"" suggests that this action is a response to current conditions, which could be interpreted as a proactive measure to prevent further economic downturn or financial instability. This kind of intervention often precedes or accompanies tighter monetary policy to control inflationary pressures that can arise from such liquidity provisions, especially if the economy is close to or at full employment. Therefore, the sentence leans towards a HAWKISH stance, as it implies the Fed is taking steps that could lead to tightening if the provision of liquidity starts to affect inflation or other economic indicators."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic conditions without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy changes. It acknowledges the strengthening labor market and moderate rise in economic activity, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus the stance is neutral."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges factors that could impact the economy, such as oil prices, but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on the assessment of the economic situation rather than on specific policy actions."
1,"In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that economic activity and labor demand have been growing at an unsustainable rate, which could lead to increased inflation unless the policy is tightened. This suggests a stance in favor of raising interest rates or otherwise reducing monetary accommodation to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
1,"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical perspective on the cause of rising oil prices in the 1970s, attributing it to a perceived permanent shift in global demand and supply balances. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the FOMC's current policy actions or intentions. It is simply an assessment of past events and their perceived causes, without a clear link to present monetary policy decisions."
0,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition where residential construction activity is strong, and this is partially attributed to recent declines in mortgage interest rates. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it simply states an observation about the housing market and its relationship to interest rates, without suggesting a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity"" does not provide any clear indication of a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It seems to be a general statement about economic behavior without any direct implications for the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not specifically address employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the core concerns of the FOMC when determining their policy stance."
2,"One of the things we’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called “hysteresis.” And I raised the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""hysteresis,"" which refers to the possibility that a recession can have a long-term negative impact on an economy's potential output. It also raises the question of whether the opposite might be true. This is a theoretical observation about economic behavior during and after recessions, rather than a direct statement about current monetary policy or future policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather reflects on economic phenomena that could influence policy decisions. The stance is neutral as it does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy."
0,"When the government runs deficits, it siphons off private savings (reducing national saving), leaving less available for capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic concept related to fiscal policy rather than directly indicating the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It explains the potential impact of government deficits on national saving and capital investment but does not suggest a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC's monetary policy decisions would be based on how such fiscal situations affect their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes characteristics of fixed exchange rate systems, specifically currency boards and dollarization, in terms of their rigidity and the cost associated with exiting these systems. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or suggest any imminent changes to the policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides a general statement about exchange rate regimes, which does not inherently signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general effects of surprise monetary policy actions on stock prices without indicating a current or future direction of policy. It explains that a surprise tightening of policy would raise the risk premium and lower stock prices, while a surprise easing would lower the risk premium and raise stock prices. This is a statement of fact about the relationship between monetary policy and financial markets, rather than an indication of the FOMC's current policy stance or future intentions."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is slack in the economy, with resources not being fully utilized, which is expected to lead to a decrease in core price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is anticipated to moderate on its own due to underutilization. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with a preference for lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,"The labor market improved in August, and the unemployment rate edged down to 5.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been an improvement in the labor market with a decrease in the unemployment rate, which is a positive sign for the economy. However, it does not explicitly suggest a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The improvement aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but without additional context on inflation or other economic indicators, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the sentence is classified as neutral."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is planning to remove policy accommodation, which could be interpreted as a move towards a tighter monetary policy (hawkish). However, the use of the phrase ""balanced approach"" and the reference to the longer-run goals of maximum employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent suggest that the Committee is aiming to carefully manage the transition in a way that does not unduly disrupt the economy. This implies a commitment to a gradual and measured adjustment of policy, which is neither overtly hawkish nor dovish but rather indicates a neutral stance that is responsive to economic conditions."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to data-driven and transparent policy-making. The projections themselves could lead to any policy stance depending on their content, but the sentence does not provide information on the nature of these projections or their implications for monetary policy."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for certain economic conditions (related to employment and inflation) to be met before raising interest rates (""liftoff""), combined with a tool (yield curve caps) to manage interest rates at different maturities. This approach is balanced and conditional, not explicitly indicating an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a readiness to adjust policy in response to the achievement of the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not in itself signal a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants expect inflation to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as transitory factors dissipate and labor market conditions improve. This expectation suggests that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate to achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment, without explicitly signaling a need to tighten or ease policy in the immediate future. It reflects a balanced view that the economy is moving towards the Committee's targets as expected."
0,We want to see lower unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""We want to see lower unemployment"" suggests a focus on stimulating economic activity to reduce unemployment, which aligns with a dovish stance. This implies that the FOMC may favor policies that ease monetary conditions, such as lowering interest rates or other expansionary measures, to support job creation and move towards maximum employment, one of their key objectives."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite expectations of moderate real growth, the speaker believes this growth will not be sufficient to reduce core inflation. This implies a concern for persistent inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from staying above the target level. The stance is therefore hawkish, as it indicates a potential need for measures to cool down inflationary pressures."
0,"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to continue purchasing Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace. This action is aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of the markets for these securities, which is a form of monetary easing. By doing so, the FOMC is fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, which typically involves lowering interest rates or making credit more available to stimulate economic activity. This aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests measures to support the economy rather than to restrict it, which would be more characteristic of a hawkish stance. The decision to maintain or increase asset purchases is often taken in response to concerns about economic weakness or below-target inflation, both of which are key considerations for the FOMC in achieving its mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities. This action is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. The aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity suggests that the FOMC is taking measures to ease monetary policy in order to promote economic growth, consistent with a dovish stance. This is particularly relevant when the economy is facing a downturn or when there is a risk of falling short of the FOMC's employment and inflation objectives."
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation has increased, partly due to higher oil and gasoline prices. This observation suggests that inflationary pressures are present, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
1,"With capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential inflationary pressures due to high levels of capacity utilization and rapid inventory investment, which, if combined with stronger-than-expected demand, could strain resources. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to cool down economic activity and keep inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"If we—if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a cautious approach to responding to inflation data, suggesting that the FOMC would not necessarily react to what it perceives as transitory influences on inflation. This implies a wait-and-see attitude, which is neither explicitly suggesting tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced stance, focused on analyzing data thoroughly before making a policy decision, in line with the FOMC's commitment to informed and measured policy adjustments."
0,Participants pointed to potential interactions between financial stresses and the housing market contraction as the primary source of continuing downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for downside risks to economic growth, stemming from financial stresses and a contracting housing market. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support growth and mitigate these risks, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating the economy over tightening monetary policy to combat inflation."
1,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that with interest rates already low, the central bank has limited room to maneuver in the event of additional negative demand shocks. This suggests a bias towards raising rates or at least maintaining them at the current level to preserve the ability to cut rates in the future if needed, which is a tightening stance in monetary policy."
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is no significant wage-induced inflation pressure, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy. The absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization indicates that the economy might not be overheating, and therefore, there may be no immediate need to increase interest rates to combat inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally associated with maintaining or reducing interest rates to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a concern."
1,"Such second-round effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure 1).","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is an increase in the relative price of energy, it is not expected to lead to a rise in long-term inflation expectations, suggesting that the current situation does not warrant a change in monetary policy. The statement is balanced, acknowledging a potential risk (higher energy prices) but also noting that this risk has not materialized into a broader inflationary concern, which would require a policy response. Therefore, it does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies that the conditions are expected to improve without the need for tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and potentially allows for a more accommodative policy approach."
2,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a natural moderation in economic growth due to a projected slowdown in inventory investment. This does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a factor that could influence economic activity. It reflects an observation of economic conditions without a clear bias toward a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and help drive inflation towards the target level."
2,"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the approaches to monetary policymaking, noting a trend in the reliance on forecast-based methods among leading central banks. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the methodology of policy formulation. The focus on forecasting suggests a data-driven approach to policy decisions, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making but does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to raise interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. This action is typically taken to control inflation and suggests a stance towards preventing the economy from overheating, aligning with the goal of stable prices. The speaker's comfort with raising rates despite a large balance sheet implies a focus on controlling inflation over stimulating the economy, which is a hawkish position."
2,"Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply reports on the performance of stock price indexes and bank stocks, without suggesting any particular action or implication for monetary policy adjustments. This information might be part of the broader economic context the FOMC considers, but it does not in itself reflect a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation due to past experiences. This statement is more of an observation on economic behavior and historical context rather than a direct indication of current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy by the FOMC."
0,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some members of the FOMC were in favor of easing monetary policy because they observed contained unit labor costs and inflation expectations, alongside evidence of economic weakness. This suggests a preference for a more accommodative policy stance to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,"Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a proactive approach to tightening monetary policy in anticipation of potential inflation, even before it becomes evident. This indicates a stance towards preventing inflation from rising above the target level, which aligns with a tightening or contractionary monetary policy approach, typically considered hawkish. The focus on preemptive action to ensure sustainable economic growth by addressing inflation risks before they materialize demonstrates a commitment to price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market reaction to an economic data release (the U.S. employment report for May) and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports on currency movements in response to new information, which does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of policy. The FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates are not directly addressed in terms of policy action in this sentence."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reflection on the Federal Reserve's past success in achieving its inflation target, rather than an indication of current or future monetary policy actions. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the long-term inflation goals of the Federal Reserve."
2,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general understanding of the timing of monetary policy effects on the economy and financial markets without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It acknowledges the lag between policy implementation and its impact on output and employment, while noting the immediate effect on financial markets, but does not suggest whether the policy is becoming more restrictive or more accommodative."
1,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a potential scenario where there is stronger growth in investment, which could positively affect incomes and overall spending. This could be seen as a positive economic development that might not require immediate monetary policy action, as it does not specify whether this growth is causing the economy to overheat (which might be inflationary and thus require a hawkish response) or if it is simply a sign of economic health (which could be consistent with a neutral policy stance). The sentence reflects an acknowledgment of economic factors that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions, but it does not in itself advocate for a particular policy action."
0,"Some of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to expectations of more expansive fiscal policy, another upside risk.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there is an upside risk to inflation due to expectations of more expansive fiscal policy, which could lead to an increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices. This suggests that there might be a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
0,"Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that several members of the FOMC are concerned about potential negative risks to economic growth and inflation, which suggests a tendency towards easing monetary policy to support the economy and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term target. This dovish stance implies a readiness to maintain or introduce more accommodative measures if necessary to counteract the perceived downside risks."
1,"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the potential negative impact of higher inflation on economic growth in the longer term. This suggests that the FOMC might favor a tightening of monetary policy to prevent high inflation from harming long-term growth, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that with the economy nearing full employment, there is an increased likelihood of stronger inflation outcomes due to potential fiscal stimulus. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to control inflation, consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the positive outcomes of stable prices, which align with the FOMC's goal of price stability. It does not directly indicate a future action to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather affirms one of the core objectives of the FOMC. Stable prices contribute to the broader economic goals of the FOMC, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy stance."
0,"Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that a decrease in house prices could lead to a reduction in consumer spending, which might negatively impact employment and income, further reducing the demand for housing. This scenario suggests a potential slowdown in economic activity, which could warrant a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment and stimulate demand, aligning with a dovish approach."
1,The shifting balance of domestic demand and potential supply in each country means that policies affecting domestic demand will need to be re-calibrated to preserve price stability and keep economies operating at high levels of reserve utilization.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the need for recalibration of policies to maintain price stability and high levels of resource utilization, which suggests a balanced approach to adjusting monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing but rather an adjustment to changing economic conditions to achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
2,"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a retrospective analysis of the performance of economic indicators during a past recession, specifically discussing the effectiveness of the Stock-Watson indicator and other interest rate-based indicators in signaling the 1990-91 recession. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather reflects on the historical accuracy and timeliness of certain economic indicators. This analysis is part of the FOMC's ongoing assessment of economic conditions and does not suggest an immediate policy action."
2,That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the economy can sustain low levels of unemployment without triggering inflationary pressures. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, as the labor market conditions are not leading to upward pressure on prices. The stance is therefore dovish, as it indicates a potential for maintaining or easing monetary policy rather than tightening it."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of inflation expectations without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy action. It suggests that stable inflation expectations can help maintain low and stable inflation, but it does not directly imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on the importance of public expectations in achieving the FOMC's inflation target, rather than on current economic conditions or policy adjustments."
0,"When we reach maximum employment, when we reach a state where labor market conditions are at maximum employment in the Committee’s judgment, it’s very possible that the inflation test will already be met.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the conditions for considering a tightening of monetary policy (i.e., raising interest rates) may soon be met, as both the employment and inflation objectives of the FOMC are close to being achieved. The reference to ""maximum employment"" and the ""inflation test"" being met suggests that the FOMC is prepared to act to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,Many participants commented that measures of short-term inflation expectations were elevated or that far-forward measures of inflation compensation were near the upper edge of their historical range.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants are observing elevated short-term inflation expectations and that far-forward measures of inflation compensation are near the upper edge of their historical range. This suggests a concern about higher inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back towards their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from rising too quickly."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past decision by the FOMC to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime after a period of careful study. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a strategic choice regarding the framework for conducting monetary policy, which is aimed at achieving the FOMC's broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments, such as raising or lowering the federal funds rate, which would be necessary to classify it as hawkish or dovish."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth, with an increase in private domestic final purchases and a turnaround in inventory investment, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy. It simply provides an economic forecast without suggesting whether the FOMC will respond with tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that current inflation expectations are stable enough that fluctuations in energy prices do not significantly impact core inflation, and therefore do not necessitate a strong monetary policy response. This suggests a balanced view where the FOMC does not see a need to either tighten or ease policy specifically due to energy price volatility, as it would have in the past. It reflects an understanding of the current economic conditions without indicating a clear direction for policy change."
2,"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses fiscal policy goals related to government budgeting and entitlement program reforms, rather than directly addressing monetary policy or the stance of the Federal Reserve regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary tools. It does not provide clear indications of a move to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it is more focused on long-term fiscal sustainability rather than immediate monetary policy actions."
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technological trend regarding the price of computing power and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation on technological progress and cost efficiency, which may indirectly affect productivity and economic conditions but does not in itself dictate a specific monetary policy action."
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in focus from concerns about rising inflation to concerns about economic weakness. This suggests that the FOMC is more worried about a slowing economy than about high inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth. Moving away from a focus on inflation (which would be associated with a tightening bias) to a focus on economic weakness typically implies a dovish tilt, as it may involve lowering interest rates or implementing other measures to stimulate the economy."
0,"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of fiscal policy measures on household spending, noting that there was an increase in spending associated with stimulus payments and unemployment benefits. It also mentions the temporary nature of these measures and suggests that the future strength of the recovery will depend on further fiscal support. This statement is primarily descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges the role of fiscal policy in the economic recovery, which is separate from the FOMC's monetary policy tools. The sentence does not provide clear signals about adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy actions."
0,"Just as in the earlier analysis of Ammer and Freeman, this analysis suggested that in all three countries the inflation targeting led to a drop in inflation and nominal interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of inflation targeting in three countries, noting a reduction in both inflation and nominal interest rates. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance by the FOMC, such as tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of past outcomes associated with a particular monetary policy strategy (inflation targeting). The sentence is factual and does not suggest a clear direction for future policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the perception of congressional support or indifference towards inflation targeting, which is a strategy for monetary policy. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. It merely comments on the possible interpretations of congressional behavior, which is external to the FOMC's own policy stance."
0,"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the state of productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It neither indicates a need to tighten policy (which would be hawkish) nor suggests an easing of policy (which would be dovish). Instead, it provides an assessment of economic conditions related to productivity, which is one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement is more about the economic outlook and does not directly tie to actions on interest rates or other monetary policy tools."
2,That is a positive for growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That is a positive for growth"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states that something (unspecified in the sentence) is beneficial for economic growth. Without context on what is driving the growth or how it relates to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, it's not possible to determine whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of policy. The sentence does not directly address inflation or employment levels, which are key considerations for the FOMC when determining a hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the statement is classified as neutral."
2,"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the uncertainty in determining the exact levels of output and employment that the economy can sustain without leading to inflation or other issues. This reflects a balanced view that is consistent with the FOMC's approach to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators and acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in economic forecasting."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence lists various factors that can influence the economy and monetary policy decisions, such as interest rates, risk spreads, currency values, the stock market, and credit availability. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish."
0,"""4 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.5 Concluding Remarks While economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not forget that full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the new framework as an evolution in strategy, but it emphasizes that the core goals of maximum employment and price stability remain unchanged. It also recognizes the ongoing economic recovery while noting that there is still significant progress to be made. This statement does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather maintains a balanced view on the current economic situation and the Federal Reserve's objectives."
1,"Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by “jawboning,” guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policymakers are prepared to use additional tools to combat and control inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of ""price and wage controls"" and other measures to prevent inflation from rising implies a willingness to take action, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a balanced approach to achieving the stated goals."
2,"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical or empirical relationship between inflation and various economic factors, including lagged inflation, resource utilization, and the price of certain imports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy but rather explains some of the elements that might influence inflation. This understanding helps the FOMC in making informed decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation in the household sector regarding mortgage debt and home-price appreciation without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates a potential slowdown in the housing market but does not explicitly connect this to inflation or employment levels, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC. Therefore, it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of economic condition regarding productivity levels. Low productivity could have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral. It does not inherently suggest an immediate need for policy adjustment in either direction."
1,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Broaddus believes a tightening of monetary policy (which usually means increasing interest rates) is necessary due to strong aggregate demand. Tightening policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate during the 1988-90 period, stating that they were not especially surprising or anomalous. This statement does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reflects a retrospective assessment of economic conditions without suggesting any immediate policy action. It is neutral in terms of monetary policy stance because it does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy decisions."
0,"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where the growth in the monetary base and M2 (a measure of the money supply) is projected to be in line with the growth in nominal GDP. This indicates a neutral stance as it suggests that the monetary policy is set to neither stimulate nor restrict economic growth excessively, but rather to grow in tandem with the economy. This alignment with GDP growth does not explicitly signal an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy, but to maintain a balance consistent with the economy's performance."
1,"In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where stable inflation expectations are aiding the central bank in maintaining low inflation while also providing the flexibility to respond to economic disturbances. This reflects a balanced view, suggesting that the central bank has the ability to manage inflation effectively without indicating a clear direction towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the central bank's role in stabilizing the economy while maintaining its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of the housing market, noting improvements in activity and a rise in house prices, but also acknowledges variability across regions. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reports on economic conditions without suggesting an immediate need for policy adjustment. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring various economic indicators, which can inform future policy decisions, but in itself, it does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC believed its current monetary policy stance was appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects at the time of their meeting. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the existing policy settings in relation to the economic outlook. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
2,"I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the relationship between economic slack (unused economic capacity) and inflation is weak, implying that even if there is slack in the economy, it may not be leading to lower inflation as might be traditionally expected. This could be interpreted as a dovish stance because it indicates that there may be room for the economy to grow without generating significant inflationary pressures, reducing the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy. The FOMC might use this assessment to justify maintaining lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been expanding at a good pace, which implies that there is not much slack (unused capacity) in the economy. This could lead to inflationary pressures, and therefore, it might be necessary to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to slow down the pace of economic expansion to maintain stable prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will base future policy adjustments on incoming economic data related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a data-dependent approach that does not inherently lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The stance is balanced and contingent on how the economic outlook evolves, reflecting a neutral position in terms of monetary policy."
2,"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence explicitly states that the technical measures being discussed do not equate to a change in the stance of monetary policy. The continuation of implementing policy through adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate indicates a steady approach, without signaling a shift towards either tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced or status quo position in line with their ongoing policy strategy."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential approach to managing inflation (""flexible inflation averaging"") and suggests it could be beneficial and easier to communicate compared to a formal average inflation targeting rule. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather discusses a method of inflation management. It reflects a consideration of how to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices without explicitly signaling a move towards more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t change rapidly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an acknowledgement of the gradual nature of inflation dynamics without suggesting any immediate action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an understanding that inflation trends are not subject to rapid changes, which implies a steady approach to policy without a clear bias towards hawkish or dovish stances."
2,"In Japan, private consumption rebounded strongly, and private investment and net exports continued to boost growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in Japan, focusing on the positive aspects of private consumption, investment, and net exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments or signal a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on international economic developments, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC when making policy decisions. However, without a direct link to the implications for U.S. monetary policy, the stance remains neutral."
1,"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the actual unemployment rate may be higher than the reported headline unemployment rate due to adjustments for labor force participation and misclassification. This suggests that the labor market is weaker than it appears, which could justify a more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance to support employment, one of the FOMC's key goals. The comparison to the peak unemployment rate following the Global Financial Crisis, a period of significant economic stress, further underscores the potential need for easing policies to achieve maximum employment."
0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a slowdown in output and employment, the Committee expects that with appropriate policy accommodation (which typically means keeping policies easier or introducing measures to stimulate the economy), economic activity will continue to grow and labor market conditions will improve. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in order to support the economy and move closer to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains a mechanism of how economic conditions might affect financial variables."
2,It’s where we always want inflation to be heading.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It’s where we always want inflation to be heading"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general goal or target for inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's objective of maintaining stable prices. Without additional context on whether this direction implies an increase or decrease in inflation towards the 2% target, or how the FOMC plans to respond, the stance cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
0,"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes the effects of an ""unanticipated monetary ease,"" which typically means a loosening of monetary policy. However, the context in which this is presented suggests that it is not the current stance but rather a theoretical scenario. The mention of lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports generally aligns with a dovish stance. Yet, the use of this example in the FOMC statement could imply a caution against such easing due to potential inflationary pressures or other risks, which would be a hawkish perspective. Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact stance, but the reference to the consequences of easing suggests a warning or a lesson against it, which leans toward a hawkish interpretation."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that could affect its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to economic conditions, which is a neutral stance. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals, without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy adjustment."
0,Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing evidence of productivity growth from microeconomic studies, which is an economic observation rather than a direct indication of a future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about the economic context in which the FOMC operates, rather than a clear signal of their policy intentions."
2,"Most Committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Committee members' views on the usefulness of structural models for understanding changes in the inflation process and aiding in inflation forecasts. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a methodological approach to analyzing economic conditions. The focus is on the tools used to gauge inflation rather than on specific policy actions to address it."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, showing that the FOMC is attentive to inflation trends, which is consistent with their mandate for stable prices. The commitment to monitoring suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed, but the sentence itself does not reveal a bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation related to adjusting the level of reserves in the banking system due to seasonal fluctuations in demand. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather refers to routine adjustments that ensure the smooth functioning of the monetary system throughout different times of the year. These adjustments are a normal part of central bank operations and do not inherently signal a change in the overall direction of monetary policy."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy might be growing at a very rapid pace, the fastest since 1983. Rapid economic growth can lead to inflationary pressures, which the Federal Reserve might counteract with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Therefore, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, as it implies the potential need for measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that monetary policy might be used to turn a temporary decrease in inflation into a permanent one. This suggests a potential easing of policy to ensure that inflation does not fall too far below the target level, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and prevent deflation."
0,"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a structural economic issue related to labor market dynamics and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges the impact of technical change on the labor market, which is a factor outside the direct influence of monetary policy. The focus is on the need for adaptation by workers rather than on immediate policy actions by the FOMC to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of stronger real GDP growth due to various supportive factors, including fiscal policy changes, confidence levels, credit availability, financial conditions, and foreign economic growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic environment that could influence future policy decisions. The statement is balanced and does not suggest immediate action to either increase or decrease the federal funds rate."
0,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants in the FOMC have adjusted their views on the appropriate path for policy due to concerns about slower global growth and tighter credit conditions. This shift suggests a move towards a more cautious or restrictive policy stance to address potential risks to the economic outlook, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening credit conditions and slower growth could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent any potential overheating or financial instability, aligning with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising energy and commodity prices leading to higher inflation and lower growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates to manage inflationary pressures, even at the potential cost of slower economic growth."
0,"So, you know, I can’t—all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is monitoring economic conditions, specifically ""weak global growth,"" which is a factor in their decision-making process. However, the sentence does not explicitly suggest a direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing), nor does it provide information on how this observation might influence the FOMC's actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary tools. It simply states that global growth will be a consideration, which is a neutral stance in terms of policy direction."
1,"After the stock-market decline that began in March 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there was a decline in stock-market activity leading to reduced capital investment and a lower demand for financing globally. This suggests an economic slowdown, which would typically lead the FOMC to consider easing monetary policy to stimulate investment and economic activity, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"What I’m telling you is that the stance of monetary policy we have today, we believe, is appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current stance of monetary policy is considered suitable by the speaker, suggesting that there is no immediate need for a change in policy to either tighten or ease. This reflects a balanced view that the current policy is aligned with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where industrial production is increasing due to higher final demand and a reduction in the excess inventory, which indicates an alignment with economic growth and does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it could be seen as a sign of a healthy economy responding to market conditions. The statement is simply reporting an economic development without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5."" does not provide a complete context or direction for monetary policy. An increase in the unemployment rate could be interpreted as a sign of a weakening labor market, which might suggest a dovish stance if the FOMC were to consider easing policy to stimulate employment. However, without additional context on the reasons for the increase or its implications for inflation and long-term interest rates, it is not possible to determine a clear policy direction. Therefore, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors are leading to an improvement in exports, which is generally positive for the domestic economy. However, it does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The improvement in exports could potentially lead to higher economic growth and employment, aligning with the FOMC's goals, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate need for a policy adjustment. It simply provides an observation of the current economic conditions without a direct implication for monetary policy actions."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the balanced and data-driven process of considering various economic indicators. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to its goals of maximum employment and price stability without suggesting a particular policy stance."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for delaying the tightening of monetary policy due to less robust labor market conditions and uncertainty about the inflation outlook. This suggests a cautious approach, leaning towards maintaining or easing the current policy stance rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish position. The FOMC is signaling that they are not yet confident enough in the economic indicators to begin increasing interest rates or reducing monetary accommodation, which would be actions associated with a hawkish stance. Instead, they are opting to wait for more information, which is indicative of a dovish approach to support employment and ensure that inflation moves towards the target rate in a stable manner."
0,"The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an assessment of economic conditions, specifically regarding productivity and potential growth, without directly suggesting an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a concern about economic performance which could have implications for both employment and price stability, but it does not in itself indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. The FOMC might consider this information when deciding on monetary policy, but the sentence alone does not advocate for a specific policy stance."
2,"In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if long-term interest rates do not adjust as expected, short-term interest rates may need to increase more significantly to influence long-term rates and economic activity. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy more aggressively to achieve the desired economic outcomes, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if long-term interest rates do not adjust as expected, short-term interest rates may need to increase more significantly to influence long-term rates and economic activity. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy more aggressively to achieve the desired economic outcomes, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants are concerned about the economy operating near its potential, which could lead to tighter resource markets and increased inflation pressures. This suggests a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply describing a method for measuring inflation, specifically the 12-month change in core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices, which is a common indicator used to assess the underlying rate of inflation. It does not indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a neutral, informative statement about one of the tools the FOMC uses to monitor inflation in relation to its goals."
2,"As you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement describing what the federal funds rate is and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply explains the mechanism through which the FOMC influences monetary conditions, without suggesting any particular direction of policy change."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. activity was revised upward, suggesting an improvement in economic conditions. This could imply that the economy is performing better than expected, which may lead to increased inflationary pressures. In response to stronger economic activity, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
2,"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting growth near the economy's potential and balanced risks, with inflation remaining constrained. This suggests that they do not see a pressing need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently, as conditions are seen as neither overheating (which would be inflationary and warrant a hawkish stance) nor cooling excessively (which would increase unemployment and warrant a dovish stance). The use of terms like ""averaging,"" ""more balanced than earlier,"" and ""inflation would remain constrained"" reflects a stance that is neither aggressively aiming to counteract inflation nor to stimulate the economy, but rather to maintain the current policy path."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate (by 50 or 100 basis points) would not significantly dampen investor optimism regarding the profitability of emerging technologies. This implies that the speaker believes monetary policy tightening (higher interest rates) would not have a desired effect on certain economic behaviors, which in this context, indicates a stance that is more inclined towards a tighter monetary policy despite its potentially limited impact on specific areas of the economy. The mention of ""easy money"" not driving expectations also hints at a view that current monetary conditions are not excessively loose, which aligns with a hawkish perspective that does not see the need for further easing."
1,"It was possible, though, that investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the uncertainty in inflation prospects, which does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of market sentiment rather than a clear indication of a policy shift. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexity of interpreting market signals without committing to a specific policy direction."
2,"In my comments today, I will focus on the Fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it emphasizes the Fed's commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability in the face of economic upheaval. The mention of learning from history and focusing on incoming data suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where decisions will be based on the evolving economic landscape and risks, rather than a predetermined path towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a model that links the behavior of real GDP and key interest rates, which is a technical statement about economic modeling rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy stance."
2,The external sector was projected to continue to support domestic economic activity throughout the forecast period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the external sector is expected to positively contribute to domestic economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance. It simply provides an outlook on one aspect of the economy without specifying whether this will lead to tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the external sector is expected to positively contribute to domestic economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance. It simply provides an outlook on one aspect of the economy without specifying whether this will lead to tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the target level of 2 percent. This suggests that if inflation is currently below the target, the FOMC is inclined to adopt policies that could increase inflation, which typically involves lowering interest rates or other expansionary measures. However, the commitment to raising inflation to a specific target can also imply a willingness to tighten monetary policy if inflation is projected to rise above the target, to prevent it from overshooting. Given the focus on reaching the inflation target, the stance can be interpreted as hawkish because it shows a readiness to act against low inflation, which could involve a tightening of policy if inflation expectations were to increase significantly."
2,"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the complexity of inflation dynamics and suggests that there are multiple factors influencing inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not commit to either a tightening or easing stance but rather reflects a balanced view that there are various elements at play in the inflation process. This suggests that the FOMC is considering all these factors in its policy decisions, consistent with its mandate to maintain stable prices."
2,"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation in the household sector regarding mortgage debt and home-price appreciation without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates a state of the housing market but does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is simply providing information on economic conditions, which is part of the FOMC's role in monitoring various sectors to inform their policy decisions."
0,"And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in December and January, we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures, especially if inflation is running below the FOMC's 2 percent target. This suggests that the Committee would be less inclined to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the desired level."
0,"Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee's employment objective would be sustained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants view the unemployment rate as higher than desired and express uncertainty about the persistence of recent improvements in employment. This suggests a stance that is more inclined towards easing monetary policy to support further job growth and progress towards the Committee's employment objective, rather than tightening policy, which would be more likely if they were confident in the sustainability of employment gains."
0,"M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there have been significant increases in the money supply (M2 and M3), which is a result of recent easing actions by the Federal Reserve. This could suggest that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures that could arise from an expanded money supply, especially if this trend continues. The reference to easing actions affecting market interest rates and investment behaviors shows that the policy has been stimulative, but the focus on ""very large gains"" in money supply could be a precursor to a more hawkish stance to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where GDP growth variance decreased and inflation rates fell from high levels. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past economic conditions, which could be used to inform current policy but does not in itself suggest a particular action."
2,"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where a model predicted deflation based on the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth, but it does not directly indicate what action, if any, the FOMC would take in response. It merely states a fact about the model's prediction and the potential need for judgmental adjustments. This does not clearly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the Committee's stance towards achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3 over a specific period. This action in itself does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a tool for monitoring and guiding economic conditions towards the Committee's goals. The establishment of growth ranges for monetary aggregates is a part of the broader strategy to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without explicitly signaling an immediate intent to raise or lower interest rates."
2,We take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) considers the stock market as one of the factors when assessing the economic outlook and making monetary policy decisions. This statement does not explicitly suggest a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather reflects a balanced approach to incorporating various economic indicators into their decision-making process. The stock market can influence consumer and business confidence and spending, which in turn can affect employment and inflation. However, the sentence does not provide information on whether the current stock market level would lead to a more hawkish or dovish stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism through which monetary policy influences the economy and acknowledges the role of financial markets in reflecting expectations and risks. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the transmission of policy actions to the broader economy. This understanding is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and its use of a range of indicators to inform its decisions."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided to maintain the status quo regarding the tentative ranges for money growth set previously, due to substantial uncertainty in projections. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy, but rather continuing with the established policy until more information becomes available."
2,"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an inflation projection that is within the FOMC's target range of 2% over the long term, suggesting that the current monetary policy stance is aligned with their inflation goals. It does not explicitly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as the projected inflation rate is close to the target and the reference to the previous year's factors (food and energy prices) does not directly suggest a policy change. The sentence seems to be more of an observation or report on inflation expectations rather than a signal of a future policy move."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. Therefore, the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their target of 2% inflation over the long term. The authorization and direction to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions could imply adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to maintain economic stability."
0,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about very low inflation and deflation, which are economic conditions that typically lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. The mention of the costs increasing sharply with intensifying deflationary pressures suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to prevent deflation and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance. This is because deflation can lead to a decrease in consumer spending and investment due to the expectation of falling prices, which can further slow economic growth and make it more difficult to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Thus, avoiding a further substantial fall in inflation should be a priority of monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about preventing a significant drop in inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might prioritize actions to keep inflation from falling too low. This could imply a tightening of monetary policy to ensure that inflation remains close to the target level, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy can involve raising interest rates or other measures to prevent inflation from declining substantially, which is consistent with the goal of stable prices."
1,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is considering further policy firming, which typically means increasing interest rates to address inflation risks. This stance is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level, thus aligning with the goal of stable prices. The mention of ""further policy firming"" suggests a proactive approach to managing inflation, which is a hallmark of a hawkish stance. However, the Committee also notes that the extent and timing of this firming will be data-dependent, indicating a careful and measured approach to policy adjustments."
0,"And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And, and that’s why we have adopted the flexible average inflation-targeting framework"" indicates the adoption of a policy framework rather than a specific policy action. The flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) is a strategy that allows inflation to run moderately above 2% for some time following periods when it has run below that longer-run goal. This approach is designed to be balanced, aiming to achieve inflation and employment objectives over time, and does not inherently signal an immediate intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a commitment to a symmetric inflation goal over the long term, which can be seen as a neutral stance in the context of a single statement."
1,"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation"" seems to emphasize the FOMC's focus on controlling price inflation. This suggests a commitment to tightening monetary policy if necessary to keep inflation in check, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The hawkish tone implies that the FOMC prioritizes its goal of stable prices and is prepared to adjust policy to address inflation concerns, even if that means raising interest rates."
1,"In addition, the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate moved down a tenth to 4.6 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a change in the estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which is a neutral indicator in terms of monetary policy stance. It does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an updated assessment of economic conditions that could inform future policy decisions. The adjustment in the estimate itself does not convey a clear direction toward a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is being kept low due to reduced demand and lower oil prices, which suggests that there is less pressure on the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity, as inflation is not currently a concern."
0,"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses historical estimates of productivity growth and expresses caution regarding the duration of such growth trends. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on economic conditions that could influence policy decisions. The focus on productivity growth rates is more informational and does not suggest immediate action towards changing the monetary policy stance."
2,"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is a weakening in the expansion of expenditures in capital goods, possibly due to an excess in capacity. This observation is more of an economic assessment rather than a direct indication of a future monetary policy action. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the current economic conditions. The mention of a ""surfeit in capacity"" could imply potential concerns about overinvestment or a slowdown, but without additional context on inflation or employment, it's not clear how this would affect the FOMC's policy stance."
0,Consumer price inflation had remained relatively subdued over the summer months.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation has been relatively low during the summer months. This suggests that inflation is not currently a pressing concern, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, subdued inflation may allow for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish policy approach."
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting"" is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate a preference for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a factor (productivity growth) that affects economic forecasting, which is an important consideration for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) when making policy decisions. Productivity growth can impact both employment and inflation, but the sentence does not specify whether this impact would require a more hawkish or dovish response. It simply states that productivity is a complicating factor in forecasting, which is a neutral observation."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are worried about potential inflationary pressures arising from tighter labor markets in the intermediate term. This concern suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an unwanted increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, with the aim of keeping inflation in check."
1,"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants expect that a tightening (""firming"") of monetary policy will be appropriate to bring inflation back to the Committee's 2 percent target while maintaining a strong labor market. This suggests a bias towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about rising inflation expectations, as evidenced by the increase in inflation compensation from Treasury securities. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming unanchored and exceeding their long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is a hawkish stance, as it aims to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is prepared to continue or possibly increase its asset purchases if the labor market does not show significant improvement, provided that price stability is maintained. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further to support employment, which aligns with a dovish stance. The mention of ""price stability"" ensures that this dovish approach is contingent upon not igniting inflation beyond the target, but the primary focus on supporting the labor market indicates a bias towards easing."
0,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite positive developments, there are factors expected to limit economic growth. This suggests a cautious or pessimistic outlook on the economy, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support expansion, aligning with a dovish approach. The focus on restraining factors implies that the FOMC might consider easing policies to counteract these limitations and support their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the historical composition of America's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on the nature of economic growth, which is not directly related to the immediate goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's framework for targeting inflation outcomes that align with their long-term goal of a 2% inflation rate. It does not directly indicate a current or future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather explains the consistency of their actions with the framework established in August 2020. The focus is on maintaining inflation expectations, which is a central aspect of their monetary policy strategy, without suggesting any immediate policy adjustments."
2,"To do this will demand not only greater specialized knowledge, but also an ability to deal with risk and uncertainty.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the need for specialized knowledge and the ability to manage risk and uncertainty, which are general prerequisites for effective monetary policy decision-making. It reflects an understanding of the complexities involved in achieving the FOMC's goals but does not provide specific guidance on the direction of future policy actions."
2,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about economic growth expectations rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic growth. The growth rate mentioned is relatively healthy and does not, in itself, indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while inflation is expected to decrease, it will remain above the FOMC's target of 2 percent by the end of the year. This suggests that the FOMC may need to continue or implement tightening measures to bring inflation back down to the target level, reflecting a hawkish stance on monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other actions to reduce the money supply and demand, thereby putting downward pressure on inflation."
0,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy has not yet achieved the goal of maximum employment, which is one of the FOMC's key objectives. This suggests that there may be room for an accommodative monetary policy stance to support further job growth, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance. The dovish implication is that the FOMC may lean towards easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it until maximum employment is approached."
2,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the benefits of stable prices for all, particularly for those on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution. It reflects one of the FOMC's key objectives—stable prices—but does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it underscores the importance of price stability as a goal, which is a fundamental aspect of the FOMC's mandate."
2,"With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of declining crude oil prices, a temporary and small impact on food prices from a drought, stable long-run inflation expectations, and persistent substantial resource slack. These factors suggest that inflationary pressures are expected to be low, which implies there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The forecast of subdued inflation through 2014 aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests that the FOMC may not need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check, and could maintain or even ease monetary policy to support employment."
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of review rather than indicating a specific direction of policy change. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB) conducting monetary policy framework reviews suggests that they are examining their strategies and tools to achieve their respective goals, which does not inherently signal an intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to assessing and possibly adjusting the policy framework to better meet their objectives of employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations to prevent them from causing instability but does not indicate a current direction of monetary policy action (tightening or easing). It reflects a general principle of monetary policy rather than a specific policy stance."
0,"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a scenario where major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, responded to crises by cutting policy rates to their effective lower bounds, increasing their balance sheets through large-scale asset purchase and lending programs, and providing forward guidance on future monetary policies. These actions are indicative of a dovish stance, as they involve easing monetary policy to support the economy during times of financial stress. The measures mentioned are designed to inject liquidity into the financial system, lower borrowing costs, and signal a commitment to accommodative policy for an extended period, all of which are consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that high inflation could be more persistent, which implies a risk that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures. This aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates."
1,"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about the price of oil and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The statement is simply providing context on energy prices, which is one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The impact of oil prices on inflation and economic activity is complex and can have both inflationary and growth-impacting consequences, but the sentence itself does not prescribe a policy action."
1,"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates expectations of strong economic growth leading to a rapid decrease in unemployment rates, which could potentially overshoot the FOMC's maximum employment goal. This scenario often leads to concerns about the economy overheating and the potential for inflationary pressures, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target. The projected path of GDP growth above trend and the falling unemployment rate suggest a robust economy that may require a hawkish response to keep inflation in check."
0,"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is recognizing a correction in equity prices, which suggests a potential slowdown in economic activity, including consumer spending and business investment. This observation could be a precursor to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The FOMC might be inclined to raise interest rates or take other measures to tighten policy in response to these signs of economic exuberance, to ensure price stability and moderate long-term interest rates, even if it could potentially lead to a short-term decrease in employment."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about high core inflation levels, despite a modest improvement. Their emphasis on the need for ""further moderation"" suggests that they would support measures to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation down towards their target level. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy and address inflation concerns."
1,Higher productivity growth has apparently increased aggregate demand through at least three channels.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the positive effects of higher productivity growth on aggregate demand, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic factors that could influence their decisions. The impact on employment, inflation, and interest rates is not explicitly stated, so the policy stance remains unclear from this sentence alone."
2,"However, in the view of most members, the outlook for both economic activity and price pressures remained very uncertain, and thus the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was quite unclear.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are uncertain about the economic outlook and price pressures, which suggests they are not signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of future policy actions reflects a balanced approach, without a clear inclination towards a hawkish or dovish stance. This aligns with a neutral monetary policy position, where the Committee is likely to carefully monitor economic indicators before committing to a specific policy direction."
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth influenced by several factors, including accommodative monetary policy, which suggests a continuation of current policy rather than a shift towards tightening or easing. The mention of ""accommodative monetary policy"" indicates a supportive stance that is already in place, but the focus on gradual improvement and the combination of factors at play does not signal a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish position. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of fostering maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a change in policy direction."
0,"Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015, while falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1/4 percentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10 Finally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views regarding the debt's sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of past economic factors that influenced GDP growth and core inflation, specifically mentioning the impact of net exports and non-oil import prices, as well as a general statement about federal government debt sustainability. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather discusses economic conditions and their effects. This type of historical analysis or context setting is typically considered neutral in terms of monetary policy stance, as it does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy."
0,"On balance over the intermeeting period, interest rates on private instruments registered small mixed changes while yields on longer-term Treasury securities declined significantly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observed changes in interest rates and yields without explicitly indicating a future policy action or a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy. The mixed changes in interest rates on private instruments and the decline in yields on longer-term Treasury securities could be the result of various factors, including market expectations and economic data, rather than a direct result of FOMC policy decisions. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the FOMC views these changes as a reason to adjust monetary policy in a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to take action to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, even if it means causing some economic pain in the short term. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy typically involves raising interest rates to control inflation, which can lead to a restraint on economic activity. The sentence indicates a priority on controlling inflation over short-term economic growth, which is characteristic of a hawkish approach."
2,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the factors being discussed do not have significant long-term implications for inflation or the overall American economy. This indicates a view that the current situation does not warrant a change in monetary policy to either tighten or ease, as there is no perceived impact on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a noticeable increase in both short- and long-term inflation expectations according to survey measures. Rising inflation expectations can signal potential inflationary pressures, which the Federal Reserve might counteract with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Therefore, the statement suggests a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider actions to prevent inflation from rising above their target."
1,"However, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC members on the need for a ""slight tightening"" of monetary policy. This action is aimed at containing inflation and preventing imbalances that could harm the economy's performance. The reference to ""tightening resource constraints"" and the desire to ""raise the odds on containing inflation"" suggests a proactive approach to managing inflationary pressures, which aligns with a hawkish stance that typically involves increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent overheating."
2,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the monetary policy was in line with the Taylor Rule, which is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, but it also states that the nominal federal funds rate remained unchanged. This suggests a balance between following a rule-based approach and maintaining the status quo, which does not clearly signal a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not explicitly indicate a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of labor market conditions, particularly focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor force participation of prime-age women with children and the distribution of job losses across industries. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges in the labor market that could have longer-term economic implications. The statement is descriptive of the current economic situation and the potential risks to economic growth and employment, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"In 1951, the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord freed the Fed from the obligation to support Treasury bond prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement regarding the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951, which granted the Federal Reserve independence from the Treasury in setting monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides context on the institutional framework that allows the Fed to pursue its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates independently."
2,"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about credit access, particularly in the subprime mortgage market, without directly indicating a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an immediate concern for inflation that would warrant a hawkish stance, nor does it imply a need for a dovish policy to stimulate the economy. Instead, it simply notes an increase in credit availability, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stances."
2,"But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S. economy is hovering close to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus, that the unwelcome surge in inflation this year, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the current spike in inflation is temporary and that the underlying inflation rate is close to the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This implies that the Committee may not see an immediate need to tighten monetary policy aggressively, as they expect inflation to settle back down after the short-term disruptions are resolved. The use of ""largely transitory"" to describe the surge in inflation indicates a view that the current inflation pressures are not persistent and therefore do not warrant a hawkish response."
2,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a goal of returning the economy to a state of low unemployment and inflation near the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an objective the FOMC might aim for."
0,"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential long-term trends in real interest rates based on economic theory, productivity growth, and demographic changes. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of underlying economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on equilibrium levels of interest rates in the context of productivity and demographic trends suggests a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
2,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand."" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It merely states a reason for an economic condition, which could be related to either inflation or employment issues. Without additional context on whether the FOMC intends to address this misalignment with tighter or looser monetary policy, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. It is a neutral statement that acknowledges an economic situation that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions."
2,We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970sâ€”not a happy story.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to historical events and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests caution based on past experiences but does not provide information on current or future policy actions."
2,"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on maximum employment, indicating that it aims for a sustainable level that does not lead to economic overheating. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving one of its goals—maximum employment—without explicitly suggesting a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It implies a focus on stability rather than a change in policy direction."
2,"Yet as research has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and corporate bonds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the limited explanatory power of economic fundamentals on asset prices, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects an understanding of the complexity of financial markets and the factors that influence asset prices, without suggesting a particular direction for policy adjustments."
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a phenomenon that affects the economy, specifically mentioning the movement of asset prices, including equities and residential real estate. It does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges factors that the FOMC monitors in the context of its broader economic objectives. Asset price movements can be a reflection of various economic conditions, but without additional context on whether these movements are seen as positive or negative, or how they might influence the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
0,"Investor perceptions of a somewhat less accommodative tone of Federal Reserve communications, as well as the softer-than-expected reading for the April CPI, likely contributed to the decline in inflation compensation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that investors perceive the Federal Reserve's communications as less accommodative, which suggests a shift towards a tighter monetary policy stance. Additionally, the mention of a softer-than-expected inflation reading for April (CPI) in conjunction with this perception implies that despite lower inflation, the Fed is communicating a less supportive approach, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. This could mean that the Fed is focused on preventing inflation from rising above its target, even if recent data shows it to be lower than expected."
0,"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is below the Committee's target of 2 percent, partly due to lower energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. This suggests that there is less upward pressure on inflation, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy and possibly more room for easing to stimulate the economy and move inflation towards the target."
0,"Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a significant amount of unused resources (e.g., labor, capital) in the economy, which implies slack in the economic system. The concern expressed is about ""further disinflation,"" which indicates a trend toward decreasing inflation rates, moving away from the FOMC's target inflation rate of 2%. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that aim to stimulate economic growth and prevent deflation, such as lowering interest rates or other forms of monetary easing. The sentence implies that if the economy does not expand as expected, there is a risk of inflation rates falling even further, which would likely prompt the FOMC to consider easing monetary policy to support economic growth and push inflation towards its target level."
2,"When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, in large part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that long-term interest rates are rising due to expectations of higher short-term interest rates, which typically occur when the central bank is expected to tighten monetary policy to manage inflation or economic overheating. This suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary policy stance, aligning with the goals of price stability and moderation of long-term interest rates."
2,"We include these types of price terms today in our forecasting equations, and they are important to forming our views of the inflation outlook and thus to the policy process.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the inclusion of certain price terms in forecasting equations, which are important for forming views on the inflation outlook and influencing the policy process. This statement is factual and procedural, indicating the use of data in policy formulation but not signaling a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It reflects the Committee's commitment to informed decision-making based on economic indicators, consistent with its goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices, but we have continued to analyze the effects of changes in interest rates, for example, on decisions like investment or car purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's ongoing analysis of how interest rate changes affect economic decisions such as investment or car purchases. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for future monetary policy adjustments (tightening or easing) but rather reflects a balanced approach to understanding the impact of monetary policy on the economy. This analysis is part of the Committee's routine assessment of economic conditions to inform their policy decisions."
0,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is concerned about inflation falling below their target, which suggests they would be inclined to take measures to prevent this, such as tightening monetary policy to ensure inflation reaches or stays at the desired level. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing too low inflation, which could signal a readiness to act against downward pressures on prices."
2,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that despite low unemployment leading to higher wages, companies are not passing these costs onto consumers through higher prices, which suggests that inflationary pressures are not intensifying. This could indicate that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current policy to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months, but year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in consumer prices recently, the overall annual inflation rate is still very low. This suggests that inflation is not a current concern and implies that there may be less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures. The FOMC might therefore lean towards maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic activity, as long as inflation remains subdued and does not threaten their long-term target of 2%."
0,"They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity and employment levels are still recovering and have not reached the levels seen at the beginning of the year. Additionally, it mentions that weaker demand and lower oil prices are keeping consumer price inflation down. This suggests that there is no immediate concern for inflation overshooting the target, and the economy might still need support, implying that there is less need for tightening monetary policy and more room for accommodative measures to stimulate economic activity and employment."
2,"Required down payments, usually about half of the home's purchase price, excluded many households from the market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition of the housing market that affects household participation, specifically the barrier to entry due to high down payment requirements. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities declined over the intermeeting period while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities were roughly unchanged, which left inflation compensation noticeably lower.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding Treasury yields without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It notes a decline in nominal Treasury yields and unchanged yields on inflation-indexed securities, leading to lower inflation compensation. This information is more about market conditions than a clear signal of the FOMC's intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest actions the FOMC might take in response to these observations, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a methodological approach to analyzing the impact of FOMC policy decisions on financial markets. It does not indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather explains how the Committee assesses the immediate effects of its announcements on financial markets. This is a procedural statement focused on the timing and interpretation of market reactions, rather than a comment on the stance of monetary policy itself."
2,"Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes mixed economic conditions, with strong housing demand on one side and weaker business investment and variable consumer spending on the other. This suggests a balanced view of the economy without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might see the strong housing demand as a positive sign, while the weak business investment and fluctuating consumer spending could be seen as areas of concern, but overall, the sentence does not lean towards a specific policy action."
2,"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a biographical note about Palmer and her views on unemployment statistics. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a perspective on the complexity of labor market indicators and their use in policy decision-making."
0,"And, of course, despite the improvements seen in the May jobs report, the unemployment rate, at 13.3 percent, remains historically high.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights that, despite some improvements, the unemployment rate is still at a historically high level. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce measures to stimulate the economy and improve employment figures, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support maximum employment."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members anticipate a scenario where increasing employment could lead to slower productivity growth, resulting in higher unit labor costs and potential upward pressure on prices. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is currently low and any increase in inflationary pressures is expected to rise slowly. This suggests that there is no immediate concern for inflation to overshoot the target, which would typically prompt a tightening of monetary policy. The mention of strong demand against the backdrop of stable financial conditions implies that the economy is performing well without generating significant inflation, which could justify a more accommodative stance or at least no rush to tighten policy. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, as it suggests there is room for maintaining or easing monetary policy without risking the FOMC's inflation target."
2,"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a general overview of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities, including maintaining financial stability, supervising and regulating banking organizations, overseeing the nation's payment system, and conducting monetary policy aimed at stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. It does not directly indicate a specific direction of monetary policy tightening or easing, but rather describes the broad functions and historical context of the Federal Reserve's actions."
1,"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes strong demand and a very tight labor market as contributing factors to inflation pressures. The mention of removing ""extraordinary monetary policy accommodation"" suggests that the FOMC is considering tightening monetary policy to address these inflationary concerns. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy and bring inflation back towards the target level."
2,"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically that firms are increasing production in response to higher demand, which is expected to contribute to economic recovery. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic situation. It suggests a balanced view of economic developments, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance. The FOMC may use such information to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy adjustment."
2,Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the market's reaction to the FOMC's communications, stating that there was little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. This indicates that the communications were likely perceived as consistent with existing expectations and did not signal a clear shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced or status quo situation rather than a change in policy stance."
2,"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where housing activity decreased but then showed signs of improvement due to a decline in mortgage rates. This indicates a response to changing economic conditions rather than a clear direction in monetary policy. The improvement in housing demand could be seen as a positive sign for economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's monitoring of economic indicators without a clear bias towards either hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the Committee's 2 percent objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent target, suggesting that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation to the desired level. It implies that there may be less need for tightening and more need for easing to ensure that inflation expectations align with the Committee's objective. This dovish stance is in line with efforts to avoid deflationary pressures and support the economy in reaching the target inflation rate."
0,Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an expectation regarding fiscal policy and its impact on economic growth. This statement is more of an economic outlook rather than a clear indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC will adjust the federal funds rate or alter its monetary policy stance to counteract the effects of fiscal policy on economic growth."
1,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC are observing signs of tight labor markets and increasing labor compensation, which are often precursors to higher inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tighter monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to cool down economic activity and prevent inflation from rising above the target level."
2,"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic context and the effects of global trade, competition, and productive capacity on American businesses and consumers, without directly indicating a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges factors that influence inflation and employment but does not suggest a specific policy action."
2,"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of inflation expectations as a factor in monetary policy assessment, without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC considers inflation expectations alongside other variables like the natural rate of unemployment (u*) and the neutral rate of interest (r*) when making decisions. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without a clear bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is still significant slack in the labor markets, implying that a decrease in unemployment would not lead to substantial inflationary pressures. This indicates that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support employment without risking the FOMC's inflation target, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's consideration of ways to improve the transparency of their economic outlook and policy judgments through the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on communication strategies. The discussion of enhancing the SEP is about providing clearer information to the public and does not inherently suggest a shift in policy direction."
1,"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distributionâ€”for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes ongoing supply chain issues, including production bottlenecks, input shortages, poor crop yields, and transportation challenges, which are contributing to rising prices. This scenario suggests inflationary pressures that the FOMC might address by tightening monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices. The mention of driving up prices indicates concerns about inflation, which is typically countered with hawkish measures."
0,"In contrast, a few participants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of inflation expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern that inflation measures and expectations are still below the Committee's 2 percent target. This suggests that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation towards the desired level, rather than tightening policy, which would be more consistent with a hawkish stance. The focus on achieving the inflation objective implies a willingness to maintain or introduce measures that would support price increases, aligning with a dovish policy stance."
1,"The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of market conditions where the federal funds rate was higher than expected due to a temporary increase in demand for reserves, rather than indicating a deliberate change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It does not explicitly suggest a future tightening or easing of policy, but rather reports on an event that affected short-term interest rates."
0,"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of past currency movements and their correlation with trade balances, rather than indicating a future direction of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on how differences in interest rates between the U.S. and other countries have historically affected the dollar's value and trade dynamics."
0,"The upswing in M2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing, which boosted liquid deposits over this period, though M2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors contributing to the growth in the money supply (M2), attributing it to both temporary effects of mortgage refinancing and increases in nominal income. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of recent economic developments. The statement is factual and does not suggest a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides information about the composition of the staff supporting the Board's monetary policy responsibilities but does not indicate a direction for monetary policy (tightening, easing, or maintaining current levels). It neither suggests an imminent change in policy nor comments on the current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of fiscal policy in influencing economic growth through various means such as affecting national saving, incentivizing work, saving, investment, and public investment in human and physical capital. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, but rather discusses the impact of fiscal policy measures, which are separate from the monetary policy tools the FOMC directly controls."
1,Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is a concern about the potential conflict between the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the Treasury's debt management. The Federal Reserve is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. This could involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down growth and control inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The concern arises because reductions in Treasury debt supply, which could lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates, might counteract the Fed's efforts to tighten monetary policy. Lower long-term rates can stimulate economic activity, which is opposite to the Fed's intention if it is trying to cool down the economy."
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current policy range is considered appropriate for the economic growth and inflation forecasts provided by the members. It suggests that the current monetary policy stance is aligned with the expected economic conditions, implying neither an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor for easing (dovish). The statement reflects a balanced view, consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability, without signaling a clear direction for future policy changes."
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the nature of recessions following asset-price booms and busts, which is more of an analytical or research-oriented question rather than a direct statement of policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather suggests an interest in understanding economic phenomena that could inform future policy decisions. The focus is on gaining insights into economic patterns, which is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators."
2,"However, equity prices subsequently retraced some of the earlier declines as concerns about trade policy seemed to ease and corporate earnings reports for the first quarter of 2018 generally came in stronger than expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where equity prices recovered due to easing concerns about trade policy and stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports. This observation is more of a commentary on market conditions rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral. The sentence reflects the FOMC's awareness of economic indicators but does not in itself imply a shift in policy direction."
0,"The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current stance of monetary policy is accommodative, which means it is designed to stimulate economic growth. This is typically associated with lower interest rates and is intended to support further improvement in labor market conditions and help inflation return to the FOMC's target of 2 percent. An accommodative policy stance is generally considered dovish because it suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing economic growth and employment over concerns about rising inflation."
2,"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are difficulties for corporate borrowers to raise funds at reasonable prices or at all, which suggests a tightening in financial conditions and potential stress in credit markets. This could imply a need for monetary policy easing to support the flow of credit and prevent a negative impact on employment and economic activity, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"But in our new century, the simple notion of price has turned decidedly ambiguous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any clear indication of a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general observation about the complexity of defining 'price' in the current economic context, which does not directly suggest a change in policy stance."
