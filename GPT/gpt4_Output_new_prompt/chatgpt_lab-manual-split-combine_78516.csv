2,Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests the use of interest rate caps in combination with forward guidance as a tool to control the yield curve, which implies a strategy to manage interest rates actively. This approach would be used to prevent the market from expecting long-term, open-ended monetary easing, thereby signaling a commitment to prevent excessive inflation and maintain control over the monetary policy. This can be interpreted as a hawkish stance because it indicates a readiness to use policy tools to limit lower interest rates and maintain price stability, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights a significant shortfall in employment compared to pre-pandemic levels, which suggests that the economy is not operating at full capacity. This could imply that the FOMC might lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to stimulate economic activity and job creation, in line with its commitment to maximum employment. The focus on employment shortfall aligns with a dovish approach, as it indicates a need for supportive policy measures to address the gap in labor market recovery."
1,The shifting balance of domestic demand and potential supply in each country means that policies affecting domestic demand will need to be re-calibrated to preserve price stability and keep economies operating at high levels of reserve utilization.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there may be a need to adjust policies to control domestic demand in order to maintain price stability and ensure that economies operate efficiently. This suggests a potential tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of inflation trends, noting that inflation was receding from its 2008 level and aligning with previous forecasts. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of past inflation data relative to expectations."
2,"In Japan, private consumption rebounded strongly, and private investment and net exports continued to boost growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in Japan, specifically noting positive trends in private consumption, investment, and net exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments or signal a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on international economic developments, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC when making policy decisions."
2,"What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to inflation management, suggesting that the FOMC would be equally concerned with inflation rates persistently above or below their target. This implies a commitment to both preventing inflation from rising too high and ensuring it does not stay too low, consistent with their goal of price stability around the 2% inflation target. It does not explicitly signal an immediate intent to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a stance of vigilance and symmetry in their response to deviations from the target."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, indicating no significant change in the economic conditions or outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather implies a steady state of economic conditions."
2,"market-based measures of inflation compensation over the next five years, as well as over the five-year period beginning five years ahead, moved down further over the intermeeting period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation expectations for both the short and medium term have decreased. This suggests that market participants are anticipating lower inflation, which could imply that there is less pressure for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Lower expected inflation is consistent with a dovish stance, as it may lead to maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic activity and employment."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of observation regarding economic conditions abroad, which could potentially impact the U.S. economy and thus influence the FOMC's policy decisions. However, without additional context on how this outlook would affect the FOMC's policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, it remains a neutral statement. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the monetary policy stance."
0,"In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the currency market, noting the appreciation of the dollar against AFE (Advanced Foreign Economies) currencies due to differing monetary policy expectations and political uncertainty in Europe. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. It reflects the Committee's awareness of external economic factors that can influence the U.S. economy but does not suggest a specific policy action."
1,"But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual situation regarding the United States' trade deficits and external debt but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on the economic conditions that may influence the FOMC's future decisions. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a change in policy to achieve these goals."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges factors that could impact the economy, such as oil prices, but does not suggest whether these would lead to a tightening or easing of policy. The focus on uncertainties implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,They continued to expect that inflation would move up toward the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term as the effects of these transitory factors waned and conditions in the labor market improved further.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects inflation to align with their target as temporary factors dissipate and labor market conditions improve. This expectation suggests a belief in the current policy's effectiveness in reaching their goals without explicitly signaling a need for immediate policy tightening or easing. It reflects a balanced view that is neither overtly hawkish (suggesting tightening) nor dovish (suggesting easing)."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering international developments and the growth prospects of trade partners as part of their economic forecast, which suggests a balanced approach to policy-making. It does not explicitly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather shows attentiveness to a broad range of economic indicators that could impact their policy decisions. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where investment spending by corporations has grown faster than their retained earnings, leading them to seek additional funds through capital markets. This observation is a neutral statement of economic conditions and does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reports on corporate behavior regarding investment and financing without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to maintaining low and stable inflation, suggesting that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to take action (potentially tightening monetary policy) to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation from rising above the target level."
0,"Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC participants on the long-term normal federal funds rate being lower due to secular trends affecting real interest rates. This observation does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges underlying economic conditions that influence the setting of interest rates. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment rather than a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in the short term."
0,"Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current disinflationary effects (a reduction in the rate of inflation) might not last and could potentially reverse, leading to higher inflation in the future. This implies that the FOMC might need to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent a potential increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance that focuses on controlling inflation and maintaining price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"Signs of an actual change in inflation were still quite tentative and anecdotal, and they did not warrant an adjustment to policy at this meeting.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the evidence of inflation change is not strong enough to justify a change in monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC does not see an immediate need to tighten policy to combat inflation. This implies a stance towards maintaining or easing the current policy rather than tightening, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC members' observation of economic conditions, specifically noting the strength in household spending and its role in balancing weaker areas of the economy. It does not directly indicate a move to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic factors that are relevant to their decision-making. The mention of ""moderating the weakness"" suggests that while there are areas of concern, there are also areas of strength, which supports a balanced or neutral view on the stance of monetary policy."
0,"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees the public health crisis as a negative factor impacting economic activity, employment, and inflation, suggesting that the economy is facing headwinds. This view is dovish because it implies that the FOMC may be inclined to implement or maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and counteract the adverse effects of the crisis. The mention of ""considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term"" further reinforces the likelihood of a dovish approach to ensure progress towards the goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,Households' longer-term inflation expectations also edged up in both November and December.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that households' expectations for inflation in the long term have increased, which could suggest a concern for rising inflation. If inflation expectations are rising, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of its key mandates. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing high inflation."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a recent improvement in economic activity, attributing the change in part to external factors like weather conditions. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of recent economic developments, which is a typical component of FOMC statements used to contextualize their policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards raising or lowering interest rates or adjusting its asset purchases, which would be necessary to classify it as hawkish or dovish. It simply states a fact about economic growth without a clear policy direction."
0,"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that an increase in productivity is having a disinflationary effect, which could be interpreted as reducing inflationary pressures. However, the statement does not explicitly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather describes an economic condition. It implies that the current monetary policy might be adequate to maintain stable prices, one of the FOMC's goals, without the need for immediate action to either tighten or ease. The sentence reflects an observation of economic dynamics rather than a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment."
0,"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Kocherlakota believes the Committee's forward guidance is not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing measures to raise inflation to the 2 percent target. His dissent suggests that he advocates for a more accommodative policy stance to address inflation that is persistently below the desired level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices without suggesting immediate action to adjust the policy stance."
1,"A variety of indicators, along with anecdotal reports, suggested that employment was expanding at a fairly good pace and labor compensation was rising moderately.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment is growing steadily and labor compensation is increasing at a moderate rate. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, where there is neither significant concern about overheating (which would be hawkish) nor about underperformance (which would be dovish). The use of ""fairly good pace"" and ""moderately"" implies that the current situation is in line with the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices without necessitating a clear shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,A few participants particularly stressed the high uncertainty associated with the expected future path of the unemployment rate and commented that the unemployment rate could rise by considerably more than in the staff forecast.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty regarding the future path of the unemployment rate, suggesting that there could be a significant increase in unemployment. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a cautious approach to monitoring economic indicators, which is consistent with a neutral stance where the FOMC is neither signaling an imminent policy change nor committing to maintaining the current policy. It highlights the FOMC's focus on employment as a key indicator for policy decisions, but without a clear implication of how this uncertainty might translate into action."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical economic cycles and the causes of past downturns, specifically noting that financial imbalances, rather than inflation in goods and services, were elevated at those times. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or a future policy action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides context and an analysis of past events, which could be used to inform current or future decisions. The focus on financial imbalances rather than inflation suggests a concern for overall financial stability, which is a component of the FOMC's mandate, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite expectations of moderate real growth, the speaker does not believe this growth will be sufficient to reduce core inflation. This implies a concern for persistent inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from staying above the target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that high inflation could be more persistent, which implies a risk of inflation running above the FOMC's target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence explicitly states that the technical measures being discussed do not equate to a change in the stance of monetary policy. The continuation of implementing policy through adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate indicates a steady approach, without signaling a shift towards either tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced or status quo position in line with their ongoing policy strategy."
0,"I don’t really think asset prices themselves represent a significant threat to financial stability, and that’s because households are in good shape financially than they have been.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a view on the state of financial stability and the condition of household finances, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments such as changing interest rates or altering the pace of asset purchases. The speaker is commenting on the strength of household finances and their ability to withstand potential fluctuations in asset prices, which is a factor in the overall economic assessment but does not in itself suggest an imminent policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
1,"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive effect of globalization on monetary policy, emphasizing the shared value of price stability among central banks, academics, and the public. It does not directly indicate a current or future change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather highlights a consensus on the importance of stable prices, which aligns with the FOMC's long-term inflation target. The sentence does not provide specific information on the direction of policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the macroeconomic data has been stronger than expected, with a significant rebound in GDP growth. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to strong economic data, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
2,"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of balanced-budget requirements at the state level, which is a fiscal policy matter rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an example of how deficit targets can be implemented in fiscal contexts."
2,"with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic situation with a strong job market, increasing incomes, and high consumer confidence, which indicates that the fundamentals for household spending are robust. This statement does not explicitly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of the current economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maximum employment and could be seen as consistent with stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but it does not in itself indicate a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"However, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households' scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concerns about the translation of higher household wealth into consumer spending, which is a consideration of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of a future policy move. It acknowledges potential limitations in household income growth and the behavior of households regarding equity and housing wealth, which could impact consumer spending. This analysis does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather points to uncertainties that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff's projection for the growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down a bit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a revision in the economic forecast without explicitly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It simply states that the staff's projection for GDP growth has been adjusted downward slightly, which could be due to a variety of factors. This information alone does not suggest whether the FOMC will respond with a tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it does not directly reference inflation pressures or employment changes. It is a factual update on economic conditions, which the FOMC will consider among other data when determining the appropriate policy stance."
1,"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about consumer behavior in response to changes in home values, noting that homeowners typically experience a modest and persistent rise in home values, which they perceive as largely permanent. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a comment on the economic behavior related to household wealth and does not suggest immediate implications for adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
1,core CPI inflation remained low.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""core CPI inflation remained low"" suggests that inflation is not rising significantly, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This stance is dovish because it indicates that the FOMC may not need to increase interest rates aggressively if inflation is under control, aligning with the goal of stable prices without the immediate need for a more restrictive monetary policy."
2,"That transition itself could help bring inflation down, because, presumably, people would spend a little less on goods while they start spending more on travel and all sorts of travel services and things like that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential shift in consumer spending patterns from goods to services, which could naturally help reduce inflation. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather suggests that changes in consumer behavior could contribute to the FOMC's goal of price stability. The statement is more of an observation of economic dynamics than a clear signal of future policy actions."
2,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it indicates that the speaker considers the equity market as one factor in the broader context of monetary policy decision-making. This reflects a balanced approach, considering various economic indicators without suggesting a particular policy action."
2,success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation that the outcomes (presumably of some economic policies or conditions) were similar regardless of whether countries were explicitly targeting inflation. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards a need for policy adjustment in either direction. It reflects an analysis of past performance rather than a prescription for future policy moves."
2,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about consumer spending and housing demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy. It suggests a slowdown in the growth of spending on consumer durables compared to the previous period and a modest increase in housing demand, which are observations of economic conditions rather than indications of policy adjustments. The statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of certain economic sectors."
2,The unwinding in the early months of 1997 of special factors that had boosted net exports in the fourth quarter of 1996 was offsetting some of the effects on production of the persisting strength in domestic demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where negative and positive economic factors are balancing each other out. The ""unwinding of special factors"" that previously increased net exports is being counterbalanced by ""persisting strength in domestic demand."" This suggests that the FOMC is observing both upward and downward pressures on the economy without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, hence the classification as neutral."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that businesses are not increasing prices despite rising labor costs, largely due to strong competition. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The lack of price increases to offset higher labor costs implies that the FOMC might not see an immediate need to raise interest rates to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
2,"Largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding ""new economy"" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there have been significant gains in productivity due to investments in the ""new economy."" This statement is simply an observation of economic conditions and does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It acknowledges a positive economic development, which could potentially lead to various policy responses depending on how it affects employment, inflation, and interest rates in relation to the FOMC's goals. However, without additional context on how these productivity gains are influencing the broader economy or the FOMC's policy response, the stance remains neutral."
2,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of unemployment insurance benefits on the labor market and acknowledges the uncertainty of this impact. It also notes the temporal aspect of these benefits, which are set to expire. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation on a factor that could influence the labor market and, by extension, monetary policy decisions. The focus on the expiration of benefits and its uncertain effect on employment does not suggest an immediate action or change in policy stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that China's fluctuating COVID containment measures, particularly the revival of travel restrictions, are considered an ""upside risk for inflation."" This suggests that there is a risk of higher inflation due to these measures, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures. The FOMC might consider such risks when deciding whether to increase interest rates or take other actions to prevent inflation from rising above their target level."
2,"In contrast, changes in inflation rates in some services categories, such as shelter costs, tend to be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation rates in certain service categories, like shelter costs, are showing persistence. This persistence in inflation could be a concern for the FOMC, as it suggests that inflation is not just a temporary phenomenon in these areas. Persistent inflation may require a tightening of monetary policy to keep price stability in line with the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2%. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a hawkish stance, as it implies a potential need for measures to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched."
2,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between inflation volatility and the inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, as estimated by a specific yield curve model. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a mechanism by which lower inflation volatility could affect bond yields. This is more of an observation of economic conditions and their impact on financial markets, rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions."
0,"Despite a recent uptick in consumer prices, year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that even though there has been a recent increase in consumer prices, the overall annual inflation rate is still very low. This suggests that there is not a significant inflationary pressure that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even ease further to support economic activity without stoking high inflation."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past decision by the FOMC to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime after a period of careful study. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a strategic choice regarding the framework for conducting monetary policy, which is aimed at achieving the FOMC's broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The ample-reserves regime is a technical detail about how the FOMC manages the supply of reserves in the banking system and does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish direction."
0,"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential feedback loop between economic activity and financial markets without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges the interconnectedness of economic factors and financial markets but does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The focus is on the observation of economic dynamics rather than a clear policy stance."
0,The recent strains in financial markets posed additional downside risks to economic growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential negative impacts on economic growth due to recent strains in financial markets. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract these risks and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that favors measures to stimulate economic activity."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the components of multifactor productivity and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a factual statement about the factors that contribute to productivity, which is relevant to the broader economic context but does not suggest any immediate action regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"However, this shortfall partly reflected the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports, and some participants pointed out that, by some measures, the most recent monthly inflation readings had firmed a bit.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are recognizing signs of firming inflation, despite recent declines in energy and non-energy import prices. This acknowledgment of potentially rising inflation could suggest a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding the Committee's long-term target of 2%. The mention of ""firming"" inflation readings implies vigilance against inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"Later in the week, however, market interest rates moved up in response to the release of the minutes of the February meeting and the mention therein of some sentiment for a larger policy tightening than had been undertaken.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market interest rates increased after the release of the FOMC minutes, which mentioned that some members had considered a larger policy tightening than what was executed. This suggests that there was a sentiment within the FOMC for a more aggressive approach to tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to take a measured and balanced approach when it decides to change its policy stance, particularly when it starts to roll back measures that were put in place to support the economy (policy accommodation). The use of the term ""balanced approach"" suggests that the FOMC is neither leaning towards an aggressive tightening of monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor towards further easing (which would be dovish). Instead, the statement reflects a commitment to carefully consider the dual mandate of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation target, which is consistent with a neutral stance. The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for policy change but emphasizes adherence to the FOMC's long-term goals."
0,Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that current financial conditions could negatively impact economic growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to mitigate these risks and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment."
0,"Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is a risk of disinflation due to unused economic resources and potential negative economic developments. This suggests that there may be room for an easing of monetary policy to counteract these disinflationary pressures and support economic expansion, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the adequacy of current techniques to measure inflation in the future, which is a methodological issue rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to the need for improved data measurement to ensure informed policy decisions. The focus is on the accuracy of inflation tracking, which is crucial for making appropriate policy adjustments, but the sentence itself does not reveal a preference for either tightening or easing."
0,"Such a policy would clearly have near-term costs: It would slow the expansion in demand, damp the creation of new jobs, and keep inflation lower than it otherwise would be.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to tighten monetary policy despite the potential negative impacts on economic expansion and job creation. This stance is typically taken to control inflation, even if it means accepting slower economic growth and reduced job creation in the near term. The reference to keeping inflation lower suggests a focus on the FOMC's goal of price stability, which may currently be at risk, prompting a hawkish response."
2,"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee has decided to maintain the same growth ranges for the monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach appears to be balanced and does not explicitly indicate a shift in monetary policy stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation about the relationship between two measures of excess demand and how they tend to behave over an economic cycle. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on current economic conditions that would suggest a change in monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that reflects an understanding of economic patterns without prescribing a policy action."
1,"For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a commitment to long-run price stability is crucial to maintain confidence in dollar-denominated assets and prevent a decline in the dollar's value, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the Federal Reserve may need to maintain or tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of price stability and sustainable growth, which are consistent with its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards raising rates, lowering them, or keeping them the same, hence it is considered neutral."
2,"Two members preferred to leave the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, suggesting that the Committee should wait to raise the target range until inflation moves up closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis or inflation expectations increase.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that two members of the FOMC preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, rather than increasing it, until inflation approaches the 2 percent target more closely or inflation expectations rise. This preference for waiting to tighten monetary policy until there is clearer evidence of inflation aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally associated with keeping monetary policy more accommodative to support economic growth and employment."
2,But is it really true that prices are more responsive to productivity than wages?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the relationship between productivity and prices compared to wages, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening nor easing of policy but rather reflects a consideration or inquiry into economic dynamics that could influence policy decisions in the future."
0,"M2 growth picked up appreciably during December and January, evidently reflecting extra demands for liquidity and safety during the century-date-change period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there was an increase in M2 growth, which is often associated with the money supply, during a specific period due to a higher demand for liquidity and safety. This observation is a factual statement about past economic conditions and does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply reports on the behavior of the money supply during a period where there might have been unusual factors at play (the century-date-change period). The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should take action in response to this change in M2 growth, nor does it provide information on the Committee's stance on future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the forecasting process and the need for consistency across various economic variables in the staff's view of the economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a procedural aspect of how economic forecasts are made to align with the overall economic outlook."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of global factors on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as the improved strength and resilience of the financial system due to better risk management and stronger regulation. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic and financial conditions. The mention of low global rates and demographic changes affecting savings and investment demand is an observation of the economic environment, while the commentary on the financial system's strength is a reflection on regulatory and institutional improvements, neither of which clearly suggests an imminent change in monetary policy stance."
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members perceive significant risks to the economic outlook and believe that lowering interest rates would serve as a precaution against potential economic downturns. This stance suggests a move towards easing monetary policy to support economic activity, aligning with a dovish approach."
0,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is averse to inflation falling below their target. This suggests a bias towards preventing lower inflation, which could imply a willingness to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation at or above their desired level. Tightening monetary policy is generally considered a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent inflation from dropping too low, consistent with the FOMC's goal of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
1,"Potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that delaying policy tightening could lead to more aggressive and disruptive actions in the future to control inflation. It suggests that immediate tightening may be necessary to maintain the credibility of the Federal Reserve's commitment to controlling inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance advocating for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising."
1,Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that businesses in some districts are starting to pass higher input costs onto consumers by raising prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures might be building, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, in line with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an individual's belief that quantifying the price stability objective aligns with the FOMC's dual mandate, but it also acknowledges the complexity of communicating this change. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy, but rather a consideration of how to articulate policy goals. The focus is on the communication strategy rather than immediate policy action, making the stance neutral in terms of monetary policy direction."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states that the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate of maximum employment and price stability are compatible goals in the long run, which suggests a balanced view without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects an understanding that the dual mandate can be achieved over time, without implying immediate action to adjust monetary policy."
2,"After falling steeply before the August FOMC meeting, emerging market equity prices were little changed, on net, over the period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding emerging market equity prices without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports an observation of market conditions, which does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such information in the context of global economic conditions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
0,"Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about the housing market and its potential negative impact on employment, income, and wealth, which are factors that could lead to a weaker economic outlook. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to mitigate these risks, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
2,"October 19, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and Initiatives to Sustain the Flow of Credit to Households and Firms Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols,","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is introductory in nature and does not contain any specific information about the stance of monetary policy. It merely sets the stage for a conversation at a convention and does not discuss monetary policy actions or intentions regarding the adjustment of the federal funds rate or other measures that would influence employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future monetary policy but rather expresses a general economic philosophy regarding market systems and the use of knowledge and information. It does not provide specific guidance on the direction of interest rates, inflation, or employment, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC when determining a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."
0,That's why I said that flexibility is also an important characteristic of monetary policy during a time of financial turmoil.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of flexibility in monetary policy during periods of financial turmoil. It does not directly indicate a leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a readiness to adapt to changing economic conditions to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The focus on flexibility implies a balanced approach that could involve either tightening or easing, depending on the specific circumstances."
2,"October 12, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting: Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a formal greeting and introduction to a speech or conversation at a conference. It does not provide any specific information about monetary policy actions or stances, such as interest rate adjustments or views on economic conditions that would influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. Therefore, it does not indicate a hawkish or dovish stance but is simply a neutral statement."
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the economic situation to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. This reflects a balanced approach, focusing on the assessment of economic conditions to inform policy decisions."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic condition (large current account deficits due to a vigorous domestic import market) without directly suggesting an immediate action in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a potential issue (worrisome implications for the future) but does not indicate a clear stance on how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. The focus is on the trade balance rather than directly on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern among the FOMC members that inflation could increase in the medium term, particularly if labor markets continue to tighten. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent a potential rise in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening labor markets can lead to higher wages, which can then lead to higher inflation, and a hawkish response would be to raise interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from rising above the target level."
2,An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an approach to understanding financial market dynamics, specifically the risk premiums embedded in market prices. This understanding is part of the broader analysis the FOMC undertakes to inform its policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is expected to support a moderate recovery and a gradual decline in unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC is maintaining an easing policy to stimulate economic activity and improve labor market conditions, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The use of the term ""accommodative"" typically refers to lower interest rates and other measures designed to encourage borrowing and spending, which can help in achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices when the economy is below its potential."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering reviewing and potentially innovating its framework to better achieve its symmetric 2 percent inflation goal over time. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, as it does not directly imply an immediate intention to either tighten or ease policy but rather to enhance the effectiveness of their strategy in maintaining their long-term inflation target. The focus on a symmetric inflation target implies a willingness to allow inflation to be above or below the target at times, which is consistent with a neutral stance that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish."
2,"So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an improvement in employment conditions, with faster payroll expansion and a declining unemployment rate, yet acknowledges that unemployment is still higher than desired. This indicates progress towards the goal of maximum employment but does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view of the employment situation, without a clear indication of a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"In the view of a number of members, rapid growth of the monetary aggregates, though it had slowed very recently, was a further indication that financial conditions were not restraining economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members see the rapid growth of monetary aggregates as a sign that financial conditions are not limiting economic activity. This suggests a concern that the economy might be growing too quickly, potentially leading to inflationary pressures, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating. The focus on controlling growth to prevent excess indicates a hawkish stance."
0,"Others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a nuanced view of the labor market, suggesting that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect the labor market's health due to a decrease in labor force participation. This does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a careful assessment of labor market conditions. It reflects a balanced approach to interpreting economic indicators, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decrease slightly as the economy begins to expand, which implies that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures. This could indicate a stance that is more accommodative or leaning towards easing monetary policy, as there is no indication of a need to tighten policy to combat high inflation."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perspective on the unemployment rate is one of uncertainty, with risks perceived as being evenly distributed on both sides of their outlook. This suggests that there is no clear direction for monetary policy adjustments based solely on the unemployment rate, as there is no implied need to either tighten or ease policy to address imbalances in the labor market. The statement reflects a balanced view without a strong bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Inflation has continued to run below our longer-run objective, in part reflecting lower energy prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the FOMC's target, partly due to lower energy prices. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since inflation is not a current concern, and there may be room for easing to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the target level."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that price-level targeting might necessitate a higher short-term inflation rate than what is aimed for in the long term, suggesting a potential need for a tighter monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is generally concerned with controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down economic activity."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low"" suggests that the expectations for future inflation are subdued, as indicated by financial market indicators. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity. The FOMC may interpret low inflation compensation as a sign that inflation is not a current threat to the stability of prices, one of their key objectives."
1,"With today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is raising the nominal federal funds rate to a level where, after accounting for core PCE inflation, the real interest rate becomes positive. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as a positive real interest rate can help to slow down inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability."
2,Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are in a wait-and-see mode, looking to gather more information before deciding on any policy action. This suggests a balanced approach, neither signaling an immediate intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather to observe economic indicators more closely to determine the appropriate future course."
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the economy can sustain a higher utilization rate without triggering inflation, due to increased productivity. This implies a balance between economic growth and inflation control, which is in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather observes a condition that allows for economic growth without inflationary pressure, assuming productivity continues to rise."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth"" does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it describes an economic condition where increased national saving is contributing to economic growth. This statement is more of an observation of economic dynamics rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustments."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants anticipate further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, which is a tool for tightening monetary policy. The expectation of continued economic expansion and strong labor market conditions in conjunction with rate increases suggests a focus on preventing overheating and controlling inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,"Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes concerns about the long-term economic effects of the pandemic, such as potential sectoral restructuring and technological disruption, which could impact employment growth and firms' pricing power. It does not directly indicate an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing but rather reflects a consideration of factors that could influence future policy decisions. The focus is on understanding the economic landscape rather than signaling a specific policy direction."
0,"For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is not yet ready to reduce its asset purchases, suggesting that it is waiting for more significant progress towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This implies a continuation of an accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, which is consistent with a dovish approach. The use of ""substantial further progress"" suggests that the Committee is looking for more evidence of improvement before considering tightening monetary policy through the reduction of asset purchases."
0,"They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflationary pressures are expected to decrease due to a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might not need to tighten monetary policy as much or as soon as it might have if inflation were expected to rise. The mention of a delay in reaching the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective implies that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support the economy until inflation approaches the target level."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is merely referencing a descriptive work about the experiences of transition economies with inflation targets. It does not indicate any specific policy stance or suggest a direction for future policy. It neither implies a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates in the context of the FOMC's goals."
0,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","DOVISH

The sentence implies a concern for inflation being too low, which typically leads to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are a sign of an easing monetary policy stance, as the central bank would be aiming to stimulate economic activity to push inflation towards its target level. This dovish stance is in line with efforts to avoid deflation and ensure that inflation reaches the FOMC's long-term goal of 2%."
0,"remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, which suggests that there is less upward pressure on prices. The reference to earlier declines in energy prices and non-energy imports as contributing factors implies that the low inflation is partly due to transitory or external factors rather than domestic economic overheating. This could imply that there is less immediate need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for a more accommodative stance to support the economy and help push inflation towards the target."
2,"Notwithstanding these developments, some participants cautioned that progress toward the Committee's inflation objective should not be overstated","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that the progress towards the Committee's inflation objective might be perceived as more significant than it actually is. This suggests that some participants are wary of becoming too complacent about inflation, which could imply a bias towards tightening monetary policy to ensure that inflation targets are met. This stance is consistent with a hawkish view, where the focus is on preventing inflation from rising too high, even if recent developments might seem positive."
1,"After precipitous drops in March and April, employment rose strongly in May and June as many people returned to work from temporary layoffs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of employment trends, noting a recovery with strong job gains after initial drops. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on the state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's key concerns. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments but rather reports on economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's mandate."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of strengthening household demand due to increased household wealth and fiscal policy support, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The focus on expected improvements in demand is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,Improved prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China and accommodative monetary policy were cited as driving factors that outweighed weaker-than-expected announcements of corporate earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 and earnings projections for 2019.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors influencing market conditions, including both positive (improved trade deal prospects and accommodative monetary policy) and negative (weaker-than-expected corporate earnings) elements. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context for the economic environment in which the FOMC is making its decisions. The mention of ""accommodative monetary policy"" reflects a current stance rather than a signal for future policy changes."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, suggesting that the Fed is willing to take aggressive measures to control inflationary pressures. This stance typically involves tightening monetary policy, which can include raising interest rates. The reference to ""whatever steps were needed"" implies a readiness to act decisively against inflation, aligning with a hawkish policy stance aimed at ensuring price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of predicting economic indicators and the potential discrepancies between targets and actual outcomes, which is more of a neutral commentary on the difficulties faced in monetary policy implementation."
2,"There is, in my view, a reasonable prospect that each of these two effects will reverse their contributions to inflation over the next couple of years and that balance between them will be important in determining the pattern of core and overall inflation rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the factors contributing to inflation will reverse in the coming years, which suggests a wait-and-see approach. It does not explicitly advocate for immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather points to a balance that will affect future inflation rates. This reflects a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation and prepared to adjust policy as needed to maintain its goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates without committing to a specific direction of policy change at this time."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that falling oil prices are contributing to lower inflation, which suggests that there may be less pressure on the FOMC to raise interest rates to combat high inflation. Lower inflation is typically associated with a more dovish stance, as it reduces the need for tightening monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's price stability goal."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that rising oil prices are expected to lead to higher consumer energy prices, which could contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided to maintain the status quo regarding the tentative ranges for money growth set previously, due to uncertainty in projections. This suggests a balanced approach without a clear indication of moving towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The decision reflects a wait-and-see stance, which is typically considered neutral, as it neither explicitly aims to stimulate the economy (dovish) nor to restrict it (hawkish)."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms their commitment to their dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. The use of the term ""sustainable growth in output"" suggests a balanced approach to fostering economic growth without triggering inflation, which aligns with their long-term inflation target of 2%. The directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions in accordance with this policy does not inherently suggest a hawkish or dovish shift, but rather a continuation of their ongoing policy efforts."
2,"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members' approach to policy-making will be responsive to economic data as it emerges, rather than committing to a predetermined path of tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced approach that could lean either hawkish or dovish depending on future economic indicators, particularly regarding employment and inflation trends. The emphasis on data dependency does not inherently signal an intention to either increase or decrease the monetary policy's restrictiveness, but rather to adjust it in response to the actual economic conditions."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumers' inflation expectations are either decreasing or are at historically low levels. This suggests that inflation pressures may be less than previously anticipated, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, lower inflation expectations could reduce the need for immediate action to increase interest rates, aligning with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing the cost of borrowing to support economic activity and employment."
0,Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that labor costs are not rising and core inflation is decreasing, which suggests that there is no immediate inflationary pressure warranting a tightening of monetary policy. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish policy approach."
2,A few observed that the combination of recent labor market improvements and continued softness in inflation had led them to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members believe that the labor market can sustain lower unemployment without leading to higher inflation. This suggests that they see room for the labor market to improve without the need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance. They are essentially saying that the economy can handle a lower rate of unemployment without triggering the inflationary pressures that might typically warrant a more hawkish, or tightening, response."
2,"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that fiscal policy will be less expansionary but will continue to contribute to economic growth. This statement does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides an assessment of fiscal policy's impact on the economy, which is one of the many factors the FOMC considers when making monetary policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards more aggressive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy measures, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential development of financial market instruments and analytical techniques to measure changes in the general price level, which is more of a speculative observation about future market capabilities rather than a direct indication of current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In their review of the outlook for prices, members noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had shown a slowing in core inflation from the high levels posted earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee's view that a portion of the earlier increase had reflected transitory factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC observed a slowing in core inflation, which they believe aligns with their view that previous increases were partly due to transitory factors. This suggests that the FOMC may not see an immediate need to tighten monetary policy aggressively if they believe inflation pressures are subsiding or are not as persistent as previously thought. The dovish stance is implied by the expectation that less intervention (i.e., rate hikes) may be needed if inflation is already showing signs of cooling down on its own."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy nor comments on the current economic conditions in the United States that would warrant a change in the monetary policy stance. Instead, it provides an observation on the international economic environment."
1,"In addition, the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in the first week of November showed that interest rates on C&I loans were generally little changed while spreads remained extremely wide.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of interest rates and spreads for commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, noting that they are ""little changed"" and that spreads are ""extremely wide."" This information does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the lending environment. The FOMC might use such data to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy stance."
2,Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting a strong labor market and moderate growth in economic activity, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It reflects an observation of the economy's performance relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not suggest imminent policy tightening or easing."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is slack in the economy, with resources not being fully utilized, which is expected to lead to a decrease in core price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is anticipated to moderate on its own due to underutilization in the economy. This dovish stance aligns with a potential easing of policy to support employment and economic activity until resources are more fully utilized."
2,But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the technical aspect of separating changes in nominal value into real quantity and price components, which is a methodological concern rather than a direct indication of monetary policy stance. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly address employment, inflation, or interest rate targets. It is more focused on the measurement and definition challenges in economic analysis."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market movements in Treasury yields and inflation compensation without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It reports observed financial conditions rather than suggesting a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy."
1,"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various positive economic indicators, such as a decline in the cost of business capital, increased orders for nondefense capital goods, gains in productivity, stronger business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs. These observations suggest an improving economic environment, which could potentially support both the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general assessment of economic conditions that could be used to inform future policy decisions. The FOMC might use this information to maintain current policy stances until clearer trends emerge that warrant a change."
1,"the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook for housing activity based on strong economic expansion, income growth, and attractive mortgage rates. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions. The mention of ""relatively attractive mortgage interest rates"" suggests that rates are not at a level that would warrant concern for overheating, nor are they so low as to suggest an immediate need for policy easing. The overall tone is balanced, reflecting an environment that is neither exerting pressure for a change in policy stance nor indicating complacency about potential risks."
2,"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in price inflation, the core inflation (excluding energy) remains relatively subdued. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a strong need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively at this point, as inflation is not far from their target. The statement reflects a balanced view, consistent with a neutral stance on monetary policy."
0,"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to remain subdued due to rising productivity and moderate wage gains, which implies that there may be less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures. This dovish stance indicates a leaning towards easing or maintaining the current policy rather than tightening."
0,"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that household spending is growing slowly and is being held back by several factors, including high unemployment and modest income growth. This suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even to ease further in order to support spending and address the constraints mentioned. The mention of high unemployment aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, and a dovish stance would typically aim to stimulate economic activity to reduce unemployment."
2,We have not seen wage growth pick up.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""We have not seen wage growth pick up"" suggests that there is no significant increase in wages, which typically indicates that inflationary pressures from rising labor costs are not present. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support employment."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes maintaining low interest rates is suitable for the current economic conditions. This implies a stance towards easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach. Lower interest rates are typically used to stimulate economic activity, support employment, and prevent deflationary pressures, which is consistent with a dovish policy stance aimed at supporting growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of price stability and sustainable growth, which are consistent with its long-term objectives. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity is stronger than expected and that inflation pressures may be increasing. This suggests a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing an intention to discuss findings and implications from a review in the context of the FOMC's goals and strategy. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather a communication about policy framework and strategy, which is generally considered a neutral stance. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and does not provide specific information on the direction of future policy actions."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, specifically the performance of equity prices over a period. This statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should adjust the federal funds rate or alter its monetary policy to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide information on inflation trends or employment levels, which are key considerations for determining the Committee's policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation potentially exceeding the 2 percent target by a significant margin (more than 3 percent). The speaker is suggesting that such an overshoot would not be considered ""moderate"" and could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target. This implies a readiness to take action against higher inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The mention of underutilization implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support the labor market and stimulate economic activity, without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally in favor of lower interest rates and other expansionary monetary policies to support employment."
1,"some market-based measures of inflation expectations and inflation risk suggested continuing concern among market participants about the risk of higher medium-term inflation, perhaps reflecting large fiscal deficits and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market participants are concerned about the risk of higher medium-term inflation, potentially due to large fiscal deficits and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. This concern suggests that there is a perceived risk of inflation exceeding the target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider these market-based measures when deciding whether to raise interest rates or take other actions to tighten monetary policy, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In contrast, economic activity declined in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic performance in Japan, noting a decline in economic activity during the third quarter following a period of growth in the first half of the year. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments, such as changes to the federal funds rate, nor does it provide clear implications for the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States. It is simply a neutral observation of economic conditions abroad."
1,"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe the economy is operating near its potential and that strong spending could lead to tighter resource markets and increased inflation pressures. This suggests a concern for rising inflation, which typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of fiscal policy measures on household spending, noting that there was an increase in spending associated with stimulus payments and unemployment benefits. It also acknowledges the temporary nature of these measures and suggests that the future strength of the recovery will be influenced by further fiscal policy actions. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather discusses the state of the economy in relation to fiscal support. It implies that the economic recovery is being supported by fiscal measures, but it does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy by the FOMC. Therefore, it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U. S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on the factors that will influence the timing of economic growth, including containment measures for a crisis (likely a health-related crisis such as a pandemic), the effectiveness of those measures, and the impact of other policies like fiscal policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the various factors that will affect the economy's performance. The focus is on the uncertainty and external influences on economic growth, without a clear direction on monetary policy adjustments."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence lists various factors that can influence the economy and monetary policy decisions but does not indicate a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects an understanding that the FOMC considers a wide range of economic indicators when making decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. To maintain stable prices and achieve its inflation target, the FOMC might lean towards tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and causing inflation to rise above the desired level. The authorization and direction to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions likely refers to the implementation of monetary policy measures consistent with a robust economic expansion, which could include raising interest rates or other forms of tightening."
2,The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that inflation expectations are becoming less anchored, which could signal a risk of higher inflation. In response to rising inflation or unanchored inflation expectations, the FOMC might be more likely to tighten monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices, thus the stance is considered hawkish."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past market reaction to expectations of the Federal Reserve's tapering (reducing asset purchases), which led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility. This reaction, in turn, affected emerging market economies (EMEs) by causing sharp declines in their exchange rates and asset prices. The sentence does not directly indicate a current stance of monetary policy but rather discusses the consequences of market expectations about future policy actions. It does not suggest whether the FOMC is currently inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on the Committee's future actions."
1,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year"" does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of the economic conditions, specifically the strength of economic growth. This could be seen as a positive sign for the economy, which might not require immediate policy action, hence the classification as NEUTRAL. It does not directly indicate whether the FOMC will adjust interest rates or change its monetary policy stance to address inflation or employment levels."
2,"You can get to 20, if you wanted to, easily, but labor force participation, the unemployment rate, different age groups of—you know, prime-age labor force participation, in particular, gets a lot of focus, the JOLTS data get a lot of focus.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses various labor market indicators such as labor force participation, the unemployment rate, and the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the different metrics used to assess the labor market's health. This suggests a balanced approach to monitoring economic conditions without a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while interest rates are low, the cost of servicing debt in relation to homeowners' income remains consistent with historical norms. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation through excessive borrowing nor is it too restrictive, as the debt servicing burden is not unusually high. It reflects a balanced view on the impact of interest rates on the economy, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,"Looking ahead, the projected slowing in the growth of final sales, including the effects of weak export markets, likely would reinforce business efforts to bring the growth of their inventories into better alignment with that of their sales, and such a development should contribute to the projected slowing in overall economic activity in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of a natural adjustment in the economy, where businesses align their inventory growth with sales growth in response to slowing final sales and weak export markets. This is seen as contributing to a projected slowdown in overall economic activity. The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather observes an economic trend that the FOMC might take into account when making future policy decisions. It reflects a balanced view of the economic situation without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in economic growth and a cooling of the housing market, without directly suggesting an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring economic indicators but does not indicate a clear direction for future policy adjustments. The statement is simply providing context and information that will be used to inform future policy decisions, which could be either dovish or hawkish depending on how these conditions interact with the FOMC's goals for employment, inflation, and interest rates."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that threaten its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to economic conditions, which is a neutral stance. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals, without a clear indication towards a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) policy direction."
1,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering additional firming (tightening) of monetary policy to address risks related to inflation and economic growth. The use of the term ""firming"" typically refers to actions such as raising interest rates, which are taken to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The statement suggests that if incoming information shows an adverse evolution of inflation or economic growth, the FOMC may respond with tighter monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation compared to the previous year, due to rising prices in specific sectors such as food and non-energy imports. This expectation of increased inflation could suggest a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too far above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
2,"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process and the level of information sharing among the members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) before policy meetings, particularly those preceding an Inflation Report. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the thoroughness and consistency of the information that informs their decisions. This process-oriented statement reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not provide insight into the direction of policy adjustments."
0,"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the profession's emphasis on it, as well as the stability of current estimates and trend growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather reflects an analysis of economic conditions related to inflation and employment. The focus on NAIRU suggests an ongoing consideration of the balance between employment and inflation, which is a core aspect of the FOMC's mandate, but the absence of significant adjustments to trend growth estimates implies a steady state rather than a signal for imminent policy change."
0,"Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives a greater risk of economic weakness rather than overheating or inflation, suggesting that they may be more inclined to ease monetary policy to support economic growth and prevent a downturn. This dovish stance implies a readiness to lower interest rates or implement other expansionary measures to stimulate the economy and counteract potential weakness."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the existence of significant imbalances in the economy, including labor supply, but also expresses the belief that these imbalances will resolve over time without causing persistent inflationary pressure. This suggests that the FOMC does not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively in response to these imbalances, as they are expected to correct themselves without major economic disruption. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,"The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the effectiveness and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance, as the Committee is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further evaluation of economic conditions. The focus on data dependency and the absence of a preset course for asset purchases reflect a neutral position, with potential adjustments to policy being contingent on future economic developments."
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a phenomenon that affects the FOMC's areas of concern (employment, inflation, and interest rates) but does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It merely acknowledges the impact of asset prices on the economy without suggesting whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The movement of asset prices can have various implications for the economy, and without additional context on whether these movements are causing inflationary pressure or economic slowdown, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish."
0,"First, the significant appreciation of the dollar over the last two years has clearly had an important restraining effect on U.S. inflation, both via the direct effect on the prices of imported goods and on the pricing power of domestic firms producing import-competing goods.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the appreciation of the dollar has been suppressing inflation by making imported goods cheaper and reducing the pricing power of domestic firms. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not a current concern, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. In a dovish stance, the focus might be more on supporting employment and economic growth rather than on countering rising inflation."
0,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected outcome of currency depreciation on the price competitiveness of U.S. exports without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing by the FOMC but rather discusses the effects of exchange rate movements on trade dynamics. This is more of an observation of economic conditions than a signal of policy direction."
2,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing inflation, which suggests that the current or past policy stance has successfully kept inflation in check. This could be interpreted as a justification for maintaining or even tightening monetary policy to ensure continued stability in inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation."
1,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that interest rates are increasing, which is typically a sign of tightening monetary policy. The acknowledgment that prices will adjust, potentially rising less rapidly, and that debt-service obligations will increase, suggests measures are being taken to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to cool down the economy and achieve stable prices."
2,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the underlying economic theory, suggesting that the basic interactions between demand, supply, and expectations remain consistent despite recent trends in globalization. This statement is more about the understanding of economic mechanisms than about immediate policy action."
0,And we were actually quite concerned that growth was not sufficient to continue to bring the unemployment rate down.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about insufficient economic growth to reduce unemployment, which suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy and support job creation. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, one of its key objectives."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a commitment to monitoring developments that could impact the Committee's objectives, without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It suggests diligence in observing factors that might influence the achievement of maximum employment and price stability, but does not signal an imminent policy tightening or easing."
1,"The economy continued to perform well into 2007, with solid growth through the third quarter and unemployment remaining near recent lows.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical state of the economy, noting solid growth and low unemployment, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply provides an assessment of past economic conditions, which does not inherently suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is performing well, with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. This could suggest that the economy is nearing or at full employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, especially if they perceive a risk of inflation rising above their long-term target of 2%."
1,"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policy should ""tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential,"" which suggests a readiness to adjust monetary policy proactively to stabilize output. The mention of tightening policy implies a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aimed at controlling inflation and maintaining stable prices, in line with the FOMC's goals."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations as a part of successful monetary policy but does not indicate a current or future direction of policy tightening or easing. It emphasizes the role of anchored inflation expectations in maintaining economic stability, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals but does not provide specific information on the current stance or adjustments to the monetary policy."
0,Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there is limited room for using monetary policy to further combat unemployment without potentially causing other issues, such as inflation. This suggests a stance against further easing of monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish view that prioritizes preventing inflation over additional stimulus for employment."
0,"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where longer-maturity obligations are more attractive due to stable inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations, and reduced economic volatility. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather describes favorable conditions that are consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. It suggests that the current policy stance is effective in maintaining stability, without implying an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that a decrease in job vacancies might occur without a significant drop in employment, which is referred to as a ""soft landing."" This indicates a scenario where the economy is cooling down enough to prevent overheating (which could lead to inflation) but not so much that it causes a significant increase in unemployment. The term ""soft landing"" implies a carefully balanced approach to managing the economy, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without clearly indicating an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
1,"In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where stable inflation expectations are contributing to low inflation, which in turn allows the central bank to maintain flexibility in responding to economic disturbances. This reflects a balanced view of the central bank's ability to achieve its goals without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the central bank has the ability to react to changes in the economy while maintaining its inflation target, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a comparison of the FOMC's results with those of central banks that use a flexible inflation targeting framework. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather comments on the effectiveness of the FOMC's approach in practice. The statement is more about the methodology and its outcomes, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"The unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the April and June meetings,","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the unemployment rate remaining unchanged over a specific period and does not directly indicate a policy action or a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance. It reflects one of the FOMC's goals—maximum employment—but without additional context on whether this rate is considered high, low, or at an equilibrium level, it does not suggest a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC anticipates a slowdown in economic growth, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy. This suggests a potential easing of policy to counteract the expected reduction in growth, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes stimulating economic activity and employment over combating inflation."
2,"In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to keep the target interest rate range at its current level until there is confidence that the economy has overcome recent challenges and is on course to meet the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. This indicates a stance of monetary easing or at least a commitment to maintain an accommodative policy until the stated economic conditions are met, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general effects of surprise monetary policy actions on stock prices without indicating a current or future direction of policy. It explains that a surprise tightening of policy would raise the risk premium and lower stock prices, while a surprise easing would lower the risk premium and raise stock prices. This is a statement of fact about how monetary policy can influence financial markets and does not reveal the Committee's current policy stance or intentions."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a data-dependent approach, suggesting that they are neither predisposed to tighten nor ease monetary policy without further economic evidence. This stance reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather waiting for additional information to determine the appropriate course of action. The focus on both inflation and economic growth aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment, and the use of incoming information to guide policy adjustments is consistent with a neutral and measured approach."
1,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about oil prices rising without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy in response to this change in oil prices. The sentence also does not provide information on how this price change is affecting the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it is considered neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,Table 2 Distribution of Employment and of Displaced Workers by Industry Category Industry Employment Displaced Workers Restructuring 23.1 42.2 Nonrestructuring 76.9 57.8 Total 100 100 Source: Displaced Worker Supplement to the CPS.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is a factual statement presenting data from the Displaced Worker Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It merely shows the distribution of employment and displaced workers by industry category, without suggesting any particular action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of the inflation averaging strategy without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states that the policy does not specify the acceptable bounds or duration for inflation above the 2% target, which is a neutral statement regarding the stance of monetary policy. It neither suggests imminent action to adjust interest rates nor indicates satisfaction with the current level of inflation, thus it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Our tools work on demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Our tools work on demand"" is a general statement about the effectiveness of the FOMC's monetary policy tools in influencing economic demand. It does not explicitly indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather affirms the capability of their instruments to affect the economy. This statement could be seen as a foundational belief in the efficacy of their policy measures, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In terms of the, you know, inflation, a couple things—your second question.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided does not offer any clear indication of a policy direction regarding tightening or easing of monetary policy. It appears to be an introductory remark to a broader discussion on inflation, without any specific details on policy actions or stances. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the FOMC is leaning towards a hawkish or dovish stance. It merely acknowledges the topic of inflation, which is one of the key concerns for the FOMC, but does not reveal any particular approach or reaction to current inflation trends."
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the nature of recessions following asset-price booms and busts, which is more of an analytical or research-oriented question rather than a direct statement on current monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather suggests a consideration of economic phenomena that could inform future policy decisions."
2,"As always, each participant’s projections are conditioned on his or her own view of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific direction on the stance of monetary policy but rather describes the process by which FOMC participants make their economic projections. It indicates that each participant's projections are based on their individual views of what constitutes appropriate monetary policy, which could encompass a range of stances from dovish to hawkish depending on the participant. This statement is procedural and does not signal a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, suggesting a balanced approach to monetary policy. The use of ""slightly higher"" or ""somewhat lower"" implies small adjustments rather than significant shifts, reflecting a stance that is neither clearly tightening nor easing but rather responsive to incoming economic data. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maintaining stable prices and sustainable economic growth, indicating a readiness to adapt policy as necessary to achieve its long-term objectives without signaling a strong commitment to either a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"Conversely, perhaps the transitory factors boosting productivity will recede more sharply than most observers anticipate, and the output gap will close more rapidly.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is a possibility that productivity-boosting factors might diminish faster than expected, leading to a quicker closure of the output gap. This scenario implies that the economy could heat up quickly, potentially increasing inflationary pressures. In response to such developments, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
2,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is speculative and does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It poses a question about the potential impact of a certain action on the conduct of monetary policy, without providing information on what that action might be or suggesting a preference for more or less accommodative policy measures. It reflects a neutral stance, focusing on the consideration of policy effectiveness rather than signaling a change in policy direction."
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there is an expectation of reduced stimulus (which could be seen as HAWKISH), this is expected to be offset by other factors such as low long-term interest rates and diminishing energy-related issues (which could be seen as DOVISH). The balance of these factors implies a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be neither signaling a clear move towards tightening nor easing but rather expecting different economic forces to balance each other out."
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation has increased, partly due to higher oil and gasoline prices. This observation suggests that inflationary pressures are present, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically within the household sector, noting a slowdown in the increase of home mortgage debt and sluggish home-price appreciation. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of certain economic indicators. This information could be used to inform future policy decisions, but on its own, it does not suggest a clear direction towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In light of increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, we now emphasize that the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy. The mention of ""increased uncertainties and muted inflation pressures"" suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging potential risks to economic growth and a lack of inflationary concerns, which typically would not warrant tightening measures. The commitment to ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion with a strong labor market and inflation near its 2 percent objective"" implies a readiness to implement policies that would support continued economic growth and employment, which may include lowering interest rates or other accommodative actions if deemed necessary. This aligns with a dovish approach, where the focus is on stimulating the economy rather than preventing overheating."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like"" does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy. It is a reflective statement that does not provide information on whether the speaker believes monetary policy should be tightened or eased. It does not discuss current economic conditions, policy adjustments, or the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it does not suggest a hawkish or dovish stance but rather a neutral, anecdotal remark."
2,inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will increase moderately due to a rebound in energy prices, but it does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to tighten or ease policy. The statement is simply forecasting a factor that could influence inflation, without indicating a direct policy response."
1,"Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to taking action to prevent the buildup of price pressures, which would typically involve tightening monetary policy to keep inflation low and stable. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the central bank is focused on preventing inflation from rising above its target level, even if it means acting against economic shocks that could potentially loosen monetary conditions."
1,"First, we must be mindful that an unexpected slowdown might occur in the growth of productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates caution regarding potential changes in productivity growth but does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of economic conditions that could impact the FOMC's goals but does not in itself advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
0,"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the trade deficit has narrowed due to a significant increase in exports relative to imports. This information is primarily related to trade balance and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of policy, as it does not specifically address inflation pressures, employment levels, or interest rate concerns that are central to the FOMC's mandate."
1,All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that all members of the FOMC are concerned about the risks of not achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation. This concern suggests that the Committee is focused on combating higher inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. A focus on reducing inflation typically involves measures such as raising interest rates, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate and keep the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged. This suggests a continuation of the existing monetary policy stance rather than a shift towards tightening or easing. The decision to keep rates steady reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a clear move to counteract inflation or stimulate the economy further."
1,"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates expectations of rising inflation, which is often a signal for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check. The mention of ""the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks"" and specific factors like rising oil prices, stabilizing commodity prices, and increasing health care costs suggest that inflationary pressures are building. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to actions aimed at preventing inflation from exceeding the target rate, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Employment continued to expand unevenly,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Employment continued to expand unevenly"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that while employment is growing, it is not doing so consistently across different sectors or regions. This statement reflects an observation of the current state of employment without providing a clear signal that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It is a neutral observation that acknowledges ongoing economic activity without suggesting imminent policy action."
0,It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in setting specific targets for unemployment and the uncertainty regarding the measures needed to achieve such goals. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the difficulties in policy planning given economic uncertainties."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the focus on these core objectives when setting interest rates, but does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical periods to draw lessons for current monetary policy management, without indicating a specific direction for policy tightening or easing. It suggests a consideration of past experiences to inform present decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to addressing risks and uncertainties. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the lessons learned advocate for a hawkish or dovish stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-standing mandate, but does not indicate a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions is a standard operational procedure and does not, in itself, signal a change in policy."
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a preference for gradually tightening monetary policy by removing accommodation, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The reference to a tight labor market with various indicators, such as low unemployment and difficulty in hiring, suggests that the economy is operating near or at full employment, which could lead to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the stance is to cautiously proceed with policy tightening, aligning with a hawkish view that prioritizes controlling inflation and maintaining stable prices, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
0,"They also generally expected that inflation would remain, for some time, below levels the Committee considers most consistent, over the longer run, with maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members expect inflation to remain below the levels they associate with their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability for some time. This suggests that there is less immediate concern about inflation running too high, which could mean that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy. Instead, it implies that there may be room for maintaining or even easing monetary policy to support employment without risking their price stability mandate, as inflation is not perceived as a current threat."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are current imbalances in demand and supply, including labor supply, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without causing persistent upward pressure on inflation. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, where the FOMC is not signaling an immediate need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather expects the market to self-correct. The statement reflects a balance between acknowledging present economic issues and an anticipation of natural adjustment without the need for intervention, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October"" is a factual statement about employment trends without a clear indication of a policy shift. It suggests that employment is growing, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, without additional context on how this growth interacts with inflation and the broader economic outlook, it does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reports on one aspect of the economic indicators the FOMC monitors."
2,"The slowing economy, together with rising interest rates, was in turn a major factor in precipitating the stock market crash.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic observation, noting the relationship between a slowing economy, rising interest rates, and a stock market crash. It does not directly indicate a future policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the consequences of past policy actions and economic conditions."
2,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC takes into consideration risks to the financial system that could impede achieving its goals, but it does not specify any particular direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring risks and adjusting policy as necessary to maintain its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is continuing to rise to levels not seen in 40 years, which is well above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation and bring it back down to their target level, reflecting a hawkish stance."
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where industrial production is increasing due to higher final demand and a reduction in the excess inventory, which indicates an alignment with economic growth and potentially a balanced approach to monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest a need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather reports on economic conditions that are consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The increase in industrial production could be seen as a positive sign for employment and economic health, but without further context on inflationary pressures or other economic indicators, the stance remains neutral."
1,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that a measure of inflation, specifically the trimmed mean measures, did not decrease as expected. This could suggest that inflationary pressures are more persistent than anticipated, which might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core consumer price inflation are low and that near-term inflation expectations have decreased, which suggests that there is less pressure on prices. Additionally, the mention of a weakened economic outlook implies that the economy might be underperforming, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment. This dovish stance would be in line with easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy and counteract low inflation and a weaker economic outlook."
2,Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that the indicators regarding the manufacturing sector's economic activity were mixed, which suggests that the FOMC does not have a clear signal from this sector to either increase or decrease the interest rate. This reflects a balanced view that would not necessarily prompt a change in monetary policy."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balance between concerns over potentially lower long-term inflation expectations and the risks of higher persistent inflation, especially in an economy operating above its potential. This suggests that the FOMC is weighing both the risks of inflation falling below their target and the risks of it exceeding the target, without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees no immediate need to tighten monetary policy because inflation is low and there is slack in resource utilization. This suggests a stance towards easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation, as there is no pressure to combat high inflation or overheating in the economy, which aligns with a dovish policy stance."
2,Same thing with economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Same thing with economic activity"" is too vague and lacks context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It does not provide any specific information about the direction of economic activity or the FOMC's response to it. Therefore, it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish without additional information. It simply acknowledges economic activity as a factor in consideration, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy."
1,"However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated, with the 12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has risen more than expected, with the PCE price index (a measure of inflation) reaching a 12-month change of 3%. This is above the FOMC's long-term target of 2% inflation, suggesting that the Committee may consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back towards its target, which is a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to reduce the money supply and cool down inflationary pressures."
2,"It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the impact of energy prices on core inflation has been minimal since the early 1980s, implying that even if energy prices rise, core inflation might remain low. Additionally, it suggests that overall inflation is likely to decrease if inflation expectations are kept in check. This points to a scenario where there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy because inflation is not a current concern, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current policy to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate threat of inflation."
0,The second requirement contributes to the first and also to smoothing fluctuations in output around full employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes how one policy requirement supports another in achieving full employment and stabilizing output, without explicitly indicating a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to managing economic activity, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"And in so far as that will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider a wide range of factors, including fiscal policies, the global environment, and oil prices, when determining monetary policy. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, without a clear indication of leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC is expressing a readiness to adjust policy in response to various economic indicators and conditions, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests satisfaction with the current framework for achieving these goals, implying a balanced approach rather than a shift towards either more aggressive or more accommodative measures."
0,"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general observation about the complexity of productivity growth factors, which is a component of economic analysis but does not suggest a specific policy action."
1,Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants expect inflation to increase as resources become more utilized and wage pressures grow. This expectation of rising inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
0,"First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a revision of economic projections, specifically regarding productivity gains and potential output growth, but does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions, which is a necessary input for policy decisions, but the stance on policy itself remains unclear from this sentence alone. The FOMC may adjust policy in response to such changes in projections, but the direction of the adjustment (hawkish or dovish) cannot be inferred from this statement without additional context."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real interest rate in the context of productivity trends. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it describes a scenario where fiscal policy (government spending and surplus) interacts with economic variables (productivity and interest rates), which could have implications for monetary policy but does not in itself suggest an immediate action by the FOMC."
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the recent spike in inflation is temporary and not widespread across the economy. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as it is expected to subside on its own. The use of the term ""transitory"" indicates that the Committee does not view the inflationary pressures as persistent enough to warrant a hawkish response, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current policy to support maximum employment and stable prices over the long term."
2,"In the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), dealers indicated, on net, that they loosened credit terms applicable to several important classes of counterparties and types of collateral over the past three months amid increased demand for funding for most types of securities covered in the survey.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where credit terms have been loosened, which could be seen as a dovish action, but it also mentions increased demand for funding, which could suggest economic growth and potentially inflationary pressures. The statement does not directly indicate a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy but rather reports on observed market conditions. It does not explicitly state an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy by the FOMC, thus it is best classified as neutral."
2,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's effort to find a theoretical point of balance in the economy, which does not directly indicate a current or future action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a conceptual approach to understanding inflation dynamics rather than a clear policy stance."
2,"Some participants stated that low interest rates appeared to be contributing to strong sales of autos or, more generally, of consumer durables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the current economic conditions, specifically the relationship between low interest rates and strong sales of consumer durables, without directly suggesting a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It acknowledges the effect of low interest rates on consumer behavior, which is relevant to the FOMC's goals, but does not indicate a clear stance on changing the monetary policy in response to these conditions."
1,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that strong productivity growth allows for higher real interest rates without hampering economic growth. Higher real interest rates are typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy, as they can help control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. The statement suggests that the economy can withstand higher interest rates due to productivity gains, which is a hawkish stance as it indicates a potential for policy tightening to manage inflation and ensure stable prices, in line with the FOMC's goals."
2,"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes projections for unemployment and inflation that align with the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) median projections, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests an expectation of improvement in labor force participation and employment, as well as a projection for inflation that is consistent with the Committee's goals. The statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent policy actions to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation, thus it is best classified as neutral."
0,"Even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for August showed weak job gains.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the employment report for August, even after accounting for the effects of strikes, showed weak job gains. This suggests that the labor market is not overheating and may be underperforming, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate employment, in line with its commitment to maximum employment. There is no indication of concern over inflationary pressures that would warrant a tightening of policy, hence the dovish classification."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a wait-and-see approach, emphasizing the importance of incoming economic data before deciding on any changes to the monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy without further evidence, reflecting a neutral position."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests concern about a potential increase in core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by influencing inflation expectations to rise. This indicates a risk of inflation exceeding the target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to bring inflation back to the desired level."
0,"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of labor market conditions, particularly focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor force participation of prime-age women and the distribution of job losses across industries. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges in achieving maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The mention of potential scarring effects and implications for growth is a concern for the long-term outlook, but the sentence does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,Members also agreed that there was only a remote possibility that the process of disinflation would cumulate to the point of a decline for an extended period in the general price level.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members believe there is only a small chance of a prolonged period of deflation, which suggests that they are not considering an easing of monetary policy to counteract deflationary pressures. This implies a stance that is not geared towards stimulating the economy, which is typically associated with a hawkish outlook, as it suggests confidence in the current or projected strength of the economy and a focus on preventing inflation rather than combating deflation."
0,Members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concerns about the potential long-term economic impact of large deficits but does not directly indicate an immediate stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects awareness of fiscal issues that could affect the economy but does not suggest a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Household expenditures on new homes were likewise at an elevated level, although members reported weakness in some price segments and geographic areas of the housing market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of household expenditures on new homes, noting both strength in general and weakness in specific segments and areas. This observation does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a balanced view of the housing market, which is one component of the broader economy that the FOMC monitors. The statement acknowledges the mixed signals in the housing market without suggesting an immediate need for policy adjustment to address inflation or employment goals."
0,"However, some areas that were affected by the slowdown in the energy sector experienced house price declines or increases in mortgage delinquency rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific economic condition related to the energy sector that has led to house price declines and higher mortgage delinquency rates in certain areas. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of regional economic impacts. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction of policy adjustment."
2,"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a social and labor market issue related to the changing skill demands and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges a factor that could potentially affect employment but does not suggest any specific monetary policy action in response."
2,They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concern about the difficulty in achieving the 2 percent inflation target, suggesting that inflation is currently below the desired level. This could indicate a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling further and to steer it back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance."
0,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation regarding the relationship between low inflation, deflation, and their potential economic costs without indicating a specific policy action or direction. It acknowledges the challenges posed by both very low inflation and deflation but does not suggest an immediate policy response, thus maintaining a neutral stance on monetary policy."
0,"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the housing market's response to lower mortgage rates, indicating some increase in refinancing and purchase activity. However, it also expresses uncertainty about the long-term impact on housing demand. This statement does not clearly suggest a move toward tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions related to housing market activity. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators to inform their policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for future policy adjustments."
0,"Major reasons for optimism about the outlook were the substantial easing in monetary policy, whose lagged effects would be felt increasingly in the year ahead, and the fiscal stimulus measures that already had been enacted and might well be supplemented over coming months.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a positive view on the economy due to recent easing in monetary policy and fiscal stimulus measures. The mention of ""substantial easing in monetary policy"" suggests that the FOMC has recently implemented policies to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth. The expectation that the effects of these policies will be felt increasingly suggests that the FOMC anticipates that these measures will continue to support the economy in the future, without the need for immediate further tightening."
2,"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to data-driven and transparent policy-making. The projections themselves could lead to either a hawkish or dovish stance, but the sentence does not provide information on the content or implications of these projections."
1,The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports a fact about the unemployment rate decreasing to 5%, without providing any explicit indication of the FOMC's future policy direction. It does not suggest whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide information on how this change in the unemployment rate aligns with the FOMC's broader economic outlook or policy objectives. The decrease in the unemployment rate could be seen as a sign of economic strength, but without additional context on inflation or other economic indicators, the policy stance cannot be determined from this sentence alone."
1,The effect can be accentuated by the temporary parking in liquid accounts of the proceeds from the more-frequent turnover and refinancings that often accompany a house price boom.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a phenomenon related to the behavior of money during a house price boom but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply observes that funds from housing transactions may be temporarily held in liquid accounts, which is a neutral observation and does not inherently suggest a policy action to either raise or lower interest rates."
0,"In agriculture, depressed levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued to weaken farm income.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, with low crop prices and weak global demand leading to reduced farm income. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds that could lead to lower inflationary pressures and potentially a shortfall in employment in this sector. A dovish stance would be more likely in this context, as the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support economic activity and counteract these negative effects."
0,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition regarding credit availability and housing prices, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that those with access to credit can take advantage of lower house prices, which could be a reflection of economic conditions rather than a statement of policy intent. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides an observation of the market situation."
2,"The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is focused on monitoring inflation and inflation expectations, suggesting a readiness to adjust policy if inflation does not prove to be transitory. This vigilance against inflation is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 1998.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the projections for CPI inflation rates are slightly above the FOMC's target of 2% inflation over the long term. Inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent for 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent for 1998 suggest an upward trend in inflation. If inflation is projected to rise above the target, the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding the current account deficit and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It explains the deficit's growth due to increased investment and productivity in the U.S., attracting capital inflows because of higher rates of return. This statement is more about the economic conditions and the reasons behind capital movements rather than a clear signal of the FOMC's intent to tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, members agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the existing highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have agreed to maintain a highly accommodative stance, which typically means keeping interest rates low to stimulate the economy. This approach is consistent with a dovish monetary policy, which is aimed at easing financial conditions, supporting employment, and lifting inflation towards the Committee's target."
1,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a neutral observation about productivity growth, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply provides an assessment of economic conditions, specifically productivity trends, which is one of the many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the monetary policy in response to productivity growth rates."
0,"still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy is expected to remain ""highly accommodative,"" which typically means that the policy stance is geared towards stimulating economic activity, often through lower interest rates or other measures to increase the money supply. The reference to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing employment, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports growth and employment over immediate concerns about inflation."
2,"Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there are positive signs in the economy, such as increasing expenditures on high-tech equipment and software, and potential favorable effects on business capital spending due to a positive outcome in the war against Iraq and a possible rally in the stock market. This observation does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC might use such information to balance risks and adjust policy as needed to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy direction."
2,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in the growth of the money supply (M2 and M3), which is often associated with a tightening of monetary policy. By moderating the growth of these aggregates, the FOMC may be aiming to control inflationary pressures, aligning with their goal of stable prices. This action typically reflects a hawkish stance, as it suggests measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) commitment to maintaining inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent target, which is consistent with their stated long-term goal for price stability. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of managing inflation expectations. The focus on anchoring inflation expectations suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, aiming to prevent both deflation and runaway inflation, which aligns with a neutral stance."
0,"In the household sector, the ongoing deceleration in house prices further restrained the growth of home mortgage debt.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation in the housing sector, noting that a slowdown in house price growth is leading to a restraint in the growth of home mortgage debt. This statement is a factual assessment of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy but rather provides context on a particular economic indicator that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. The impact on monetary policy stance is not clear from this sentence alone, as it could be part of a broader analysis that includes both positive and negative economic developments."
2,"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC decided to maintain the same growth ranges for the monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach reflects a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making adjustments based on new economic data or changes in the economic outlook."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad objectives that guide the Committee's decisions."
1,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to restoring price stability, which suggests that the FOMC may be willing to tighten monetary policy to control inflation and achieve its target rate. This stance is typically associated with actions such as raising interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on maintaining an accommodative policy stance, which means keeping monetary policy easy to support economic activity. This is aimed at ensuring that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating the economy and employment over tightening to combat potential inflation. The mention of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate suggests a context where there is limited room for further rate cuts, thus emphasizing the need to keep policy accommodative to support the FOMC's goals."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. This sentence does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a change in market perception. It does not provide information on the actual stance of the FOMC or its future policy moves, thus it is considered neutral."
0,"In their discussion of considerations related to asset purchases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve's response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recovery.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that various FOMC participants view asset purchases as a critical tool for responding to the economic effects of the pandemic. The purpose of these purchases, as mentioned, is to support smooth financial market functioning and maintain accommodative financial conditions, which in turn helps the flow of credit to households and businesses, supporting economic recovery. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach. The focus on using asset purchases to aid recovery implies that the FOMC is willing to inject more liquidity into the economy, which is a typical dovish measure to counteract economic slowdowns and is not indicative of tightening monetary policy."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising energy and commodity prices leading to higher inflation and lower growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, even at the risk of further slowing growth, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes inflation control over stimulating the economy."
2,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that commodity prices have been rising sharply, which could signal increasing inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, rising inflation may prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to stabilize prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is taking steps to reduce its balance sheet at a faster rate than in the previous cycle, in conjunction with raising the policy rate. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as it is aimed at reducing liquidity in the financial system to help balance demand with supply, which is typically done to combat inflation or prevent an overheating economy. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests a hawkish stance."
0,"Just as in the earlier analysis of Ammer and Freeman, this analysis suggested that in all three countries the inflation targeting led to a drop in inflation and nominal interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of inflation targeting in three countries, noting a reduction in both inflation and nominal interest rates. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a change in stance by the FOMC but rather reflects on the outcomes of a particular monetary policy strategy. The sentence is analytical and does not advocate for a tightening or easing of policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance, which typically involves lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity, until the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and inflation moderately exceeding 2% for some time are met. This suggests a focus on supporting economic growth and employment rather than on tightening policy to combat inflation, which is characteristic of a dovish stance."
0,too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a viewpoint on the state of employment but does not directly relate to actions the FOMC might take. It could be interpreted as a critique of forecasts or expectations rather than a policy stance. Without additional context indicating a policy shift, the sentence is best classified as neutral."
1,"Consumer sentiment was at or close to historically high levels according to recent surveys, evidently reflecting the strong uptrend in employment and income and to some extent the very large cumulative increase in stock market wealth over the course of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic condition, with high consumer sentiment linked to strong employment, income trends, and stock market gains. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic situation. The FOMC might view this as evidence that their current policy stance is effective in promoting their goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without suggesting any immediate need for policy adjustment."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to correct market prices if they are based on misconceptions about the economy or the Federal Reserve's intentions. This suggests that the FOMC is prepared to take action, potentially by tightening monetary policy, to ensure that market expectations align with their views and objectives, which include stable prices. The use of ""provide an anchor"" implies a commitment to preventing inflation from deviating from their target, which is often associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members are considering an easing of monetary policy to support financial markets and mitigate risks to economic growth. Easing policy typically involves lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors more accommodative monetary policy to support employment and growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, which implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to control inflationary pressures. The focus on avoiding a concerning rise in inflation expectations aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
1,This is an example of offsetting the attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a more aggressive response to inflation realizations, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to address rising inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a priority on controlling inflation, even if it means a stronger reaction to the current economic conditions. The FOMC would likely raise interest rates or take other measures to cool down inflationary pressures, consistent with their goal of maintaining stable prices."
1,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives a greater risk of increased inflation in the near future. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and prevent excessive inflation."
0,"I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current unemployment rate is below what the FOMC considers consistent with maximum employment, which could indicate that the labor market is tight. A tight labor market often leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which in turn could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Thus, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, as it implies the possibility of future policy actions to address the tightness in the labor market."
0,"In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current unemployment rate is below what the FOMC considers consistent with maximum employment, which could indicate that the labor market is tight. A tight labor market often leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which in turn could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Thus, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, as it implies the possibility of future policy actions to address the tightness in the labor market."
2,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a natural moderation in economic growth due to a projected slowdown in inventory investment. This does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a factor that could influence economic activity. It reflects an observation of economic conditions without a clear bias toward a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine process of the FOMC, where participants submit their economic projections based on their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (neither tightening nor easing) but rather reflects the Committee's ongoing analysis and data-gathering efforts to inform future policy decisions. The mention of projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation, in conjunction with appropriate monetary policy, suggests a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a negative impact on real income growth due to higher energy prices, this was counterbalanced by strong increases in wages and salaries. This suggests a mixed economic situation where there are both inflationary pressures (from energy prices) and signs of a healthy labor market (from wage growth). The sentence does not clearly lean towards a need for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a balanced view of economic conditions."
0,"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite significant monetary easing and fiscal stimulus measures, there are expectations of slow growth in consumer spending and housing demand due to sluggish hiring and a decline in household wealth. This suggests that the economy might need further support, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors monetary policy easing to stimulate economic activity."
1,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the American economy is robust enough to withstand the effects of a tightening monetary policy, which typically includes raising interest rates to control inflation. This implies that the FOMC may be inclined to increase interest rates or reduce monetary accommodation to ensure price stability, one of its key goals, even if it could potentially slow down economic activity. The statement reflects a readiness to act against inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the behavior of equity prices during different phases of the economic cycle, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on market dynamics."
2,We also don’t conduct monetary policy in order to prove our independence.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a principle regarding the motivation behind policy decisions, emphasizing that the decisions are not made to demonstrate the Federal Reserve's independence, but rather to achieve its mandated goals. It does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments."
2,"He also judged that the policy step would do little to improve near-term growth prospects, given the ongoing structural adjustments and external challenges faced by the U. S. economy.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes a policy action (presumably tightening) would not significantly enhance near-term economic growth due to structural and external challenges. This implies a stance against tightening, as it would not address the current economic issues effectively, aligning with a dovish approach that favors maintaining or easing monetary policy to support growth."
2,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the inherent volatility in inflation measures without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing but rather an acceptance of the fluctuating nature of inflation data. This stance is consistent with a balanced view that would require further context to determine a specific policy direction."
1,"However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that if progress on employment and inflation is faster than expected, the FOMC is likely to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sooner than anticipated. Raising interest rates is a tool used to tighten monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. This action would be in response to signs of a potentially overheating economy, where employment and inflation exceed the Committee's objectives, warranting measures to prevent excessive inflation and maintain economic stability."
2,Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of experienced loan officers in effectively distributing loans to stimulate wealth and growth in the local economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it focuses on the qualitative aspect of loan distribution and its potential impact on economic growth, which is more related to banking practices and financial intermediation rather than the FOMC's monetary policy actions."
2,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the technical aspects of measuring economic productivity and standards of living, rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy. It discusses the importance of clear definitions and consistent units in economic measurement, which is a foundational concept for economic analysis but does not signal any immediate action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides information about the staff composition of the Washington employees, specifically the number of Ph.D. economists who support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's views on current economic conditions or future policy actions. It is simply a factual statement about the personnel involved in supporting monetary policy decisions."
0,"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy due to the absence of increasing inflation pressures. This suggests a stance towards easing, or at least not tightening, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The implication is that since inflation is not accelerating, there is less urgency to increase interest rates to slow down demand, which would be consistent with a policy aimed at supporting employment and economic growth."
1,These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its longer-run potential.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could rise more than expected if the economy grows beyond its longer-run potential. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggested that most firms had little ability to raise their prices in the current economic environment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that firms are not in a position to increase prices, which suggests that inflationary pressures are subdued. This could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
0,"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in the Federal Reserve's approach to employment, focusing on ""shortfalls"" rather than ""deviations"" from maximum employment. This suggests a tolerance for lower levels of unemployment without preemptively tightening monetary policy, as the emphasis is on avoiding situations where employment is below its maximum level rather than being concerned with employment being too high. This dovish stance implies a willingness to keep monetary policy more accommodative to support employment, consistent with a less aggressive approach to inflation unless it is persistently above the target."
2,"Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the tools used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy, including outright purchases and sales of assets, repurchase agreements, and discount window loans. It also speculates that these tools could be used in a hypothetical situation where Treasury securities are not available. This statement is simply an observation of the methods available to the Fed and does not indicate a specific direction of policy (tightening or easing). It reflects a neutral stance as it does not suggest any imminent changes to the current monetary policy or its intensity."
1,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if there is an unexpected sharp increase in wages or inflation, it could be a sign that the economy is reaching a point where it might overheat, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation and maintain stability. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors measures to control inflation, often through higher interest rates or other forms of monetary policy tightening."
2,"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in measuring quality changes in the context of personal computers and how these changes may not be adequately reflected in published price indexes. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic data measurement rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
1,"M3 growth slowed less than that of M2 in November, in part because of stepped-up issuance of large time deposits as banks reduced their reliance on funding from overseas offices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific observation regarding the growth rates of different money supply measures (M3 and M2) and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It explains a shift in banking practices related to funding sources without suggesting an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on the composition of money supply growth and its sources is more of a descriptive statement about financial conditions rather than a prescriptive statement about future policy actions."
2,"In discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggesting that long-term unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment does.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are skeptical about the idea that long-term unemployment exerts less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment. This skepticism could lead them to believe that the labor market is tighter than some studies suggest, which might result in higher inflationary pressures. Therefore, they might be more inclined to support a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in using different measures of inflation for policy decisions, highlighting a technical consideration rather than indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy but rather points to the complexity of interpreting inflation indicators in the context of monetary policy."
2,It was the year of synchronized global growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It was the year of synchronized global growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a descriptive statement about the state of the global economy, without any explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. It does not provide information on inflation, employment, or interest rates, which are the key indicators for determining the FOMC's policy stance."
2,"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the complexity of inflation dynamics and suggests that there are multiple factors influencing inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not commit to either tightening or easing policy, but rather implies a need for careful consideration of various influences on inflation. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to continue with the current pace of asset purchases until there is substantial progress toward the goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a policy of monetary easing aimed at stimulating the economy, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The use of asset purchases is typically a tool to lower interest rates and increase money supply, supporting economic activity when the Committee believes that more stimulus is needed to reach its employment and inflation objectives."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is prepared to continue or expand its asset purchase programs and use other policy tools to support the labor market if there is not a substantial improvement. This suggests a willingness to provide additional monetary stimulus to the economy, which is consistent with a dovish stance that aims to ease monetary policy in order to support employment and economic growth, as long as price stability is not jeopardized. The focus on continued asset purchases and potential additional measures to stimulate the economy reflects a commitment to an accommodative policy until the labor market improves, which aligns with the dovish approach of prioritizing employment objectives under stable price conditions."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a trade-off for achieving price stability. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, even at the cost of potentially negative impacts on employment and growth, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,We want to see lower unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""We want to see lower unemployment"" suggests that the FOMC is focused on reducing unemployment, which aligns with a dovish stance that typically involves easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and job creation. This could imply a willingness to keep interest rates lower to support growth and employment, which is one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand."" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It merely states a reason for an economic condition without suggesting whether the Federal Reserve should tighten or ease monetary policy. The sentence could be part of a broader discussion on economic conditions that could lead to either a hawkish or dovish stance, but on its own, it remains neutral."
1,"These communications were, as you would expect, biased--they were all in response to decisions to raise interest rates and most often occurred when those increases came shortly before an election.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical pattern of communication in response to interest rate increases, particularly around election times, but does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy action. It is more of a commentary on the timing and context of past communications rather than a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical data regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and its growth rate over a specific period. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a factual account of past ECI performance, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy direction."
2,"Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?"" does not provide a clear indication of the direction of monetary policy. It seems to be the beginning of a discussion or analysis rather than a statement of policy stance. Productivity growth and cost reductions can have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context, it's not possible to determine whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to a presentation made by two economists regarding stock market valuation, using dividend-price ratios and related measures. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates that would influence the FOMC's monetary policy decisions. It is simply a recount of an event and does not reflect a policy stance."
1,"PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the current increase in headline inflation is viewed as temporary and primarily driven by oil prices. The expectation is for inflation to return to the target level of 2 percent, which implies that there may not be a pressing need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus is on supporting economic growth and employment rather than on combating higher inflation."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities. This action is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. By providing support to private credit markets and economic activity, the FOMC is taking a dovish stance, which is associated with easing monetary policy to promote economic growth, especially when facing risks of economic downturns or below-target inflation. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, particularly when the economy is not at risk of overheating."
1,Some price increases had been noted,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Some price increases had been noted"" suggests that there is an observation of rising prices, which could be indicative of inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other contractionary measures to ensure price stability, one of its key mandates."
2,"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various factors that are supporting consumer spending, which is a component of economic activity, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and retail discounting are external economic factors that can influence consumer behavior, but the sentence does not suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states observations that could be part of the broader economic context the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
2,"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt over a specified period, which indicates a steady approach rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. This suggests a balanced stance, aiming to support their long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a shift in policy direction."
0,"Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members view the risks of inflation increasing as less pressing than the risks of inflation decreasing in the near term. This suggests that they are more concerned about potential deflation or low inflation than about high inflation, which could imply a stance that is more open to easing monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling too far below their target. This dovish stance would support economic activity by potentially keeping interest rates lower to stimulate borrowing and spending."
1,"Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a balanced view of the economic factors affecting household spending. On one hand, it acknowledges positive factors such as higher employment and lower energy prices that support spending, which could be seen as reducing the need for an accommodative policy. On the other hand, it mentions negative factors like lessened stimulus from wealth gains and the need for households to rebuild savings, which could suggest a need for continued support. Overall, the sentence does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a mixed economic outlook."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that with the economy nearing full employment, there is an increased likelihood of stronger inflation outcomes due to potential fiscal stimulus. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to tighten monetary policy in response to these inflationary pressures, consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will adjust its asset purchase program based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced approach, where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further data. Instead, they are maintaining flexibility to respond to economic conditions as they evolve."
2,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is unable to provide additional monetary easing through its typical method of cutting short-term interest rates. This suggests that the current policy stance is not towards easing (which would be dovish), and the inability to cut rates further could be interpreted as a signal that the policy may be more restrictive or that there is less room for accommodative measures, which is generally considered a hawkish stance."
2,But there’s also a role for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But there’s also a role for monetary policy."" is neutral as it does not provide any specific direction on whether the monetary policy should be tightened or eased. It simply acknowledges that monetary policy has a part to play in achieving the Federal Reserve's goals without indicating a preference for a more hawkish or dovish approach."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the types of assets that investors are holding, with an increased preference for retail money market mutual funds, which are generally considered safe and liquid. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather reflects investor behavior in response to economic conditions. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides information on market trends that the FOMC might consider when evaluating the overall economic situation."
0,"Of course, we can’t do anything about long-run employment opportunities, but we can help the economy recover more quickly.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC is willing to take action to support the economy's recovery, which suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and improve employment conditions. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it indicates a focus on boosting economic activity rather than on tightening policy to combat inflation."
0,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern about inflation not reaching the target level in a consistent and balanced manner. This suggests that the FOMC may consider policies to stimulate the economy to drive inflation towards the target, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support growth and employment."
2,"In the Committee’s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the majority of the FOMC members agreed to maintain the current target federal funds rate, suggesting that they believe the existing rate is appropriate to achieve their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This decision reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing."
2,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is recognition of potential risks to inflation and economic growth, the consensus is that the most probable scenario is one of stable prices and sustainable growth. The Committee's decision to maintain a balanced assessment of risks, assuming appropriate policy actions are taken, suggests that they are neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but are instead aiming to respond to economic conditions as they evolve to maintain their objectives. This balanced approach aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
1,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. A widening trade deficit could have various implications for the economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond by tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an economic observation without a clear direction on policy adjustments."
1,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where, despite slow overall economic growth and disappointing productivity, the labor market is still generating a significant number of jobs each month. This indicates a mixed economic scenario where the labor market is performing relatively well in terms of job creation, which could be seen as a positive sign for employment, but is contrasted with slow growth and poor productivity, which could be a concern for long-term economic health. The statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides an observation of the current economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment but also hints at potential challenges that could affect stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The balance between the positive job creation numbers and the negative aspects of slow growth and productivity leads to a classification of NEUTRAL, as it does not clearly advocate for a policy shift in either direction."
0,It will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is underway of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is not yet on a strong and persistent growth path that would lead to full employment, suggesting that the FOMC may maintain or introduce policies to stimulate economic expansion. This dovish stance indicates a readiness to ease monetary policy to support growth and move towards the goal of maximum employment."
0,"however, apart from the energy and health care sectors, price inflation had remained relatively subdued, evidently reflecting the combination of diminished growth in overall demand and strong competitive pressures in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is relatively subdued in most markets, except for energy and health care, due to reduced growth in overall demand and strong competitive pressures. This suggests that there is less concern about widespread inflationary pressures that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or for potential easing to support demand without triggering high inflation."
0,"Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the sources of productivity growth in the United States, attributing it to an investment boom and a technological revolution. It does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific guidance on the FOMC's current assessment of economic conditions in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence is more of a neutral statement on economic factors contributing to productivity rather than a signal of monetary policy direction."
2,"First, insofar as recent productivity growth is concerned, I have a serious question about the quality of the data that we employ to measure output in today's economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the quality of productivity growth data, which is a technical observation rather than a direct indication of a future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on the accuracy of economic measurements, which is important for informed decision-making but does not in itself reveal a hawkish or dovish inclination."
1,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is a positive development in economic activity, with household spending increasing and business investment continuing to grow strongly. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, neither explicitly signaling a need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects economic growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, but does not directly address inflation pressures or the need for policy adjustment."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is usually associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or curbing high inflation."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a study's findings on the relationship between U.S. short-term interest rates and euro area bond yields, which is an observation of market dynamics rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a slowdown in output and employment, the FOMC expects that with continued policy accommodation (which typically means keeping interest rates low or providing other forms of monetary stimulus), economic activity will grow and labor market conditions will improve. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in order to support the economy and move closer to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term determinants of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet size, which is influenced by the public's demand for its liabilities, such as currency and reserves. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a factor that influences the central bank's operations. The focus on the public's demand for liabilities is a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation and does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"Today, just nine months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent--a larger decline than most FOMC participants expected in September.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant decline in the unemployment rate, which is a larger improvement than the FOMC participants had anticipated. This could suggest that the economy is heating up faster than expected, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. In response to such conditions, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the market, which would be consistent with a hawkish approach to ensure stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are labor shortages in several districts, which can lead to upward pressure on wages as businesses compete for qualified workers. This could contribute to inflationary pressures, suggesting a need for a tighter monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider such information as a signal to raise interest rates or take other actions to tighten monetary policy in order to achieve its goal of stable prices."
2,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural step in the FOMC's meeting process, focusing on discussing economic conditions and policy implementation without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's routine consideration of economic data and policy options, which is a standard part of their decision-making process."
2,"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the response to demand shocks in the context of well-anchored inflation expectations, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It outlines a scenario where policy can adjust real rates in response to economic conditions, which is a standard approach to maintaining stability. The focus is on the adaptability of policy in the face of demand shocks, rather than a commitment to move in a specific direction (tighter or looser monetary policy)."
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is no significant wage-induced inflation pressure, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy. This dovish stance indicates a potential for maintaining or easing the current monetary policy, as there is no evidence from wage trends that would necessitate a more aggressive approach to combat inflation."
2,It is precisely because none of these preconditions hold that monetary policy is so difficult and principles are needed to guide its implementation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the complexity of monetary policy implementation and the need for guiding principles, which suggests a balanced approach that could swing either way depending on the economic conditions and adherence to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Moreover, survey data on labor market attitudes of both consumers and businesses had not signaled a significant deterioration in employment prospects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is no significant change in employment prospects according to survey data, which suggests that the current state of the labor market is stable. This does not directly imply a need for a change in monetary policy, whether it be tightening or easing, as it reflects a situation where employment conditions are neither improving nor worsening significantly. Therefore, the stance is neutral with respect to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Indeed, just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 Moreover, with the development and distribution of several remarkably effective vaccines, the monetary and fiscal policies presently in place should continue to support the strong expansion in economic activity that is expected to be realized this year, although, obviously, the rapid spread of the Delta variant among the still considerable fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is clearly a downside risk for the outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of the current economic situation, acknowledging both positive developments (the end of the recession and the effectiveness of vaccines) and potential risks (the spread of the Delta variant). It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes the context in which the monetary and fiscal policies are expected to support economic expansion. The mention of both supportive policies and downside risks suggests a balanced view, aligning with a NEUTRAL stance."
2,Survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that long-term inflation expectations remain stable despite previous higher inflation readings, suggesting that there is no need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat persistent inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies that the FOMC may not see an immediate need to increase interest rates to curb inflationary pressures, given that the market does not expect long-term inflation to rise."
0,These participants concluded that the Committee should wait to take another step in removing accommodation until the data on economic activity provided a greater level of confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that certain FOMC participants are advocating for a pause in tightening monetary policy until there is more evidence that the economy is robust enough to handle potential negative demand shocks. This indicates a preference for maintaining or increasing monetary accommodation in the short term to support economic growth, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted in part by favorable earnings reports from the retail sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding stock price indexes rising due to favorable earnings reports from the retail sector. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance or suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to adjust its policy in response to these market conditions. The statement is simply reporting an economic development without implying a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes a method by which the FOMC might gauge inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an approach to understanding economic conditions, which is a necessary component of informed policy-making. Understanding inflation expectations is part of the FOMC's assessment process and helps in achieving its long-term inflation target, but the sentence itself does not convey a stance on the current policy direction."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective that does not explicitly signal a change in policy stance."
1,"However, the historical record suggests that permanently lowering inflation expectations may require keeping monetary policy tight for a substantial period, resulting in considerable output and employment losses for a time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that to lower inflation expectations, monetary policy may need to remain tight for an extended period, even if it leads to significant losses in output and employment temporarily. This stance reflects a willingness to prioritize the control of inflation over the short-term goal of maximum employment, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy typically involves raising interest rates to reduce inflation, which can slow economic growth and increase unemployment in the short term."
2,Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s"" is a historical statement that does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It simply reflects a period of stable prices in the past, without suggesting any particular action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy in the present context. It does not provide information on employment or interest rates, nor does it suggest any immediate policy adjustments by the FOMC."
2,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the use of a range of labor market indicators to assess the state of employment and sets an expectation for reaching maximum employment based on a projected unemployment rate. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses the conditions under which the FOMC's employment goal might be considered achieved. The focus is on the assessment and expectations of labor market conditions, without a clear direction on future monetary policy actions."
2,"However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in asset prices dominated by fundamental forces and those driven by non-fundamental forces, policymakers should not target asset prices or try to guide them to the policymakers' estimate of fundamental value.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges policymakers face in determining the drivers behind asset price changes and suggests that they should not target or guide asset prices based on their estimates of fundamental value. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather addresses the complexity of interpreting financial market signals and the appropriate role of monetary policy with respect to asset prices. It reflects a balanced view on how the FOMC should respond to movements in asset prices, without suggesting any specific monetary policy action."
0,"The Committee again anticipated that it likely would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remained well anchored.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee expects to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for an extended period after the end of the asset purchase program, particularly if inflation remains below the 2 percent target and long-term inflation expectations are stable. This suggests a stance towards easing or at least not tightening monetary policy, as the Committee is signaling a willingness to keep rates low to support economic activity and boost inflation towards its target level. The reference to maintaining low rates in the context of low inflation is consistent with a dovish approach, which is generally characterized by a focus on stimulating the economy and achieving higher employment, even at the risk of tolerating somewhat higher inflation."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections of output growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2011 through 2013 and over the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to data-driven decision-making. The projections themselves could lead to hawkish or dovish policy actions, but the sentence merely states that the projections were made, without providing insight into their implications for monetary policy."
2,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a belief in the compatibility of full employment and price stability over the long term, which is a fundamental principle of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather affirms the long-term goals of the FOMC. This statement is neutral as it does not lean towards a hawkish stance (tightening policy) or a dovish stance (easing policy), but instead reflects a balanced view that the two objectives can be achieved simultaneously in the long run."
1,"The distortions in the markets I have reviewed do not appear all that large, given the stance of monetary policy, and should we experience much higher interest rates and softer asset prices our resilient markets and flexible economy probably could absorb such a shock.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the current distortions in the markets are not significant in the context of the existing monetary policy stance and that the economy is resilient enough to absorb potential shocks from higher interest rates and softer asset prices. This indicates a belief in the economy's ability to handle changes without explicitly suggesting an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view that does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance but rather conveys confidence in the economy's flexibility and the current policy's appropriateness."
2,Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Trends in wages and prices have remained stable in recent months"" suggests that there is neither significant inflationary pressure that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish stance) nor deflationary pressure that would require an easing of policy (dovish stance). Stability in wages and prices aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, suggesting that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining the balance between inflation and employment objectives. Therefore, the statement can be considered neutral, indicating that no immediate change in policy stance is necessary."
2,"Indeed, the commitment to long-run price stability can afford the central bank some flexibility in employing its tools to address shorter-run economic issues.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the central bank's commitment to long-run price stability allows for flexibility in addressing short-term economic issues. This suggests a balanced approach, where the central bank may adjust its policy tools as needed to respond to current economic conditions without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on long-term price stability is a core objective, but the mention of flexibility implies that the FOMC is prepared to adapt to changing circumstances, which is a neutral stance."
2,One measure of the decline in recent years of the marginal cost of additions to oil availability is the downdrift in the prices of the most distant contracts for future delivery of Light Sweet crude oil.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation in the oil market, specifically a decline in the marginal cost of oil availability as evidenced by the prices of future contracts for Light Sweet crude oil. This statement is a factual remark about market conditions rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is more of a comment on an external economic factor that could influence inflation or economic activity, which the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. However, without additional context on how this observation would affect the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed situation where employment growth is decelerating, but the unemployment rate is not increasing, suggesting a potentially balanced but cautious economic outlook. This could be interpreted as the labor market not overheating (which might be hawkish) nor weakening significantly (which might be dovish), thus warranting a neutral stance."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond solely to monetary policy actions like adjusting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects a balanced view on the tools available for managing the economy, without a clear lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses factors that influence the public's ability to respond to potential inflationary policies by governments, such as deregulation, globalization, and innovation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on how external factors can affect the public's reaction to inflation. The sentence reflects an understanding of the economic environment and the public's behavior in response to inflation but does not suggest a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments."
0,"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that increasing aggregate demand could prevent a rise in structural unemployment due to sustained high levels of long-term unemployment. This implies a stance in favor of stimulating the economy, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy that aims to ease conditions, such as by lowering interest rates or implementing other expansionary measures. The focus on preventing higher structural unemployment aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
1,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC observed strong growth in consumer spending driven by rising employment and incomes, as well as significant increases in household wealth due to rising stock market and home prices. This description of a robust economic environment suggests that the economy is heating up, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a hope for stability and growth in Europe, focusing on the actions of European authorities rather than indicating a specific direction for U.S. monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve but rather comments on the economic situation abroad and its potential implications. The FOMC's stance here is more observational and does not commit to any particular policy action."
1,"In light of the robust expansion of capital spending thus far this year, the outlook for business investment spending was revised up appreciably, as more of the strength over the latter part of 2004 was attributed to underlying demand and less to the effects of the partial-expensing tax provision.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a strong expansion in capital spending, leading to an upward revision in the outlook for business investment spending. This suggests that the economy is experiencing robust growth, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The mention of underlying demand as a driver, rather than temporary tax provisions, suggests sustained economic strength, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that employment gains were stronger than expected, which could suggest that the economy is performing well and nearing full employment. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to concerns about potential inflationary pressures, as a strong labor market can lead to wage growth and increased spending. Consequently, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reports on positive developments in the labor market, with solid growth in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate. However, it does not directly indicate a future policy action such as tightening or easing. It simply states recent economic data, which could be used to support either a hawkish or dovish stance depending on the broader economic context and the FOMC's assessment of inflation and other indicators."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where interest rates are rising quickly, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The concern about not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve is anticipating the consequences of a higher interest rate environment, which could be due to efforts to control inflation or other economic factors that warrant a reduction in monetary stimulus. The mention of potential problems with congressional response indicates an awareness of the broader implications of such a policy stance."
2,"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a consideration for alternative measures to gauge inflationary pressures beyond the traditional indicator of excess demand. This indicates a nuanced approach to understanding economic signals, which does not directly imply an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced stance, focusing on the assessment of economic conditions rather than signaling a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about the foreign trade component of the economy, with both exports and imports projected to rise due to various factors. It concludes that the net effect on real GDP from the external sector would likely be neutral. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the trade balance's impact on economic growth. It reflects an understanding of economic conditions without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy adjustments."
1,"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants agree on two points: the labor market is very tight, and inflation is significantly higher than the Committee's 2 percent target. A tight labor market could lead to wage growth, which can contribute to inflation. When inflation is above the target, it often prompts the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level. Therefore, the sentence suggests a stance that leans towards tightening monetary policy, which is considered hawkish."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is considering the removal of policy accommodation, which typically means reducing monetary stimulus, such as raising interest rates or decreasing asset purchases. The phrase ""at a pace that would likely be measured"" suggests a gradual tightening of monetary policy. The commitment to respond to economic changes to maintain price stability further reinforces the hawkish stance, as it implies readiness to adjust policy to control inflation."
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) assessment of the neutral level of the federal funds rate and its implications for monetary policy. It acknowledges a lower neutral rate compared to historical averages and the potential constraints posed by the effective lower bound (ELB). The statement also recognizes the downside risks to inflation and employment due to the ELB. This reflects a balanced view, considering both the limitations of monetary policy in the current economic environment and the need to be prepared to address risks to its dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather indicates an awareness of the challenges that may influence future policy decisions."
1,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Home prices continued to rise briskly"" suggests that there is strong upward pressure on the housing market, which can be a sign of inflationary pressures in the economy. Rising home prices can contribute to overall inflation, which the FOMC may seek to control through a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation near its 2% target. Therefore, the sentence indicates a situation that might warrant a hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net"" is a factual statement about market conditions and does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider this information in the context of overall economic conditions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy action."
2,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the complexity of economic forecasting and acknowledges that tax policy changes are just one of many factors influencing growth and inflation projections. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, considering a wide range of economic indicators and conditions."
2,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states that an upturn in foreign economic activity is contingent on the recovery in the United States, which is more of an observation on economic interdependence than a comment on monetary policy actions. It does not provide information on the FOMC's approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Inflation, in fact, is under control, and starting to come down.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not a current concern as it is ""under control, and starting to come down."" This indicates that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment."
1,"Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that firms are experiencing conditions that allow them to raise prices due to strong demand and higher input costs, including tariffs, fuel, and freight expenses. This scenario suggests inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of its key objectives."
1,"During the period examined, the rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI-U for All Items.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the historical inflation rate without indicating a direction for future monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the inflation environment relative to the FOMC's long-term target of 2%."
2,participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a steady, moderate pace of economic activity, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The expectation of moderate growth does not by itself signal a need to adjust monetary policy aggressively in either direction, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
1,"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about the price of oil and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy. The information could be used to assess inflationary pressures or economic conditions, but the sentence itself does not convey a clear policy direction."
2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy in the context of global financial integration, rather than indicating a current or future direction of policy. It reflects a consideration of external factors that might influence the transmission of monetary policy but does not in itself suggest a stance towards tightening or easing. The focus is on understanding the dynamics of cross-border capital flows and their impact on domestic interest rates, which is a neutral inquiry into the challenges faced by the FOMC in achieving its goals."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. economic activity has been revised upward, suggesting an improvement in economic conditions. This could imply that the economy is performing better than previously expected, which may lead to increased inflationary pressures. In response to stronger economic activity, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
2,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's process of reviewing and potentially updating its monetary policy framework in response to economic developments. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance of tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a commitment to adapt and improve policy tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability. The focus is on learning from past experiences and preparing for future challenges, which is a neutral position in terms of immediate policy direction."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's future decisions on the pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction will be data-dependent, reflecting a stance that is neither explicitly in favor of tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy. It suggests a wait-and-see approach, where actions will be based on the economic conditions relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical observation about the methodology of studies concerning price indexes and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests imminent policy actions nor provides insight into the Committee's views on economic conditions relative to its goals of maximum employment and price stability."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economic activity was stronger than expected at the end of 1996 and continued into 1997. This could suggest that the economy is heating up, which might lead to inflationary pressures. In response to strong economic activity, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Therefore, the stance is hawkish as it implies a potential move towards tightening monetary policy."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between public inflation expectations and actual inflation outcomes, emphasizing the importance of stable expectations in achieving low and stable inflation. It does not directly indicate an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather underscores the role of expectations in the inflation process. The statement is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests that as long as inflation expectations are well-anchored, the FOMC's current policy stance may be appropriate, absent major economic shocks."
1,"Monetary policy clearly can do little about the first-round effects of a permanent rise in energy prices, which include both its direct impact on the energy component of overall consumer prices and the pass-through of higher energy costs into prices of non-energy goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the limitations of monetary policy in addressing the immediate impacts of a permanent increase in energy prices on both direct energy costs and the subsequent pass-through to non-energy goods and services. It does not indicate a specific direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the constraints faced by the FOMC in responding to certain economic disturbances. This reflects an understanding of the FOMC's goals and the challenges in achieving them when faced with external shocks that are not easily mitigated by monetary policy adjustments."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not widespread across the economy, which implies that there may not be a pressing need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. This could be interpreted as a sign that the FOMC might lean towards maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, rather than raising interest rates to curb inflation."
2,"There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates, compared to previous expansions","HAWKISH

The sentence points out an ""unusual discrepancy"" between low unemployment and capacity utilization rates compared to previous economic expansions. This could be interpreted as a sign of potential overheating in the economy, where high employment and high capacity utilization might lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this situation might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
2,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation stating how long it took for employment and inflation to return to levels consistent with the FOMC's mandate after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past economic recovery without suggesting a particular direction for future policy."
0,"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a reluctance to tighten monetary policy due to the belief that inflation is temporary and that acting too aggressively could hinder economic recovery. This indicates a preference for maintaining or easing the current policy stance to support the economy, rather than prioritizing immediate measures to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,"With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus crop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a regional economic update, which is a common part of FOMC discussions as they assess various sectors and regions to get a comprehensive view of the economy. Discussing Florida's citrus crop, tourism, and real estate prices does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy but rather provides context for decision-making. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence it is neutral."
1,"In particular, investors noted that the Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors, retained its earlier balance of risks assessment, and reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee acknowledges the recent increase in inflation and suggests a gradual removal of policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases. This approach is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to address inflation, even if some of the inflationary pressures are considered transitory. The use of ""measured"" implies a cautious but deliberate path towards less accommodative policy, aligning with the goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where technological advances in biotechnology are leading to productivity improvements across various sectors. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic developments that could influence productivity and, potentially, long-term economic growth. The FOMC might consider such information when making future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance. It is more of an observation of economic conditions rather than a directive or hint about future policy actions."
2,continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012"" does not explicitly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation of economic growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The statement is forward-looking and suggests a balanced view on the economic outlook without signaling a direct action on monetary policy."
2,"However, several participants pointed out that the 3-month change in that index had firmed recently, signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a recent firming in a particular index, which is interpreted by several participants as a sign of improvement in the inflation outlook. This suggests that inflationary pressures may be rising, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding their target. A tightening stance is typically associated with a hawkish policy approach, as it aims to control inflation, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower. This indicates that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more than what is currently anticipated. The use of the word ""balanced"" implies that they believe the current policy stance is appropriate to maintain their inflation target and does not signal a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy."
2,"another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it references the consideration of academic research on the relationship between learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy, which is part of the FOMC's ongoing efforts to understand economic mechanisms and inform their decisions. This reflects a balanced approach to policy-making, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to being informed by a range of indicators and analyses."
2,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But what does this mean for monetary policy?"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It is a question that suggests a consideration or assessment is to follow, but without additional context, it does not indicate a clear stance toward tightening, easing, or maintaining the current policy. It reflects a neutral position, awaiting further details or analysis."
1,"subsequently moved up against the backdrop of an improving global growth outlook, higher commodity prices, depreciation of the dollar, and the stronger-than-expected reading on core inflation in the December CPI release.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are several factors contributing to an environment where inflation could rise: improving global growth, higher commodity prices, a depreciating dollar, and a stronger-than-expected core inflation reading. These factors suggest upward pressure on inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"Key factors that influence consumer spending--including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households' net worth--were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates positive economic conditions, such as a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and high levels of household net worth, which are expected to support a solid pace of consumer spending in the near term. This suggests that the economy is strong, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This type of communication strategy is typically used to influence the pricing of longer-term interest rates, making them more predictable and stable, which in turn can support economic activity by providing favorable borrowing conditions. This dovish stance implies a policy geared towards easing rather than tightening, as it indicates a commitment to maintaining low interest rates to support maximum employment and stable prices, in line with the FOMC's goals."
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants have increased their inflation projections because they believe supply constraints in product and labor markets are more significant and persistent than they initially thought. This suggests a concern for higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the central bank has raised interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down economic activity and prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"The expansion of M2 had declined substantially since late spring, apparently in part as a result of the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from higher market interest rates and possibly also from slackening growth in household incomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the growth of the money supply (M2) has slowed down due to higher market interest rates, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. Higher interest rates typically reflect a central bank's effort to control inflation and could lead to a reduction in liquidity and slower economic growth, aligning with a hawkish stance. The reference to ""widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2"" implies that the returns on alternative investments have become more attractive compared to the returns on M2 assets, which is consistent with the effects of higher interest rates."
0,"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking action to increase the availability of dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions by expanding swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank, and even removing formal quantity limits. This action is aimed at easing monetary conditions by providing liquidity, which is a dovish policy stance typically associated with stimulating economic activity and supporting financial markets during times of stress. It does not suggest tightening of monetary policy, but rather an effort to ensure that dollar funding needs are met, which can help in maintaining financial stability and supporting the FOMC's broader economic goals."
2,"Further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the technological gap in productivity, which is an observation on the state of technology adaptation within firms and its impact on productivity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an analysis of factors that could influence productivity and, indirectly, economic growth and employment. This information might be used to inform FOMC decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
2,"On balance, most participants still expected inflation to moderate later this year and in 2009.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants expect inflation to decrease in the future, which implies that there may be less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy. This expectation of moderating inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a belief that inflationary pressures will ease, potentially reducing the urgency to increase interest rates to combat inflation."
1,"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve intends to slow the pace of asset purchases as reserves reach sufficiently high levels. This suggests a move towards tightening monetary policy by reducing the amount of monetary stimulus being injected into the economy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The action aligns with the goal of preventing an overheating economy that could lead to inflation exceeding the target rate. Slowing asset purchases is a method to gradually reduce support and avoid excessive inflationary pressures, while still aiming to maintain stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on discussing empirical evidence regarding the impact of asset price changes on consumption and investment, which does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a neutral, fact-finding approach that the FOMC might use to inform future policy decisions."
1,The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a consensus view on the relationship between price stability and other monetary policy goals, without indicating a specific direction for policy action. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather acknowledges a general principle agreed upon by economists and central bankers."
0,"These participants cited, for example, the still-elevated levels of long-term unemployment and workers employed part time for economic reasons as well as low labor force participation.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights concerns about high levels of long-term unemployment, part-time workers who would prefer full-time work, and low labor force participation. These issues suggest that the economy is not operating at full capacity, which aligns with a dovish stance that would support an easing of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and move towards maximum employment."
0,"Employment had risen a little,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Employment had risen a little,"" on its own, does not provide a clear indication of a shift towards a more restrictive or more accommodative monetary policy stance. It simply states a fact about employment levels, which is one of the FOMC's key concerns. Without additional context on whether this change in employment is above or below the Committee's expectations or how it relates to their maximum employment goal, it is not possible to determine a clear policy direction. Therefore, the statement is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly if there is a risk of inflationary pressures, indicating a stance towards preventing inflation rather than promoting easier monetary conditions. This aligns with a hawkish approach, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth."
2,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC expects rapid gains in structural productivity, which would likely keep unit labor costs from rising significantly. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need to ease monetary policy to stimulate the economy, as productivity gains could help maintain price stability without additional monetary intervention. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this expectation could lead to a tighter monetary policy stance if it means that inflation pressures are mitigated through increased productivity rather than through policy action."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing unemployment and addressing the negative impacts of long-term joblessness. This suggests a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job creation and prevent the adverse effects of prolonged unemployment, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes boosting economic activity and employment over concerns about inflation."
0,"And I think, more broadly, monetary policy is also supporting household spending and home buying by keeping the labor market strong, keeping workers’ incomes rising, and keeping consumer confidence at high levels, where it currently is.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy is being used to support household spending and home buying, which suggests an accommodative stance aimed at keeping the labor market strong and consumer confidence high. This implies a focus on stimulating economic activity rather than containing inflation or preventing the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, showing that the FOMC is attentive to inflation trends, which is consistent with their mandate for stable prices. The commitment to monitoring suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed, but it does not reveal any immediate intention to either raise or lower interest rates."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of how interest rate changes impact various economic factors such as asset prices, household wealth, exchange rates, net exports, and import prices. It also compares the understanding and historical testing of short-term rate effects with balance sheet policies. This is a descriptive statement about the mechanics of monetary policy rather than an indication of a current or future policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the transmission mechanisms of policy tools."
0,"Consistent with the optimism driving stock prices, spreads of corporate bond yields over comparable-maturity Treasury yields narrowed markedly across the credit spectrum, most notably for debt securities of the lowest credit quality firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically the narrowing of spreads between corporate bond yields and Treasury yields, which indicates increased investor confidence and a positive market outlook. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather reports on observed financial market trends. The FOMC might consider such information in its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
2,"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the importance of inflation expectations as an input into monetary policy assessment, alongside the natural rate of unemployment (u*) and the neutral rate of interest (r*). It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy but rather emphasizes the role of inflation expectations in the decision-making process. This reflects a balanced approach to considering how expectations might influence future inflation and, consequently, monetary policy actions. It does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy, but rather the importance of monitoring this factor."
0,But equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of equity prices and the value of the dollar without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It simply states that equity prices are stable after a decline and that the dollar had appreciated, which could be the result of various factors, not necessarily a change in monetary policy. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target temporarily. This approach suggests that the FOMC is focused on ensuring that inflation does not fall persistently below its long-term goal, which could necessitate a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent inflation from becoming too high or unanchored. By aiming for inflation above 2 percent for some time, the FOMC is signaling its readiness to potentially tighten policy in the future to manage inflation expectations and achieve its long-term objectives."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an opinion held by a group of economists regarding the relationship between monetary policy and financial market bubbles, but it does not directly indicate a current or future stance of monetary policy tightening or easing by the FOMC. It is a statement of belief rather than a description of policy action, and as such, it does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish direction. It is neutral in the context of classifying the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
0,"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members are looking for further improvement in the labor market before considering a reduction in the pace of asset purchases. Asset purchases are typically used to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest rates, supporting more borrowing and spending. The fact that they are not ready to slow these purchases indicates a stance towards maintaining an accommodative monetary policy to support employment, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail about their monetary policy tools rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather indicates a continuation of a previously established policy. The focus on maintaining certain growth ranges for monetary aggregates is consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but without additional context on whether these targets represent a change from previous policy, the stance is neutral."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an educational statement that describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate and does not provide any specific information on current monetary policy actions or stances. It does not indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the overarching goals of the Federal Reserve."
2,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members' assessments of the economic outlook have not significantly changed since their previous meeting. This suggests that they are maintaining their current stance on monetary policy rather than signaling a shift towards tightening or easing. It reflects a balanced view without a clear inclination to adjust policy in response to changes in employment or inflation, thus fitting a NEUTRAL classification."
1,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the consumer price index (CPI) has risen, particularly due to an increase in consumer energy prices. This suggests inflationary pressures, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the compatibility of inflation targeting with various social priorities on inflation and unemployment, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustment. It is a theoretical observation on policy frameworks rather than a statement of intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
1,"The rationale for monetary policy tightening is, in my judgment, quite straightforward and flows from two assessments about the current state of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a justification for tightening monetary policy, which typically means increasing interest rates to control inflation and slow down economic activity. This stance is consistent with a response to an economy that may be overheating or experiencing high inflation, which would require action to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The use of ""quite straightforward"" suggests a clear and determined approach to addressing the current economic assessments, which likely relate to deviations from the target inflation rate or concerns about labor market tightness."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the role of inflation in driving financial innovations in Brazil, which helped firms and households to economize on cash balances. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it reflects on the consequences of inflation in another country's context, without suggesting any immediate policy action or change in the stance of the Federal Reserve."
0,"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about consumer spending patterns without directly suggesting a need for a change in monetary policy. It indicates that since consumer spending remained strong during the downturn, there isn't a backlog of consumer demand that would typically drive a post-recovery surge. This assessment does not inherently call for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides context for understanding the economic situation."
0,"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","DOVISH

The sentence describes the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity and employment, which suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to implement or maintain an easing monetary policy stance to support the economy and counteract the downturn caused by the pandemic. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, indicating a focus on stimulating economic activity rather than tightening policy to combat inflation."
2,"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of house price trends in various economies where central banks have indicated a focus on asset prices. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve but rather comments on the phenomena observed in the housing market in relation to central bank attention to asset prices. This statement is more of a reflection on external economic conditions and the responses of other central banks, without a clear indication of the FOMC's own policy stance."
1,"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes strong demand and a very tight labor market as contributing factors to inflation pressures. The mention of removing ""extraordinary monetary policy accommodation"" suggests that the FOMC is considering tightening monetary policy to address these inflationary concerns. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions or communications that suggest a move towards higher interest rates or a reduction in monetary policy support to control inflation and stabilize prices, consistent with the FOMC's goals."
0,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services narrowed somewhat in August from a high rate in July,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation regarding the U.S. trade balance without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides information on economic conditions that could be one of many factors considered by the FOMC in their decision-making process."
2,"The course of underlying inflation pressures was more difficult to gauge, however.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests uncertainty in assessing inflation pressures, which means the FOMC might be in a wait-and-see mode, neither clearly indicating a move towards raising rates (hawkish) nor towards cutting them (dovish). The statement reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of indicators before making a policy decision."
1,"As always, our actions are guided by our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Reserve's commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, which are its core objectives. It does not provide specific information on the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing) but rather reaffirms the guiding principles behind the FOMC's actions."
1,"Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of inflation on different income groups, particularly highlighting the challenges faced by lower- and moderate-income individuals. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the social and economic effects of inflation, which is a concern for the FOMC. However, without additional context on policy intentions, the sentence remains neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
1,"As the factors restraining economic growth are projected to fade further over time, the median rate rises to 3 percent by the end of 2018, close to its longer-run normal level.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising interest rates, approaching what is considered a ""normal"" level in the longer run. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The FOMC may be anticipating stronger economic growth that could lead to inflationary pressures, thus justifying an increase in rates to maintain price stability, one of their key objectives."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of how past changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar might affect the demand for U.S. exports and the substitution of imports for domestic products. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses the economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus is on the impact of exchange rates on trade balance rather than on immediate monetary policy actions."
2,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context and rationale for the structure of the FOMC, explaining the benefits of a committee approach in terms of information aggregation and diversity of perspectives. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it is considered neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the equilibrium real rate in the context of long-term economic balance, considering secular forces like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of understanding a fundamental economic concept that guides the FOMC's long-term policy setting. The equilibrium real rate is a theoretical construct that helps the Committee gauge the appropriate stance of policy over the longer run but does not in itself suggest a current policy shift."
1,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members expect inflation to decrease in the near future, which implies that there may be less need for aggressive tightening of monetary policy. This expectation of moderating inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a potential easing of concerns about high inflation and, therefore, potentially less impetus to raise interest rates."
1,The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for increasing inflation pressures and suggests that further tightening of monetary policy might be required to manage labor costs and prices. This implies a stance towards raising interest rates or taking other actions to restrict monetary conditions, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to control inflation."
2,"as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that headline PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation will be significantly higher than core PCE price inflation. Headline PCE includes more volatile items such as food and energy, which can be influenced by external factors. However, a substantial exceedance of headline PCE over core PCE suggests rising inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could signal a need for tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the components of economic growth, with investment improving and potentially balancing a moderation in household spending. It does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather observes changes in economic activity. The balanced nature of the expansion aligns with the FOMC's goals of sustainable growth, but the statement does not suggest immediate policy action."
1,"The members concluded that retaining a risk statement weighted toward more inflation pressures would best represent their current thinking, but they believed it was desirable to provide some recognition of the emergence of increased downside risks to the economic expansion in the statement to be released after this meeting.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are more concerned about inflation pressures, which suggests they are considering a tighter monetary policy stance to combat potential inflation. The mention of ""retaining a risk statement weighted toward more inflation pressures"" implies a focus on controlling inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. While they acknowledge increased downside risks to economic expansion, the priority given to inflation concerns suggests a readiness to potentially raise interest rates or take other measures to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"As is evident in the right-hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the relationship between growth differentials and capital inflows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the Federal Reserve is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that could be one of many factors considered in their decision-making process."
2,"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see recent lower inflation readings as potentially temporary and are looking at alternative measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, which has been stable around the target rate. This suggests a balanced view on inflation, neither clearly signaling an immediate need to tighten nor to ease monetary policy, but rather to maintain the current stance while monitoring the situation."
0,PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price inflation is expected to remain significantly above the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent by the end of the year. This suggests that inflation is running hotter than desired, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,The U. S. international trade deficit declined somewhat in May after reaching a record high in April.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports a fact about the U.S. international trade deficit without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy or indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response to this information."
0,The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a projection about global economic growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It provides context about the economic environment but does not suggest a specific policy action or change."
2,"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method for assessing inflation by excluding volatile food and energy prices to get a better sense of underlying inflation pressures. This approach is a common practice known as looking at ""core inflation,"" which helps the FOMC understand the persistent and dominant trends in inflation over time. The sentence itself does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an analytical technique used to gauge inflationary trends. This information would be used in conjunction with other data to inform policy decisions aimed at achieving the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from the Congress to pursue policies that aim to achieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, which is to achieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability. It does not provide any specific direction on monetary policy actions or indicate a change in policy stance. It is a factual statement about the objectives of the Federal Reserve rather than a comment on current economic conditions or future policy moves."
1,A few participants argued that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy over the medium run would erode the stability of inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants are concerned that a prolonged period of very accommodative monetary policy could lead to instability in inflation expectations. This implies a belief that there may be a need to tighten monetary policy to prevent such instability and maintain the inflation target, which is a hawkish stance."
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in focus from concerns about rising inflation to concerns about economic weakness. This suggests a potential easing of monetary policy to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance. The absence of a balanced risk assessment implies that the Committee is more concerned with supporting growth than with combating inflation at this point."
2,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a perceived shift towards a more balanced risk outlook, with neither a clear indication of an impending tightening nor an easing of monetary policy. It suggests that domestic demand risks have increased, which could be inflationary (potentially hawkish), but also notes a reduction in foreign risks, which could be stabilizing (potentially dovish). The balance between these two observations does not clearly signal a move towards a more aggressive or more accommodative stance, thus it is neutral."
0,"Of course, the cost of this critical stabilization was the high unemployment and lost output associated with the sharp 1981-82 recession.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on the historical context of the economic conditions during the 1981-82 recession, describing the consequences of past stabilization efforts which included high unemployment and lost output. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation of the trade-offs associated with past policy decisions."
0,We think that the economy will need highly accommodative monetary policy and the use of our tools for an extended period.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes the economy requires a continued and extended application of very supportive monetary policy measures. This suggests that the FOMC is inclined to keep interest rates low and possibly engage in other stimulative actions to support the economy, which is consistent with a dovish stance that aims to stimulate economic activity and employment."
1,"Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation pressures could rise significantly if the economy grows too quickly, potentially due to fiscal stimulus or easy financial conditions. This suggests that the FOMC might consider a more aggressive series of interest rate increases to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy."
1,"Measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early January, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where longer-term inflation expectations have slightly increased but are still not high compared to historical levels. This observation does not clearly indicate a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It suggests that inflation expectations are somewhat contained, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement does not provide enough context to determine a clear direction for policy change, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,"The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an assessment of economic conditions, specifically regarding productivity and growth potential. This assessment could be used to inform future policy decisions, but on its own, it does not suggest an immediate action towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance. It is a neutral observation that could lead to various policy responses depending on how the FOMC weighs this information against other economic indicators and their policy objectives."
2,"In contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the Desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of how the Federal Reserve's trading desk (the Desk) conducts open-market operations, specifically the use of repurchase agreements (repos) to manage temporary variations in the demand for reserves or changes in reserve supply. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a method of operational implementation to maintain the desired level of reserves. This is a part of the regular toolkit the Fed uses to manage liquidity in the banking system and does not inherently signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that current negotiations for wages and prices are incorporating expectations of future inflation. This suggests that there is an anticipation of inflationary pressures, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflation and maintain price stability, which is one of the FOMC's primary goals."
1,"Core price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising core price inflation, partly due to higher import prices. This suggests that there may be upward pressure on inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check and achieve its target of 2% over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation."
2,"To provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, I draw your attention to a speech that Chairman Greenspan made earlier this year, entitled ""Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy"" (Greenspan, 2004).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is referencing a speech by former Chairman Greenspan on the topics of risk and uncertainty in monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions such as tightening or easing. Instead, it seems to be setting the stage for a discussion or providing context for an argument, without revealing a clear direction towards hawkish or dovish policy adjustments."
0,A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence explains a technical reason for an expected change in inflation readings due to the base effect (where unusually low inflation figures from the previous year drop out of the 12-month calculation), rather than indicating a policy stance. It does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context for interpreting upcoming inflation data."
0,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of current economic conditions, specifically the decline in commodity prices due to softer demand from emerging markets and Europe. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic factors that could influence the FOMC's decision-making. The statement is more about the state of the economy and less about a policy stance."
