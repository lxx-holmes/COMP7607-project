2,"Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of globalization on inflation and the performance of the standard model in predicting inflation trends. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexities of understanding inflation dynamics, which is a neutral observation rather than a policy direction."
1,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the central bank has raised interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down economic activity and prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, in this framework, the current period appears to be an outlier.4 That is, even after factoring in the current-cycle dynamics of strong profit growth and relatively modest investment, a good part of the rise in liquid assets remains unaccounted for--as much as one half of the total rise in cash-to-assets--according to Federal Reserve staff estimates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an observation regarding the rise in liquid assets that remains unexplained even after considering current economic dynamics. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of financial conditions that could be used to inform future policy decisions. The mention of ""strong profit growth and relatively modest investment"" alongside the unaccounted rise in liquid assets does not inherently suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance without additional context on how the FOMC might respond to these conditions."
0,"Given the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, there is a dispute on how widely productivity implicit in the information revolution has spread across the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in measuring productivity increases by industry and the extent to which the information revolution has affected productivity across the economy. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexities of economic measurement, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
1,"Expectations of price increases over the near-term--specifically, over the next year--have, in fact, risen noticeably on the heels of the actual increase in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is an observed rise in both the expectations of price increases in the near term and the actual inflation. This suggests that there is upward pressure on inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check and achieve its target of 2% over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability."
2,"In that regard, the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges that changes in the macroeconomic environment will be considered during the monetary policy review, which could have implications for financial stability. This suggests a balanced approach, weighing the potential impacts on financial stability as part of their ongoing assessment, without committing to a specific policy action."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the adequacy of current techniques to measure inflation in the future, which is a methodological issue rather than a direct indication of the current monetary policy stance. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to the need for improved measurement tools to ensure the effectiveness of future policy decisions. The focus is on the accuracy of data used to inform policy rather than on the policy direction itself."
1,"Even with generous allowances for structural change, labor utilization would seem to be at a level that might eventually begin to put persistent and growing pressure on labor costs and prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current level of labor utilization might lead to increasing pressure on labor costs and prices, which could result in higher inflation. This implies a concern for inflationary pressures that would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,This role is largely a reflection of the New York Fed's responsibility for implementing monetary policy decisions through its open market desk operations.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the operational aspect of the Federal Reserve, specifically the New York Fed's role in implementing monetary policy decisions through open market operations. It does not directly indicate a stance on the direction of monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather explains a procedural detail of how policy decisions are executed."
2,"In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the correlation between different estimates of the natural rate of interest (r*) and expected inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that these indicators have moved in tandem over time, which does not inherently suggest a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on the behavior of economic indicators rather than on policy prescriptions."
2,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the monetary policy was in line with the Taylor Rule, which is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, but it also states that the nominal federal funds rate remained unchanged. This suggests a balance between following a rule-based approach and maintaining the status quo, which does not clearly signal a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a stance that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather one that maintains current conditions while being informed by a policy rule."
2,"Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure 1 is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line represents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average inflation will be between 2009 and 2014.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a method for estimating market inflation expectations and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is simply providing an explanation of how inflation expectations are being interpreted for a specific time period, which is a part of the overall analysis the FOMC uses to inform their policy decisions."
2,"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of housing price trends in various economies and the central banks' focus on asset prices. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. Instead, it reflects on the economic phenomena that central banks monitor, which is part of their broader mandate to ensure financial stability. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC will adjust the federal funds rate or change its monetary policy tools in response to the housing price trajectories."
2,The uncertainty about the threshold unemployment rate also suggests a differing degree of intensity in the response of monetary policy to deviations of inflation and output to their respective targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty regarding the natural rate of unemployment and how this uncertainty affects the intensity of the monetary policy response to deviations in inflation and output. It does not explicitly suggest a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity in balancing policy responses to achieve the dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. The statement reflects a consideration of the trade-offs in policy-making without committing to a specific course of action."
2,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.2 Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's actions to align its policy statement and forward guidance with the new monetary policy framework adopted in August 2020. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the alignment of policy tools with the updated framework. The focus is on the consistency of recent decisions with the new strategy, without specifying whether these decisions are leading to more hawkish or dovish outcomes."
1,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the macroeconomic data has been stronger than expected, with a significant rebound in GDP growth. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, strong economic data might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,These decisions can then push up prices even more and make inflation harder to get under control.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that certain decisions could lead to higher inflation, which suggests a need for a tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming more difficult to control. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors measures to combat rising inflation, often through increasing interest rates or other forms of monetary tightening."
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target, suggesting that if inflation has been persistently below this level, the Committee is prepared to allow it to run moderately above 2 percent for some time to balance out the previous shortfall. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, reflecting a hawkish stance."
2,"However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the central bank's flexibility in shifting its focus between the price of reserves and the quantity or growth of reserves. This statement does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general principle regarding the tools and approaches a central bank may use to achieve its objectives. It does not provide specific information on the direction of policy in relation to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,Consider a price increase for a breakfast cereal that increases the prices of both the brand-name cereal and the corresponding lower-priced store-brand cereal but maintains a differential between them.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario of price changes in a specific market segment (breakfast cereals) without directly indicating a broader inflationary trend or suggesting a specific monetary policy action. It does not explicitly state whether the Federal Reserve should tighten or ease monetary policy in response to this price increase. The sentence merely observes a market phenomenon where both a brand-name and a store-brand cereal experience a price increase while maintaining a price differential, which could be due to various nonmonetary factors. This does not provide enough context to determine a clear stance on monetary policy."
0,"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the prices of exports and the balance of trade between countries, which is influenced by foreign exchange markets. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation on international trade dynamics, which could be a factor the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. However, the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that delaying the adjustment towards the neutral interest rate could lead to negative outcomes such as excessive inflation or financial instability. This suggests a bias towards tightening monetary policy to prevent such risks, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Despite the prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4 In contrast, as noted, study of the role of committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5 Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to policymaking.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the academic attention given to the study of monetary policy rules and the role of committees in formulating policy, rather than indicating a specific direction of monetary policy stance. It is more focused on the historical and academic context of policy formulation rather than current policy actions or intentions."
1,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have also picked up.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, which suggests that expectations for future inflation are rising. This could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract potential inflationary pressures, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation expectations is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing a factual statement about how equities are evaluated in financial markets, specifically mentioning the use of the price-earnings ratio as a standard benchmark for assessing a stock's valuation. It does not directly indicate any particular stance on monetary policy or suggest any actions related to tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. It does not reflect on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the core concerns of the FOMC when determining their monetary policy stance."
1,"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate to achieve price stability and full employment, which are its core objectives. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather states the overall goals of the institution. The focus on both price stability and full employment suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that a weak labor market will prevent significant increases in employment costs, which implies that inflationary pressures from wages are likely to remain subdued. This could indicate that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to stimulate employment."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy nor comments on the current economic conditions in the United States that would warrant a change in the monetary policy stance. Instead, it provides an observation on the international economic environment."
2,"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states that the FOMC has multiple forecasts at its disposal when making monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information about economic conditions such as employment, inflation, or interest rates. It reflects a general statement about the policy-making process rather than a stance on future policy moves."
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target, suggesting that if inflation has been persistently below this level, the Committee is prepared to allow it to run moderately above 2 percent for some time to balance out the average. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, reflecting a hawkish stance."
1,"As we gain experience with the enhanced forecasts, we will continue to evaluate how best to promote stability of both prices and employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to evaluating and potentially adjusting the approach to forecasting as part of the FOMC's ongoing efforts to promote price stability and maximum employment. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a focus on improving the tools used to achieve the dual mandate. The emphasis is on the process of evaluation and adaptation, which is consistent with a balanced and data-driven approach to policy-making."
1,In this case headline inflation will rise well above its underlying trend as the price of energy rises,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that headline inflation is expected to rise significantly above its underlying trend due to increasing energy prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures are building, which could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the technical aspects of how price indexes are weighted and calculated across different income groups, rather than indicating a direction for monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the current economic conditions of employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral statement focused on the methodology of economic analysis rather than policy stance."
0,"Less uncertainty about future inflation could lower the risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds, lowering the risk-free interest rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential outcome of reduced uncertainty about future inflation, which could lead to lower risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds and thus a decrease in the risk-free interest rate. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a possible effect on interest rates based on market perceptions of inflation risk. It reflects an understanding of how expectations and market dynamics can influence economic conditions, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of monitoring a range of indicators and balancing risks."
2,"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation about the relationship between two measures of excess demand, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context for understanding economic indicators."
2,"But before I comment on productivity, I'd like to begin with a review of recent economic developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory statement that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply indicates that a review of recent economic developments will be discussed, which is a standard part of FOMC statements before delving into details about the economy and policy decisions."
2,"When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, in large part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that long-term interest rates are rising due to expectations of higher short-term interest rates, which typically occur when the central bank is expected to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation or overheating in the economy. This suggests a stance that is more inclined towards tightening rather than easing, aligning with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
2,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the underlying economic theory, suggesting that the fundamental interactions between demand, potential supply, and expectations remain consistent despite the recent trend of globalization. This statement is more about the understanding of economic dynamics than a direct indication of policy action."
2,"For example, although a number of features of Brazilian law promote the independence of the nation's central bank, the bank's de facto independence may be limited by the power of the president to remove members of the Monetary Policy Committee.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the independence of Brazil's central bank and the potential limitations imposed by the president's power to remove members of the Monetary Policy Committee. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the direction of interest rates, inflation, or employment levels. Instead, it focuses on the governance structure of the central bank, which is a separate issue from the specific monetary policy actions that would be classified as hawkish or dovish."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential development of financial market instruments and analytical techniques to measure changes in the general price level, which is related to inflation tracking. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a neutral, informative perspective on the possible evolution of financial analysis tools, which could help the FOMC in achieving its inflation-related goals."
2,"Venezuela provides one counterexample, with a long-term inflation forecast now of 15 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence merely states an observation about Venezuela's inflation forecast without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest any specific action or stance the FOMC should take in response to U.S. economic conditions, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States."
2,"Despite some recent turbulence, owing in part to geopolitical events, stock prices have logged robust gains over the past 3-1/2 years, and broad equity indices have now retraced most of the ground lost between 2000 and 2002.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of stock market performance and does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states that despite recent challenges, the stock market has recovered from past losses, which is a neutral comment regarding the FOMC's monetary policy actions."
0,"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is no immediate need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy due to the absence of increasing inflation pressures. This suggests a stance towards easing, or at least not tightening, as there is no urgency to adjust demand to match potential output, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
0,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a theoretical approach to monetary policy, suggesting that a constant rate of money growth could stabilize inflation and the business cycle under certain conditions (stable and not particularly interest-sensitive money demand). It does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather describes a general principle that could guide policy decisions. The focus is on the long-term control of inflation and short-term smoothing of the business cycle, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates without specifying a current policy change."
1,"I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the potential impact of a hypothetical situation (a sharp rise in the price of oil) on the U.S. economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring economic conditions and challenges that could influence their policy decisions. The question suggests that the FOMC is considering how external shocks, such as oil price fluctuations, could affect inflation and economic stability, which are key concerns in their mandate. However, without additional context on the FOMC's response or interpretation of the consequences, the policy stance remains unclear from this sentence alone."
1,"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation pressures intensify or if inflation expectations rise above the target level. This suggests a willingness to increase interest rates or take other contractionary measures to maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism by which monetary policy influences the economy, specifically through financial markets, and acknowledges the role of asset prices as indicators of expectations and risks. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the transmission of policy effects and the importance of market signals in understanding economic conditions. This reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and data-driven decision-making."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the 2% target by a significant margin (at or above 3%). The speaker's readiness to consider this as more than a ""moderate"" overshoot suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) main instrument for conducting monetary policy without indicating a direction for future policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it give insight into the Committee's current assessment of the economy in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"the approach can be applied equally well by ""inflation hawks,"" ""growth hawks,"" and anyone in between.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it suggests that the approach mentioned can be utilized by individuals with different policy priorities, whether they are more concerned with controlling inflation (""inflation hawks"") or promoting growth (""growth hawks""). This indicates a balanced perspective that does not lean towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance."
0,The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a forecast of economic indicators, specifically unemployment and inflation rates, without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It indicates an expectation of progress towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not explicitly state whether the Committee will respond with tightening or easing measures. The projection itself is neutral, as it simply outlines anticipated economic conditions."
2,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a belief in the compatibility of full employment and price stability over the long term, which is a fundamental principle of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms a general principle that guides the FOMC's approach to policy-making. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it simply acknowledges the long-term goals without providing specific guidance on current or future policy adjustments."
1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is prepared to tighten monetary policy if the economy shows signs of overheating and inflation rises to an undesirably high level. This suggests a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes the control of inflation."
2,"We include these types of price terms today in our forecasting equations, and they are important to forming our views of the inflation outlook and thus to the policy process.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the inclusion of certain price terms in forecasting equations, which are important for forming views on the inflation outlook and influencing the policy process. This statement does not explicitly indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather explains a component of the analytical process used to inform policy decisions. It reflects a commitment to data-driven decision-making, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about financial imbalances potentially becoming more closely associated with the business cycle due to a combination of a low neutral interest rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation. The call to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle implies a recognition of the limits of monetary policy in this context and a potential readiness to tighten monetary policy if needed to prevent such imbalances, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing inflation and maintaining financial stability."
1,"Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by “jawboning,” guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policymakers are prepared to use additional tools to combat and control inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of ""incomes policies,"" ""jawboning,"" guideposts, and price and wage controls as measures to address inflation implies a proactive approach to preventing an increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"Relative to the average episode, commercial real estate prices neither fell much during the recession nor rose a lot during the expansion.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about commercial real estate prices, noting that they did not experience significant declines during a recession or substantial increases during an expansion. This statement does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of past market conditions in the commercial real estate sector, which is one of many economic indicators the FOMC might consider. The sentence does not suggest an immediate concern for inflationary pressure or employment shortfalls that would prompt a change in monetary policy stance."
1,Our Congressional mandate is to achieve full employment and price stability in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence states the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of achieving full employment and price stability, which is a general policy goal rather than an indication of a specific monetary policy stance. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms its overall objectives."
2,"And I'm pleased to have the opportunity to share with you, the students of South Dakota State University (SDSU), my experience as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and my outlook for the U.S. economy.1 Today I will speak to you about my outlook for the U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve has been doing to support economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply states the speaker's intention to share their experience and outlook, as well as discuss the Federal Reserve's actions during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery. There is no indication of a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general principle or belief that stable and consistent price measurement is possible, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of price stability. It does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions or indicate a shift in the current policy stance."
2,"another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the consideration of academic research on the relationship between learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an interest in understanding how these factors interact, which could inform future policy decisions. The focus on research and learning suggests a balanced approach to policy formulation, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to being informed by a range of indicators and analysis."
2,"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential complications and questions that could arise from selecting a range for inflation targets without specifying a preferred point within that range. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather addresses considerations in policy communication and target setting. The focus is on the clarity and implications of policy decisions rather than immediate action to adjust monetary conditions."
2,"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing an intention to discuss findings and implications from a review in the context of the FOMC's new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a communication of policy framework and strategy. The focus is on transparency and explanation of policy implications, which is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to clear communication but does not in itself suggest a change in policy direction."
1,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where public expectations of low inflation lead to moderate wage-setting and pricing behavior, which in turn helps the Federal Reserve maintain low inflation. This reflects a balanced view of the relationship between public expectations and the Fed's ability to achieve its inflation target. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather emphasizes the importance of managing expectations to maintain price stability."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather a balanced approach to achieving the stated goals."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant decrease in core consumer price inflation (CPI), which suggests that inflationary pressures are diminishing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflation rate is moving away from the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. In response to lower inflation, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent deflationary risks, aligning with its mandate for stable prices."
2,"These productivity gains result from many forces, including business investment that has increased the amount and quality of capital available to the workforce, business process innovations, and the growth of innovative, research-intensive industries such as information technology and biotechnology.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes factors contributing to productivity gains, such as business investment, innovations, and growth in certain industries, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions."
1,This is an example of offsetting the attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a more aggressive response to inflation realizations, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to address higher inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a priority on controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down economic growth or output."
0,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to tolerate a higher inflation rate in exchange for a lower unemployment rate. This indicates a preference for easing monetary policy to support employment, even at the cost of allowing inflation to rise above the target level, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes but rather indicates a discussion about the use of forward guidance as a tool. Forward guidance is a communication strategy used by central banks to influence expectations about future monetary policy actions. The mention of discussing near-term monetary policy is procedural and does not hint at whether the policy will be tightened or eased."
2,We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the structure of the U.S. government in comparison to other countries that target inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on how the FOMC might act in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is a neutral observation that does not suggest any particular policy direction."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the U.S. current account deficit and the trade balance, specifically the numerical difference between imports and exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate actions to be taken by the Federal Reserve in terms of tightening or easing. The focus is on the balance of payments rather than on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC when determining monetary policy."
2,"It is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the limitations of macroeconomic policy in generating growth, acknowledging that while it can create favorable conditions, it cannot directly cause growth. This statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a general principle regarding the role of policy in the economy. It suggests a balanced view that recognizes the importance of policy in shaping the economic environment without committing to a specific monetary policy action."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker expects a gradual recovery from the pandemic's economic impact, with growth and a reduction in unemployment anticipated in the latter half of the year. This outlook implies that there may not be an immediate need for tightening monetary policy, as the focus seems to be on supporting the economy's return to full employment and growth, rather than on combating high inflation or overheating. The stance is therefore dovish, as it leans towards a more accommodative policy to aid in the economic recovery."
1,This automatically pushes up domestic interest rates to support the currency.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that domestic interest rates are being increased, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. Raising interest rates is typically done to support a currency and can also be used to combat inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices. This action would be considered hawkish as it indicates a move towards a tighter monetary policy stance."
0,The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where increased productivity and rising corporate profits led to a significant increase in equity prices. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the underlying economic factors that could influence market conditions. The statement is more of an analysis or observation rather than a clear signal of a change in monetary policy stance."
2,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's effort to find a point of balance between supply and demand, which is a conceptual and analytical approach to understanding inflation dynamics. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a neutral stance focused on assessing economic conditions. The mention of seeking a balance suggests a commitment to the dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment without signaling a specific policy action."
2,"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a biographical statement about Palmer's credentials and her view on the inadequacy of using a single unemployment figure for policy program selection. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects a perspective on labor statistics and their use in policy-making, which is related to the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment but does not suggest a specific monetary policy action."
0,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a caution against tightening monetary policy in response to temporary fluctuations in inflation, particularly when policy rates are already near the lower bound. This implies a preference for maintaining or easing the current policy stance rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The dovish stance is further underscored by the concern that responding to temporary inflation with tighter policy could be counterproductive, indicating a priority on avoiding unnecessary constraints on economic activity when inflation is not persistently high."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for certain economic conditions to be met (sustained achievement of employment and inflation objectives) before raising interest rates (""liftoff""), combined with a tool to control interest rates across different maturities (""yield curve caps""). This approach indicates a balanced stance that is neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but rather setting conditions for future actions based on the achievement of the FOMC's goals. It reflects a commitment to the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for immediate policy changes."
2,Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests the use of interest rate caps in combination with forward guidance as a tool to control the yield curve, which implies a strategy to prevent long-term interest rates from rising too quickly. This can be seen as a form of tightening monetary policy because it aims to reinforce the credibility of the central bank's commitment to controlling interest rates, which in turn could help manage inflation expectations. By mentioning the goal of diminishing concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment, it also indicates a desire to limit the expansion of the central bank's balance sheet, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a discussion or consideration of the lag between technology investments and the realization of productivity benefits, which is more related to economic analysis and understanding rather than immediate policy action. It does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future policy moves with respect to interest rates or other monetary tools."
0,"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the U.S. economy, highlighting the loss of lives and the decline in economic activity and employment. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context for the economic challenges faced. The focus is on the state of the economy rather than on specific monetary policy actions to address those conditions."
2,"Besley, Meads and Surico's contribution is to ask whether certain characteristics of the policymakers matter for how they vote on the monetary policy committee.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing research on the characteristics of policymakers and how these might influence their voting behavior on the monetary policy committee. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions or the direction of future policy. It is simply a statement about the nature of research being conducted, which is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the FOMC's inflation target and does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It describes a historical decision regarding the Committee's long-term goals for price stability, which is a key aspect of their mandate, but does not provide information on current or future policy actions."
0,"U.S. monetary policy responded to these global ""headwinds,"" helping stave off actual contractions of U.S. activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. monetary policy was adjusted to counteract negative global economic factors (""headwinds""), with the aim of preventing a contraction in U.S. economic activity. This suggests that the Federal Reserve took action to ease monetary policy in response to external economic challenges, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment, even in the face of potential global slowdowns. This action would be consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if there were concerns that global headwinds could lead to a shortfall in employment or lower inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy."
2,"Median inflation in the nine countries likewise declined, averaging 9-1/2 percent in 1995-99 and 5 percent in 2000-04.Return to text 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical data on inflation rates in nine countries, showing a decline over time. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects past economic conditions, which could be used to inform policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a particular direction for policy."
1,This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities--and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential inflation due to monetary expansion, which may not be controllable through sterilization (i.e., selling securities to offset the monetary expansion). This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The reference to the ""scale of present and expected future debt stocks"" indicates that the ability to use open market operations to manage inflationary pressures could be limited, further suggesting that other forms of tightening might be necessary."
2,"The shift in the stance of monetary policy that we undertook in 2019 was, I believe, well timed and has been providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC's previous action in 2019 to shift its monetary policy stance was aimed at supporting the economy, which suggests that the policy was likely eased to stimulate economic activity. This dovish stance is consistent with efforts to bolster employment and maintain stable prices when the economy might be facing headwinds."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly if there is a risk of inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that focuses on preventing inflation even at the cost of potentially slowing down economic activity. The mention of ""expeditiously remove at least part of that ease"" indicates a bias towards action against inflationary pressures, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the possible interpretations of congressional behavior regarding inflation targeting, suggesting either a lack of support or simply an absence of strong opinions. This does not provide clear guidance on the direction of monetary policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that strong productivity growth allows for higher real interest rates without hampering economic growth. Higher real interest rates typically indicate a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This is because higher interest rates can help to moderate inflation and stabilize prices, which is one of the FOMC's key goals."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that with the economy nearing full employment, there is an increased likelihood of stronger inflation outcomes due to the potential for sustained fiscal stimulus. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other contractionary measures in response to these inflationary pressures, consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while unemployment is very low, which could suggest a tight labor market and potential inflationary pressures, the rise in wages is in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. This balance suggests that the current situation does not necessarily warrant a change in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing, as the conditions are stable and aligned with the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that current financial conditions could negatively impact economic growth, suggesting that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to mitigate these risks and support the economy. This dovish stance aligns with the goal of fostering favorable conditions for maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to forecasting the economy's path towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. It indicates that the forecasts will reflect participants' views on the short-run variability of output and inflation but does not explicitly suggest a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the balancing act between different economic outcomes, which is a core aspect of a neutral policy stance."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate during the 1988-90 period, stating that they were not especially surprising or anomalous. This statement does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reflects a retrospective assessment of economic conditions without suggesting any immediate policy action. It is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a need to adjust monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"The corresponding depreciation in other countries currencies will result in a gradual increase in the foreign currency price of U.S. exports, compared to the prices of foreign produced goods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected outcome of currency depreciation on the price of U.S. exports relative to foreign-produced goods, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It is a statement of fact regarding exchange rate movements and their potential impact on trade, rather than a policy direction. The FOMC might consider such information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for any specific monetary policy action."
1,"During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the inflation rate would be higher than the desired long-term rate, suggesting that there is an upward pressure on inflation. This scenario typically calls for a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the target level, aligning with a hawkish stance. The FOMC would likely consider measures to prevent inflation from rising too far above their target, which could include raising interest rates or other contractionary actions."
0,"While I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to see a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on seeing actual, sustained improvement in inflation before meeting the average inflation goal, which suggests a commitment to not easing monetary policy until inflation trends align more closely with the target. This stance implies a readiness to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to ensure inflation does not run below the desired level, consistent with a hawkish approach to prevent an inflation rate that is too low."
2,The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the central bank's responsibility to ensure low and stable inflation, which typically involves a tighter monetary policy stance to control inflationary pressures. This suggests a commitment to preventing high inflation, which may require raising interest rates or other contractionary measures."
1,"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policy should ""tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential,"" which suggests a readiness to adjust policy proactively to stabilize the economy. The mention of tightening policy implies a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's actions to tighten monetary policy, typically by raising interest rates, have historically led to recessions as a consequence of trying to control inflation. This suggests a stance that prioritizes combating inflation even at the potential cost of economic contraction, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy is a tool used to reduce inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
1,"In the modal outlook, monetary policy tightening to temper demand, in combination with improvements in supply, is expected to reduce demandâ€“supply imbalances and reduce inflation over time.10 The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is engaging in monetary policy tightening, which is a strategy used to reduce demand and address demand-supply imbalances, with the goal of reducing inflation over time. Tightening monetary policy typically involves raising interest rates or taking other actions that would slow economic growth and curb inflationary pressures, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The mention of the real yield curve being in ""solidly positive territory"" suggests that the interest rates are above the inflation rate, further supporting the classification of a hawkish stance."
2,"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes different modeling approaches to economic factors, some of which are directly linked to observable variables like inflation, while others are more abstract statistical representations. It does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather discusses the methodology for understanding economic conditions. This is a technical explanation of economic modeling and does not directly reflect a stance on adjusting monetary policy."
0,"Their trade accounts tend to be in surplus, in some cases substantially, an indication that they are supplying more goods into the global economy than they are demanding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding trade balances and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It simply states a fact about certain economies having trade surpluses, which implies they export more than they import. This information alone does not suggest whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, as it does not directly relate to the domestic goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It also does not provide clear guidance on how the FOMC might adjust the federal funds rate in response to these conditions."
1,"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that emerging markets like Mexico and Brazil have already begun tightening their monetary policy by increasing interest rates in response to expectations of higher inflation. Tightening monetary policy, which often involves raising interest rates, is a measure taken to control inflation and is thus considered a hawkish stance. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the action described is a classic example of a hawkish policy response to inflationary pressures."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to keeping the federal funds rate at a very low level until specific conditions related to employment and inflation are met. This suggests a stance of monetary easing, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a rise in inflation to the 2% target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed this target for some time. This dovish stance is supportive of economic growth and employment, and it shows a tolerance for higher inflation in the short term to achieve these goals."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's future decisions regarding the pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction will be data-dependent, reflecting a stance that is neither explicitly in favor of tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy. It suggests a wait-and-see approach, where actions will be based on the economic indicators relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In recent years, aggressive cost-cutting in the United States has been linked to greater emphasis on maximization of shareholder value and less on growth and diversification, which was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a trend in business practices regarding cost-cutting and corporate focus on shareholder value versus growth and diversification. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic behavior that could influence the FOMC's assessment of the economic landscape but does not suggest a specific monetary policy action."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical market reaction to expectations of the Federal Reserve's tapering (i.e., reducing its asset purchases), which led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility. This reaction then had a significant impact on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), causing sharp declines in their exchange rates and asset prices. The sentence itself does not indicate a current stance of monetary policy but rather discusses the effects of market participants' expectations and subsequent actions. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about the frequency of the Chairman's testimonies before Congress and does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It neither indicates a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy, nor does it offer insight into the Committee's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of globalization on the consensus regarding the importance of price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general belief in the benefits of maintaining stable prices, which aligns with the FOMC's long-term inflation target but does not provide specific guidance on immediate policy actions."
1,"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to adjust policy to control inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing high inflation even if it means potentially slowing down economic activity."
1,"The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary policy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations.1 The global environment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying attention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of strong analytical and empirical foundations to understand the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a future action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather stresses the need for informed decision-making in the context of global economic conditions. The focus on research and understanding suggests a balanced approach to policy formulation, without a clear lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strategy focused on actively reducing inflation, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising in future economic cycles. This approach is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it emphasizes the importance of controlling inflation, even if it might involve measures that could potentially lead to or coincide with a recession. The goal of achieving price stability, even at the cost of short-term economic downturns, aligns with a more aggressive stance on inflation, which is characteristic of hawkish monetary policy."
1,"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a modest increase in inflation, but it also acknowledges that this is from a very low rate, suggesting that the inflation level is not far from the target. The use of ""modest"" and the context of a ""steadily downward-revised"" rate imply that the FOMC does not see an immediate or significant threat to its inflation goals that would warrant a change in policy stance. Therefore, the statement seems to be balanced, neither clearly signaling an intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy."
2,"In addition, at every policy meeting, each member of the MPC is operating with the same information from the staff, and before the quarterly meetings that precede an Inflation Report, the members have sat through a number of discussions covering all aspects of the forecast.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process and the level of information sharing among the members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) before policy meetings, particularly those preceding an Inflation Report. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the thoroughness and consistency of the information that informs their decisions. This process-oriented statement reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not provide insight into the direction of policy adjustments."
2,"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing the Vice Chair's intent to discuss the relationship between financial markets and monetary policy, as well as how he interprets various economic signals. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather focuses on the analytical approach to understanding economic data and its implications for policy. It is a neutral statement as it does not suggest any particular policy action or change in stance."
1,"Stimulus checks put money in people's pockets, and when they spend it, there will be upward pressure on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the distribution of stimulus checks, which increases consumer spending, could lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests a potential need for tightening monetary policy to counteract the inflationary effect and maintain price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,The evidence suggests that new technology often results in more growth in employment in innovating industries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation regarding the impact of new technology on employment growth in innovating industries. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an insight into how technological advancements might influence employment, which is one aspect of the broader economic environment the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
1,"And as reserves reach durably ample levels, we intend to slow the pace of purchases such that our balance sheet grows in line with trend demand for our liabilities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve intends to slow the pace of asset purchases as reserves reach sufficiently high levels. This suggests a move towards tightening monetary policy, as reducing the pace of asset purchases would likely lead to a decrease in the excess liquidity in the financial system, which is consistent with a more hawkish stance. The action aligns with the goal of preventing an overheating economy that could lead to inflation exceeding the FOMC's 2% target."
2,"Furthermore, in the latest report, FOMC participants indicated that the current degree of uncertainty about GDP growth is even higher than the typical level of uncertainty over the past two decades.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' view on the uncertainty surrounding GDP growth, which in itself does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy but rather communicates a state of heightened uncertainty. This uncertainty could lead to either a cautious approach to policy changes or a wait-and-see stance until the economic outlook becomes clearer."
0,"Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been consistently low, even below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and move inflation towards the target level."
1,The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that strong investment is contributing to the growth of productive capacity, which in turn helps to contain inflationary pressures. This implies that the economy is performing well, with sufficient investment to enhance productivity and mitigate inflation without the need for monetary policy intervention to ease conditions. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could be interpreted as a signal that there is less need for a dovish stance (e.g., lowering interest rates or other forms of monetary easing) because inflation is being controlled through economic growth rather than policy measures. It leans toward a hawkish stance as it indicates that the current economic conditions do not warrant additional monetary stimulus."
2,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It merely states a fact about the scarcity of information regarding price and nominal wage expectations from businesses, without suggesting whether this would lead to tighter or looser monetary policy. The focus is on the availability of data that the FOMC might use to inform its decisions, rather than on the decisions themselves."
1,also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, which implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent such an outcome. This stance aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy approach."
2,"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a model used for predicting money growth suggested the possibility of deflation in the years 1991 and 1992 without adjustments. Deflation is a general decline in prices, often associated with a reduction in the supply of money and credit. A dovish stance would be appropriate in the context of deflationary risks, as it implies a preference for monetary easing to counteract deflation and support economic growth. Therefore, the sentence suggests a situation where easing monetary policy might be necessary to prevent deflation and achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while interest rates are low, the cost of servicing debt in relation to homeowners' income remains consistent with historical norms. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation through excessive borrowing costs (which would be hawkish) nor is it too accommodative to the point of potentially creating imbalances (which would be dovish). It reflects a balance between the goals of supporting economic activity and maintaining stable prices, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,"Further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of a ""technological gap"" and its impact on productivity, which is an observation on the state of technology adoption in firms and its effect on the productivity of capital. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more focused on the structural aspects of the economy rather than immediate monetary policy actions. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a change in the current monetary policy stance."
2,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny"" suggests a focus on monitoring inflation trends closely, which could indicate a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation is perceived to be deviating from the target. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the central bank is vigilant about controlling inflation and may adjust policy to prevent it from rising too high, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are anecdotal reports of retailers planning to reduce prices due to excess inventory, there is no aggregate data to confirm a widespread trend of businesses lowering their profit margins due to increased price sensitivity among consumers. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, as it neither clearly indicates a need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects an observation of market conditions without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
2,"Nevertheless, the role of this consideration in inflation dynamics should not be overlooked or underestimated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Nevertheless, the role of this consideration in inflation dynamics should not be overlooked or underestimated."" is neutral because it does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests caution and attention to a particular factor in inflation dynamics but does not imply whether the policy should be tightened or eased. It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and adjusting policy as necessary to maintain stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"In practice, the Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the operational approach of the Federal Reserve, mentioning the use of a committee structure and the consideration of various monetary rules in decision-making. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the process by which decisions are made. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
1,"First, we must be mindful that an unexpected slowdown might occur in the growth of productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses caution regarding potential future economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in productivity growth. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a watchful approach to changing economic indicators. This stance aligns with the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of indicators and adjusting policy as necessary to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,I think it would be naive to assume that circumstances would not arise in which the central bank faced short-term choices between inflation stability and economic or financial stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the central bank recognizes situations where it might have to prioritize inflation stability over economic or financial stability. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to control inflation even if it could have short-term negative impacts on economic or financial stability, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on preventing high inflation."
0,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation regarding stock prices in relation to the economic decline in 1929. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It merely provides a retrospective analysis of market behavior in response to economic conditions, without clear implications for current monetary policy decisions."
2,"As a result, consistent with the policy implication of Bill's 1970 model, the Federal Reserve (like most other central banks) today uses the overnight interbank rate as the principal operating target of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current operational approach of the Federal Reserve, using the overnight interbank rate as the main target for implementing monetary policy. This statement does not indicate whether the Fed is currently inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains a mechanism it uses to achieve its policy goals. It reflects a standard practice rather than a stance on future policy moves."
0,"Although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, it seems natural to expect, as others have argued, that these developments would have exerted some downward pressure on inflation in the United States.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that certain developments are expected to exert downward pressure on inflation in the United States. This implies that inflationary pressures are not a current concern and, therefore, there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. The statement aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth when inflation is not perceived as a threat."
1,"This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took another significant step toward achieving our inflation objective by raising the Federal Funds rate target by 75 basis points.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has decided to raise the Federal Funds rate target by a substantial amount (75 basis points), which is a clear action of tightening monetary policy. This is typically done to combat higher inflation and align with the goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. A rate hike of this magnitude suggests a strong commitment to curbing inflation, which is considered a hawkish move."
2,"At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that future monetary policy decisions will be data-dependent, particularly concerning inflation outlook. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather conveys a wait-and-see approach that will be guided by new economic information. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical approach to setting interest rates, suggesting that they should mimic the behavior they would exhibit under a money supply targeting regime. This statement does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is currently leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general principle or strategy for interest rate policy that could be applied in various economic conditions to achieve the Fed's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide specific information on the direction of policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of central banking, emphasizing the importance of responding to economic shocks to maintain low and stable inflation. It does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather outlines a broad approach to achieving the FOMC's goals. The focus on maintaining credibility by keeping inflation stable is consistent with the FOMC's mandate but does not provide specific guidance on the current policy stance."
2,also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC is taking actions to prevent potential future increases in inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. This preventative approach to inflation is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
2,"The slowing economy, together with rising interest rates, was in turn a major factor in precipitating the stock market crash.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic scenario where a slowing economy and rising interest rates contributed to a stock market crash. It does not directly indicate a future policy stance of tightening or easing by the FOMC. Instead, it provides an observation of past events and their consequences, without suggesting a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments."
0,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to ease monetary policy by using a full range of tools to support the economy in response to increased downward risks to employment and inflation due to the lower bound of interest rates. This suggests a readiness to stimulate economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Here is where unit labor costs, or specifically the relationship between productivity growth and wage increases, would come into play.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between productivity growth and wage increases in the context of unit labor costs, which is a factor that can influence inflation. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely points out an economic consideration that the FOMC might take into account when making policy decisions. The focus on unit labor costs reflects an analysis of economic conditions rather than a clear policy direction."
2,"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a stance on fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, as it refers to changes in the government deficit due to various factors. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. The sentence suggests a passive approach to the natural fluctuations in the deficit, which is a fiscal matter, and does not provide information on the FOMC's actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Therefore, it does not clearly align with hawkish or dovish stances."
1,"Of course, the basic problem in tackling the inflation of the 1970s is that we have one observation and many competing theories.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on the challenges of understanding and addressing inflation in the past, specifically the 1970s. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of economic analysis and the difficulty of drawing conclusions from limited historical data. This statement is more about the challenges of economic interpretation rather than a clear indication of a current monetary policy direction."
2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the compatibility of inflation targeting with different social priorities on inflation and unemployment, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustment. It is a theoretical observation on the flexibility of inflation targeting frameworks rather than a comment on current economic conditions or policy stances."
2,"About two years after the onset of the financial crisis, the ECI moved up slightly in 2010 and then remained essentially flat at an annual growth rate of 2 percent over a five-year period between 2010 and 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical data regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI) and its growth rate over a specific period. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a factual account of past ECI performance, which is a measure of wage inflation, without suggesting any immediate policy implications."
1,"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general characteristic of inflation's response to shocks and the possible ways inflation targeters (like the FOMC) could respond, without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing). It simply outlines that there are multiple ways to react to inflationary shocks, which could be either hawkish or dovish depending on the context and the chosen response."
2,"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply an introductory remark indicating that the speaker will provide a review of the previous year before discussing the outlook and monetary policy challenges for the upcoming year. It does not contain any information on the direction of monetary policy or the Committee's stance on economic conditions."
0,"first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, monetary policy, and credit support initiatives, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an individual's belief that quantifying the price stability objective aligns with the current dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both price stability and maximum employment. However, it also acknowledges the complexity of communicating this change. The statement does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather discusses a matter of policy communication and transparency. It reflects a balanced view without a clear lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"More recently, with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while inflation is under control, there is a concern about ""financial excess,"" which often refers to situations where asset prices are inflated beyond their fundamental values, potentially leading to bubbles or unsustainable financial conditions. A hawkish stance would be concerned with such excesses and might imply a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain financial stability. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, as financial excess can lead to instability and disrupt the achievement of these goals."
1,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" if the unemployment rate declines to the projected 3.8 percent. This suggests that the labor market is approaching a state where additional tightening of monetary policy may be warranted to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, in line with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment. The focus on declining unemployment rates as a sign of reaching maximum employment typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies vigilance against potential inflationary pressures that could arise from a tight labor market."
2,"The result could be cross-border spillovers from the increase in U.S. domestic demand, reducing the effect on U.S. real activity and inflation and potentially contributing to external imbalances.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential outcome of increased U.S. domestic demand leading to cross-border spillovers, which might mitigate the impact on U.S. real activity and inflation and could lead to external imbalances. This statement is more of an observation of economic dynamics rather than a clear indication of a future policy stance. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complex interactions between domestic economic conditions and the global economy."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations to prevent them from causing instability but does not indicate a current direction of monetary policy action (tightening or easing). It emphasizes a general principle of monetary policy rather than a specific policy stance."
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the challenges that technological advancements and financial innovations pose to the traditional understanding and measurement of money, which complicates the implementation of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexities in the monetary policy framework due to structural changes in the financial system. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not suggest any immediate action to adjust monetary policy but highlights the need for ongoing assessment and potential adaptation of policy tools and measures."
2,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of monetary policy as a broad tool that affects the overall economy rather than targeting specific sectors or regions. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the limitations of the policy instrument itself. This statement is more about the characteristics of monetary policy rather than its direction or stance."
0,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is expected to move toward full utilization of its resources without causing an increase in inflation. This suggests that there is room for the economy to grow without the risk of overheating, which could mean that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The use of the word ""gradually"" also indicates a patient approach to policy adjustments, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
2,His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future monetary policy but rather expresses a general economic philosophy regarding market systems and the use of knowledge and information. It does not provide specific guidance on the direction of interest rates, inflation, or employment, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC when determining a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance."
2,"This effort culminated in 1943 with the publication of Banking and Monetary Statistics, which included annual figures on demand and time deposits from 1892 and on currency from 1860.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context about the publication of banking and monetary statistics and does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future policy actions. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather reflects on a past effort to compile economic data."
2,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in using different measures of inflation for policy decisions, highlighting the difference between headline inflation and core inflation, which is typically used in monetary policy. It does not directly suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points out a technical consideration in policy formulation. This reflects a balanced view on how to interpret economic indicators without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a review of monetary policy frameworks by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which is an activity related to assessing and potentially adjusting policy strategies. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to a process of evaluation and correlation between different central banks' policies. This activity is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not in itself suggest a move to either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a regional economic observation regarding unemployment rates and migration patterns within South Dakota, specifically between metropolitan and rural areas. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on employment distribution, which is one of the FOMC's considerations for broader economic assessments. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for any particular monetary policy action."
1,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a preference for responding vigorously to economic disturbances, such as bubbles, even if the response is traumatic, over the long-term negative effects of a high-inflation monetary policy. This implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent high inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability over short-term growth concerns."
2,"There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates, compared to previous expansions","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about an ""unusual discrepancy"" between low unemployment and capacity utilization rates compared to previous economic expansions. This could suggest that the economy is operating beyond its potential, which might lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this observation could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to maintain stable prices, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) assessment of the neutral level of the federal funds rate and its implications for monetary policy. It acknowledges a lower neutral rate compared to historical averages and the potential constraints posed by the effective lower bound (ELB). The statement also recognizes the associated risks to inflation and employment. This analysis is more about the framework and conditions under which the FOMC operates rather than a direct indication of a policy shift towards tightening or easing. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment and the challenges it poses for policy implementation, without committing to a specific policy direction."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to adjust interest rates rapidly in response to changing economic conditions, which implies a proactive stance on monetary policy that could include tightening to counteract inflation or other economic concerns. This readiness to change rates quickly could be seen as hawkish, as it indicates a potential for increasing rates to manage inflation and maintain stable prices, aligning with the FOMC's goals."
2,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of how future wage and price settings incorporate inflation expectations without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather explains a factor that influences economic behavior."
2,"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current monetary policy action is being justified by a forward-looking approach that considers future output gaps and inflation. The Taylor Rule is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, specifically the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation. A forward-looking variant implies that the FOMC is actively considering expected future economic conditions rather than just reacting to current data. If the policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation, it indicates a proactive stance to prevent overheating of the economy or rising inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, hence a hawkish stance."
2,"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a need for alternative measures to gauge inflationary pressures beyond the traditional indicator of excess demand. This indicates a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a readiness to adapt to new information and methods to achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an alignment of the FOMC's policy guidance with its new framework, focusing on the terminology change from ""deviations"" to ""shortfalls"" regarding employment. This change in language does not directly indicate a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance but rather reflects a methodological update in how the FOMC communicates and assesses its employment goals. The emphasis on ""shortfalls"" suggests a tolerance for periods when employment is below its maximum level without immediately implying a policy adjustment, which is a neutral position in terms of immediate policy implications."
0,"Some evidence exists that quantitative easing can stimulate the economy even when interest rates are near zero; see, for example, Christina Romer's (1992) discussion of the effects of increases in the money supply during the Great Depression in the United States.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that quantitative easing (a form of monetary policy where the central bank purchases government securities or other securities from the market to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment) can be effective in stimulating the economy even when traditional policy tools like interest rates are at their lower bound (near zero). This implies a stance that supports the use of expansionary monetary policy to boost economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish approach that favors easing to support growth and employment when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target temporarily. This approach suggests that the FOMC is focused on ensuring that inflation does not fall persistently below its desired level, which could necessitate a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent inflation from becoming too high in the future. By aiming for inflation to be moderately above 2 percent for some time, the FOMC is signaling its commitment to counteract periods of below-target inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
1,But the advent of the war has led to a significant hit to real incomes from large price increases in energy and other commodities in some of the most severely affected economies.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the war has caused a substantial increase in energy and commodity prices, which is likely to lead to higher inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this suggests that there may be a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other measures to reduce inflation and stabilize prices, consistent with the FOMC's mandate for stable prices."
2,"In hindsight, the paths of inflation, real output, stock prices and exchange rates may have seemed preordained, but no such insight existed as we experienced it at the time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on economic conditions without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy. It acknowledges the unpredictability of economic indicators such as inflation and output, but does not suggest any immediate action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on the inherent uncertainty in economic forecasting rather than a commitment to adjust policy in a specific direction."
0,The dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the structural rate of productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth rather than a direct indication of a change in monetary policy. An increase in the structural rate of productivity growth can have various implications for monetary policy. On one hand, it could lead to higher potential GDP growth without increasing inflation, which might not require an immediate policy response. On the other hand, it could also eventually lead to upward pressure on wages and prices, which might warrant a tightening of policy. However, the sentence itself does not specify any particular action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"During the past several years, workers across the wage distribution--not just at the upper end--have seen noticeable increases in the inflation-adjusted value of their wages.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that workers across various wage levels have experienced real wage growth, which could suggest broad-based wage inflation. This scenario might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Real wage increases across the wage distribution can be a sign of a tightening labor market, which often precedes inflationary pressures, prompting a hawkish stance to preempt or counteract rising inflation."
1,"Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve's efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's policy framework in achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability over the past eight years, up until the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of past performance. The mention of the longest economic expansion suggests that the policies were effective in maintaining the dual mandate, but it does not signal a future policy direction."
2,And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation."" is neutral because it does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather comments on the lag effect of monetary policy on inflation. It reflects an understanding of the time it takes for policy adjustments to impact the economy, which is a general principle of monetary policy without a clear hawkish or dovish bias."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing education and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it highlights a nonmonetary factor that can affect economic performance and long-term growth, which is relevant to the FOMC's broader economic goals but does not suggest immediate monetary policy action."
2,"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it suggests a discussion or consideration of factors influencing inflation performance, without a clear implication for immediate policy action. It reflects a balanced view that acknowledges complexities in the economic environment, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to, or even moves above, its long-run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the equilibrium rate, which can be interpreted as the neutral interest rate that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity, might return to or exceed its long-run level because there are fewer downward pressures on aggregate demand. This implies that the economy may be heating up, and therefore, the FOMC might need to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and control inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to reducing monetary accommodation and a decisive response to data with the aim of controlling inflation. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve the FOMC's inflation targets, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a perception issue with the FOMC's critics, rather than indicating a specific policy direction. It highlights the dual mandate of the FOMC to focus on both inflation and employment, but does not provide information on whether the Committee is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about defending the balance in their mandate rather than signaling a change in policy stance."
2,"In 1951, the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord freed the Fed from the obligation to support Treasury bond prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement regarding the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of 1951, which granted the Federal Reserve independence from the Treasury in setting monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on the institutional framework that allows the Fed to pursue its policy goals."
2,"As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal funds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to quarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level.20 In contrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of error.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a rule that guides how the federal funds rate should change based on the gaps between current inflation and the target level, as well as the gap between the current unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level. It does not advocate for a specific direction (tightening or easing) of monetary policy but rather provides a method for adjusting the rate in response to economic indicators. This approach is neutral as it could lead to either an increase or a decrease in the federal funds rate, depending on the economic conditions relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,Another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding non-industrialized nations and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It merely states a fact about the impact of oil prices on current-account balances, which is a separate issue from the Federal Reserve's monetary policy objectives of employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not suggest any specific action or inclination towards changing the monetary policy stance."
1,Theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that an increase in the rate of return on capital, possibly due to a rise in the growth rate of technical change, would necessitate higher real market interest rates. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as higher interest rates are typically used to manage inflation and slow down an overheating economy, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"And, by the end of this year, I support having the policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor, bringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy by suggesting that the policy rate should be set above the neutral level. This action is aimed at reducing demand for products and labor to align it more closely with supply, which is a strategy typically employed to help control inflation. The intent to ""rein in inflation"" by deliberately slowing down the economy is a classic example of a hawkish policy approach, as it prioritizes the goal of stable prices over concerns of potentially dampening employment in the short term."
2,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's dual mandate of aiming for stable prices and maximum employment, stating that there are economic costs associated with deviations from these goals. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of balancing the two objectives. The sentence reflects a general principle of the FOMC's approach to policy-making without suggesting an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of the U.S. higher education system in maintaining economic leadership through scientific and technological innovation and skilled labor preparation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it focuses on the broader economic context and the role of education in economic growth, which is not directly related to the immediate monetary policy actions of the FOMC."
2,"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical context where Regulation Q impacted savings and loans institutions' ability to meet mortgage demands due to interest rate fluctuations. This statement is more of a factual recount of past regulatory conditions rather than an indication of current monetary policy stance. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy in the present context."
0,But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in economic growth, which in itself does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in response. The FOMC might consider various actions in response to slower growth, depending on the context and how this slowdown interacts with their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation on the current economic condition, noting that the impact of rising oil prices on the broader economy has been limited. This suggests that the FOMC may not see an immediate need to adjust policy in response to oil price movements at this time, as the effect on inflation and economic activity is described as modest."
2,"Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the tools and operations the Federal Reserve uses to implement monetary policy, such as outright purchases and sales of assets, repurchase agreements, and discount window loans. It also speculates that these tools could be used in a hypothetical situation where Treasury securities are not available. This statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses the mechanisms of policy implementation. It reflects a neutral stance as it does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy intentions regarding achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In May, there was a notable rebound in employment and decline in unemployment, and these developments are certainly welcome.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reports positive developments in employment without directly suggesting an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges improvements in the labor market, which align with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but does not explicitly indicate whether these improvements will lead to tighter or looser monetary policy. The statement is simply providing an update on economic conditions, which is a neutral action in terms of policy stance."
1,"At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the economy is performing in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The phrase ""trend growth near full employment"" implies that the economy is operating at a level that is close to the FOMC's employment objectives, which does not necessitate an immediate policy change. Therefore, the stance is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's approach to transparency and communication regarding its daily operations and policy decisions, particularly how it manages short-term interest rates. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the method of conveying information to the public and market participants. The focus is on the process of informing and taking responsibility, rather than the direction of policy changes."
2,"Back then, FOMC participants were forecasting unemployment rates around 7-3/4 percent and 7 percent for year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively, in our Summary of Economic Projections; as of the June 2013 round, these forecasts have been revised down roughly 1/2 percentage point each.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical revision of unemployment rate forecasts, indicating an improvement in the labor market outlook. However, it does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reflects an updated economic projection, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy stance. The FOMC may adjust policy based on such forecasts, but the sentence itself does not indicate which direction the policy will take."
2,What implications do these results have for our broader understanding and for the practice of monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflective and inquisitive in nature, asking about the implications of certain results for the understanding and practice of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information about economic conditions such as employment, inflation, or interest rates that would suggest a particular policy direction. Instead, it suggests a consideration of how new information might inform the FOMC's approach to achieving its goals, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, focusing on the dual mandate of controlling inflation and managing unemployment. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to consider both variables in decision-making. This reflects a commitment to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
