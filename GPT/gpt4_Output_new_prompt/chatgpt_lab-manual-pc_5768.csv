2,"Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the average monthly job growth has slowed compared to the previous year, it is still sufficient to accommodate new entrants into the labor force. This suggests a balanced view of the labor market, neither indicating an overheating economy that would require a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish) nor a weak economy that would need stimulus (dovish). It reflects a steady state of employment growth that aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance."
2,That should drive productivity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That should drive productivity."" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a neutral statement that suggests an outcome (increased productivity) without specifying any particular monetary policy action or its implications for employment, inflation, or interest rates. It does not provide enough context to determine whether it is advocating for a hawkish or dovish approach."
1,"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the asset purchases are aimed at stimulating the economy and supporting growth and job creation in the near term, which is a form of monetary easing. The mention of increases in the federal funds rate target as a future action to reduce accommodation does not change the current dovish stance, as it is presented as a subsequent step to the ongoing stimulus efforts. The focus on creating momentum in the economy suggests that the current priority is to support the economy rather than to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,"PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the current increase in headline inflation is viewed as temporary and primarily driven by oil prices, with expectations for inflation to return to the target level of 2 percent. This implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy aggressively if inflation is expected to self-correct without significant intervention."
1,The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economy is moving towards the Federal Reserve's goal of maximum sustainable employment, which is one of the key objectives of the FOMC. However, the statement does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of the current economic situation in relation to the employment goal, without indicating a clear direction for future policy moves."
2,So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical description of how trend inflation is determined and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely explains that there are statistical methods to identify a trend in inflation data, which is a neutral statement regarding policy actions."
2,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the results of econometric models under idealized conditions, showing that optimal policy rules would keep inflation close to the 2% target. This statement does not directly indicate a current or future stance of tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a theoretical outcome under perfect conditions. It reflects the FOMC's long-term inflation goal without suggesting any immediate policy action."
0,"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is willing to keep the target federal funds rate below what is considered normal for a longer period, even after employment and inflation levels approach the Committee's goals. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy, as the Committee is prepared to maintain lower interest rates to support the economic recovery. This dovish stance is aligned with promoting continued growth and employment, even at the risk of allowing inflation to run closer to or slightly above their long-term target."
0,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern about inflation not reaching the target level in a consistent and balanced manner. This suggests that the FOMC may consider easing monetary policy to stimulate inflation towards the 2% target, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to encourage economic activity and price level increases."
2,I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I don’t know that demand for reserves has risen over the past years"" does not provide a clear indication of the direction of monetary policy. It expresses uncertainty about the demand for reserves, which is a factor that can influence monetary policy but does not in itself suggest a tightening or easing stance. The sentence does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a clear policy action or intention."
1,"That’s not going to happen without, without restoring price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to restoring price stability, which suggests that the FOMC may be willing to tighten monetary policy to control inflation and achieve its target rate. This stance is typically associated with actions such as raising interest rates to reduce inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish monetary policy approach."
1,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that high inflation could be more persistent, which implies a risk of inflation running above the FOMC's target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in December and January, we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy, particularly if inflation is running below the FOMC's 2 percent target. This suggests that the Committee would be inclined to take measures to stimulate the economy and increase inflation towards the desired level, rather than tightening policy."
2,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite low unemployment leading to higher wages, companies are not passing these costs on to consumers through higher prices, which implies that inflationary pressures are not intensifying. This could indicate that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports accommodative policy measures to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical policy decision without indicating a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that the Committee, after a period of study, decided to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime earlier in the year. This does not provide information on the current direction of policy adjustments in relation to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong labor market characterized by high participation, low unemployment, high employment, and rising wages across the spectrum. This scenario suggests that the economy is heating up, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is inclined to keep the current target range for the federal funds rate for a significant period after the end of the asset purchase program, particularly if inflation continues to run below the 2 percent target. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy, as the Committee is signaling its readiness to maintain lower interest rates to support economic activity and boost inflation towards its desired level. The reference to a ""considerable time"" and the condition of inflation remaining below the target both point to a dovish approach, aimed at fostering conditions that support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
1,"And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an intention to tighten monetary policy by gradually increasing interest rates over the year, assuming the economy progresses as expected and risks remain balanced. This approach aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, suggesting that they may be anticipating or responding to inflationary pressures by removing some of the monetary accommodation. The use of ""several interest rate increases"" implies a clear direction towards a tighter monetary policy stance."
2,There was a lot of pent-up demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""There was a lot of pent-up demand"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an economic observation that could potentially lead to various policy responses depending on the context. If pent-up demand leads to higher inflation, it might warrant a hawkish response, but the sentence alone does not provide enough information about the FOMC's policy direction."
1,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a moderation in household spending, the overall economic fundamentals remain strong due to a healthy job market, rising incomes, and high consumer confidence. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, neither clearly signaling the need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy, but rather suggesting stability in the factors that influence consumer spending."
1,"To the extent the global economy is weak and the United States is strong, it’ll—we’ll wind up, you know, we’ll wind up exporting some of our demand through, through imports rather than having, having a lot of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the U.S. economy is performing strongly relative to a weak global economy, leading to an increase in imports due to robust domestic demand. This statement does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions, particularly the balance of trade, which could have various implications for monetary policy depending on other contextual factors. The FOMC might consider such conditions when making decisions, but this sentence alone does not suggest a specific policy action."
0,"Well, you know, if the economy were disappointing, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflation, we would also take employment into account.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC would consider a more accommodative monetary policy stance (i.e., not just tightening due to inflation) if the economy underperforms, taking into account the goal of maximum employment. This suggests a willingness to ease policy in response to weak economic conditions, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC takes into consideration risks to the financial system that could impede achieving its goals, but it does not specify any particular action or direction of policy (tightening or easing). It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring risks and adjusting policy as necessary to maintain its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic issue that is acknowledged as serious but also states that its underlying causes are not related to monetary policy or the response to the pandemic. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a role for monetary policy to address this particular problem directly, indicating a stance that is neither explicitly advocating for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The focus is on the nature of the problem rather than on a policy response, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commentary on past criticism and does not directly indicate a current policy stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the historical context of inflation targeting and the variability of economic predictions, but does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions."
0,"We’re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are no significant labor market pressures that could lead to a rapid increase in inflation, and it also notes that inflation is currently below the FOMC's objective. This suggests that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy, as the conditions described are more consistent with a need to stimulate the economy or maintain an accommodative stance to reach the inflation target and support employment."
2,I would further say that I think it’s important to emphasize that we’re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants provide and just build policy off of that.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) does not intend to strictly follow the interest rate projections provided by its participants when making policy decisions. This suggests a flexible approach to monetary policy, which does not inherently signal a clear move towards tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced stance, emphasizing the use of a range of indicators and judgments rather than relying solely on preset projections."
1,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to maintaining price stability, which is often associated with preventing high inflation. The mention of having ""both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time"" suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to control inflation. This stance is typically considered hawkish, as it emphasizes the priority of controlling inflation, which could involve increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy."
1,"Business and household spending are increasing at rates consistent with moderate economic growth, though household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that spending by businesses and households is aligned with moderate economic growth, which suggests that the economy is growing at a stable pace. The mention of household spending rising at a somewhat slower pace does not necessarily signal a need for a change in monetary policy, as it does not directly indicate a significant deviation from the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The overall tone is balanced, without a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a projection of the unemployment rate declining over the next few years, which is a positive outlook for the labor market. However, it does not directly indicate a specific action or stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. It simply states the Committee's expectations for the unemployment rate, which is one of the indicators they monitor. The projection itself could be consistent with either a hawkish or dovish stance depending on the context of inflation and other economic conditions, but in isolation, it is neutral."
1,"We have Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service that debt, an improving job market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic condition, with households managing their debt better and an improving job market, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects an observation of the current economic situation rather than a commitment to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on a past decision not to implement negative interest rates during the financial crisis. It does not indicate a current policy stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it simply states a historical fact about the FOMC's actions without suggesting any current or future direction."
1,So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices"" does not directly indicate a clear stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the impact of higher gasoline prices, which could be inflationary, but without additional context, it does not suggest a specific policy action or change. The sentence could be part of a broader discussion on inflationary pressures, but on its own, it does not provide enough information to classify it as hawkish or dovish."
0,"Inflation is also being held down, reflecting weaker demand as well as significantly lower energy prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is being kept low due to reduced demand and lower energy prices. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, as the current economic conditions are contributing to keeping inflation in check. Lower inflation, particularly when associated with weaker demand, may lead the FOMC to adopt a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and move closer to its employment and inflation objectives."
2,It’s where we always want inflation to be heading.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It’s where we always want inflation to be heading"" does not provide specific information about the current or future stance of monetary policy. It simply expresses a general desire for inflation to move towards a target, which is consistent with the FOMC's long-term goal of a 2% inflation rate. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC believes it needs to tighten or ease monetary policy to achieve this goal, nor does it provide insight into the current state of inflation relative to this target. Therefore, it is considered neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"I’m just saying, that, that is what fiscal policy can do that, really, monetary policy can’t do—is, is invest in the future productive capacity of the economy, raise potential growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in investing in the future productive capacity of the economy and raising potential growth, rather than directly commenting on the current or future stance of monetary policy. It contrasts the capabilities of fiscal policy with those of monetary policy, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Therefore, it does not provide information on the FOMC's stance towards its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about productivity and economic growth without directly indicating a future course of action regarding monetary policy. It acknowledges a discrepancy between expectations and actual economic performance, but does not suggest whether the FOMC will respond by tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on explaining past developments rather than signaling future policy moves."
0,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current state of the housing sector and attributes part of its recovery to low mortgage interest rates. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation of the economic conditions related to the housing market. The mention of low mortgage interest rates suggests a supportive environment for the housing sector, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of fostering economic conditions that support the broader economy. However, without additional context on the Committee's future policy intentions, the stance remains neutral."
2,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a hope for stabilization and growth in Europe, which is more of a commentary on external economic conditions rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's own monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action or change in policy, such as tightening or easing, by the Federal Reserve itself. The focus is on the actions of Europe rather than the domestic policy, making it a neutral statement in terms of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a preference for gradually tightening monetary policy by removing accommodation, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. The reference to a tight labor market with various indicators, such as low unemployment and difficulty in hiring, suggests that the economy is strong enough to handle less accommodative measures without jeopardizing the FOMC's employment goals. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach to prevent potential inflationary pressures that could arise from a tight labor market."
0,"I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current unemployment rate is below what the FOMC considers consistent with maximum employment, which could indicate a tight labor market. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to inflationary pressures as a tight labor market often leads to wage growth, which can feed into higher inflation. Therefore, the statement may imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an outbreak on economic activity and financial markets without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges external economic disturbances but does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing measures. The focus is on the observation of conditions rather than a policy stance."
1,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a recognition of economic progress and an approach to a sustainable unemployment rate, which suggests a balanced view on the current economic situation. It does not explicitly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather an acknowledgment of moving towards the FOMC's employment goals. The statement is neutral as it does not provide information on the direction of future policy actions but rather assesses the current state of one aspect of the dual mandate (employment)."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that falling oil prices are contributing to lower inflation. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment, as there is less need to counteract high inflation with tightening measures."
0,"And if the stock theory of the portfolio is correct, which we believe it is, holding all of those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the, you know, rolling-over maturing securities, will still continue to put downward pressure on interest rates.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Federal Reserve's actions of holding securities and reinvesting in them, as well as rolling over maturing securities, are intended to maintain downward pressure on interest rates. Lower interest rates are typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as this approach aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, which can support employment and growth when the economy is not overheating. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if the economy is showing signs of weakness or if inflation is below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering international developments and the growth prospects of trade partners as part of their economic forecasting. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where external factors are taken into account but do not necessarily imply an immediate shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's commitment to being informed by a range of indicators and balancing risks without indicating a clear direction towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"These headwinds—which include developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various economic challenges that could have an impact on the U.S. economy, but it does not directly suggest an immediate action in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges potential obstacles to economic growth without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The mention of ""headwinds"" suggests caution and a focus on monitoring these issues, but it does not commit to a specific policy stance."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes maintaining low interest rates is suitable for the current economic conditions. This implies a preference for an easier monetary policy stance to support economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish approach that typically favors lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing, investment, and growth, especially when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the complexity of economic forecasting and acknowledges that tax policy changes are just one of many factors influencing growth and inflation projections. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where the FOMC considers a wide range of data and factors before making decisions."
1,And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there"" suggests that inflationary pressures may be increasing as prices rise from their previous low levels. This could indicate a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too quickly, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. If prices are moving up, the FOMC might consider measures to cool down the economy, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that even when traditional monetary policy tools, like adjusting short-term interest rates, are no longer available (e.g., when rates hit the zero lower bound), the central bank still has other measures it can take to provide economic stimulus. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further if necessary, which aligns with a dovish stance."
1,"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising inflation rates, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. The mention of inflation moving above the 2 percent target is a signal that the Committee may need to act to prevent inflation from rising too high, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects a slow economic recovery and a gradual decrease in unemployment, which suggests that the Committee might maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy and speed up the recovery process. This dovish stance aligns with the goal of promoting maximum employment, one of the key objectives of the FOMC."
2,"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to balance the two parts of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. It does not lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes an evenhanded approach to both goals."
0,"We have a 2 percent symmetric inflation objective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been consistently below the FOMC's target of 2 percent for several years. This suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to raise inflation towards the target level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. A dovish stance typically involves keeping interest rates low to stimulate economic activity and increase inflation to the desired level."
2,"And—and we do that with measures that—that, you know, keep people in their homes; that—that support hiring; that support growth; that avoid unnecessary, avoidable business insolvencies.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on supporting economic activity through measures that prevent foreclosures, encourage hiring, stimulate growth, and prevent avoidable business failures. This suggests an easing of monetary policy to maintain or stimulate economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance. The FOMC's dovish actions typically aim to boost the economy when there is a risk of falling short of their employment and inflation objectives."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an acceptance of inflation running moderately above the 2 percent target, which suggests that the speaker is not inclined to recommend immediate tightening measures to bring inflation down to the target level. However, the tolerance for higher inflation is often seen as a precursor to future tightening if inflation persists, as the FOMC would likely take action to prevent inflation from rising too far above the target. This forward-looking stance implies a readiness to tighten policy if necessary to maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the trimmed mean measures of inflation did not decrease significantly, but it does not explicitly suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states an observation about inflation measures, without indicating whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The statement is factual and does not imply immediate action, thus it is classified as neutral in terms of policy stance."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering reviewing and potentially innovating its framework to better achieve its symmetric 2 percent inflation goal over time. This suggests a balanced approach to policy, focusing on adjustments that could either tighten or ease policy depending on the specific changes made to support the inflation target. It does not directly indicate an immediate move towards tightening or easing policy, but rather a willingness to adapt strategies to maintain their long-term objectives."
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests satisfaction with the current policy framework and does not hint at any imminent policy changes."
2,"We have a three-part baseline projection, which involves increasing growth that’s picking up over time as fiscal drag is reduced, continuing gains in the labor market, and inflation moving back towards objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a baseline projection that includes positive economic growth, improvements in the labor market, and inflation moving towards the FOMC's objective. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, with no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The statement reflects an expectation that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goals without specifying any immediate policy actions."
1,"The central tendency rises to 2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the longer-run growth rate.","HAWKISH
