2,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will make decisions on the timing and size of adjustments to the federal funds rate based on how actual and expected economic conditions compare to its goals of maximum employment and a symmetric 2 percent inflation target. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather communicates a balanced approach that will depend on future economic data. It reflects a commitment to adjusting policy as needed to achieve its dual mandate, without a current bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Consumer prices jumped in October, as hurricane damage contributed to higher prices for food and energy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that consumer prices have increased, specifically mentioning higher prices for food and energy due to hurricane damage. This suggests inflationary pressures, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Specifically, the projections converged on CPI inflation rates of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent in 1997 and 2-1/2 to 3 percent in 1998.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides projections for CPI inflation rates that are close to the FOMC's target of a 2% inflation rate over the long term. The projections indicate a slight overshoot of the target but do not in themselves suggest an immediate policy action. The statement is simply reporting expected inflation rates without indicating whether the FOMC will respond with tightening or easing measures. It reflects a balanced view that acknowledges expected deviations in inflation while not clearly signaling a change in policy stance."
0,"The steepening of the yield curve was due mostly to sharply lower short- and intermediate-term forward rates, consistent with investors' apparently more pessimistic outlook for economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that investors are expecting slower economic growth, as evidenced by the decline in short- and intermediate-term forward rates, which has led to a steepening of the yield curve. This pessimistic outlook could suggest that there is less pressure on inflation and that the economy might need support, which aligns with a dovish stance where the central bank might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is planning to adjust policy in a way that is consistent with its long-term objectives of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. The use of ""balanced approach"" suggests that the Committee is neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) but is aiming to strike a balance between the two to achieve its goals. This implies a careful and measured response to economic conditions without a clear indication of moving in a more restrictive or accommodative direction."
0,"Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that several members of the FOMC are concerned about potential negative risks to economic activity and inflation, which suggests a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy. This concern for downside risks implies a readiness to maintain or ease policy to support the economy and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term target, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the market's reaction to the FOMC's communications, stating that there was little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. This indicates that the communications were likely perceived as consistent with existing expectations and did not signal a clear shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced or status quo situation rather than a change in policy stance."
0,"Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests concern about the risk of disinflation, which is a reduction in the rate of inflation, due to a significant amount of unused resources and potential adverse developments that could hinder economic growth. This implies that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract these disinflationary pressures and support economic expansion, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate the economy."
1,"At the same time, however, the staff increased the growth rate forecast for 2006 to reflect the boost to economic activity from the rebuilding effort.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an adjustment in the economic growth forecast due to increased activity from rebuilding efforts, which is a response to a specific economic event rather than a direct indication of a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather is acknowledging an external factor that is affecting economic growth. The statement is simply providing information on economic conditions without a clear direction on policy adjustments."
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment levels are holding steady and labor markets remain tight, which is generally a sign of a healthy economy, but it also notes signs of softening, which could suggest potential future weakness. This balance between positive and negative signals does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, hence the classification as neutral. The FOMC might interpret this as a situation where the current policy stance is appropriate while they continue to monitor incoming data."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tightening of monetary policy through the use of the term ""firming of the stance of monetary policy."" This suggests that the FOMC is considering or has decided to take actions to reduce inflationary pressures and bring inflation down to its 2 percent longer-run goal, which aligns with a hawkish stance that typically involves increasing interest rates or taking other measures to constrain the economy and prevent overheating."
2,Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced"" suggests that the FOMC members do not see a clear bias toward either higher or lower inflation than their target. This indicates that they do not currently see a need to adjust monetary policy significantly in either direction to achieve their inflation goal, reflecting a neutral stance on monetary policy."
0,"Subsequently, the expected future path of monetary policy dropped amid increasing concerns about the health of financial institutions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the expected future path of monetary policy has become more accommodative due to increasing concerns about the health of financial institutions. This suggests a potential easing of monetary policy to support the financial sector, which aligns with a dovish stance. The FOMC may be signaling readiness to lower interest rates or implement measures to ensure liquidity and stability in the financial system, which would be in line with efforts to prevent negative impacts on employment and to maintain stable prices during times of financial stress."
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the external sector will have a minor negative impact on economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of one of the many factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly indicate that the FOMC will adjust its policy in response to this influence, thus it is best classified as neutral."
2,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on the disparate forces that continued to shape trends in economic activity, notably the persist- ence of considerable strength in private domestic spending and the damping influences stemming from foreign economic developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's discussion of economic conditions, highlighting both strong domestic spending and negative influences from abroad. It does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the mixed economic factors at play. This balanced view suggests a neutral stance, as the Committee is weighing different aspects of the economy without a clear bias towards action."
0,"Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee expects that the combination of policy actions aimed at stabilizing financial markets and institutions, along with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will help the economy recover gradually. The mention of ""monetary stimulus"" implies that the Committee is inclined towards easing monetary policy to support economic growth, which aligns with a dovish stance. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, especially when the near-term economic outlook is weak, indicating a focus on stimulating the economy rather than containing inflation or tightening monetary conditions."
1,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting, real GDP growth in the second half of this year was expected to step up from its pace in the first half.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of increased real GDP growth in the second half of the year compared to the first half, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It simply provides an economic forecast, which could be used to inform policy decisions, but does not in itself indicate whether the FOMC will adopt a more hawkish or dovish stance. The statement is factual and does not convey any direct action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic data regarding net exports and their impact on real GDP growth, without directly suggesting a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It indicates an improvement in the trade balance component of GDP but does not explicitly relate this to the FOMC's stance on monetary policy adjustments. The sentence merely provides an economic update, which could be used to inform policy decisions, but does not in itself advocate for a particular policy direction."
1,"However, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC members on the need for a slight tightening of monetary policy. This action is aimed at containing inflation and preventing imbalances that could harm the economy's performance. The reference to ""tightening resource constraints"" and ""unsustainable growth"" suggests concerns about overheating, which typically leads to a hawkish stance to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. The decision to tighten policy is a proactive measure to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"However, in the view of most members, the outlook for both economic activity and price pressures remained very uncertain, and thus the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was quite unclear.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are uncertain about the economic outlook and price pressures, which suggests they are not signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of uncertainty regarding the timing and magnitude of future policy actions reflects a balanced or wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance. They are neither committing to a hawkish path of increasing rates to combat inflation nor a dovish path of lowering rates to stimulate the economy. Instead, they are acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the economic environment and the need to remain flexible in their policy decisions."
0,U. S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""U.S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year"" is a statement of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a context in which the FOMC might consider its policy options to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The sentence reflects the challenges faced by the economy, which could lead to either a dovish or hawkish response depending on the broader economic context and the FOMC's assessment of the appropriate policy response to achieve its objectives."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This communication strategy is aimed at influencing the pricing of longer-term interest rates to align with the monetary policy path they deem most likely. Keeping interest rates low is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it indicates a policy geared towards stimulating economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, with the intention of supporting employment and avoiding deflationary pressures. This approach is consistent with a dovish policy when the Committee is more focused on stimulating the economy rather than on concerns about inflation."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of factors that could contribute to faster real GDP growth, such as easing fiscal policy, rising confidence, better credit availability, improved financial conditions, and stronger foreign economic growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of various economic conditions and influences that could impact growth. The FOMC might consider these factors when making future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
2,Major equity indexes appeared to be supported by lower interest rates and posted modest gains despite the increases in energy prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where equity markets are responding positively to lower interest rates, which could be a result of either a dovish or a neutral policy stance. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. The mention of ""modest gains"" in equity indexes despite rising energy prices suggests a balanced view of the economic situation, without a clear lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' view that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite recent global economic and financial developments. This statement does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of the current economic conditions, suggesting that the economy is growing at a steady rate without signaling any immediate concerns that would prompt a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects a balanced view that is neither particularly optimistic (which might suggest a hawkish stance) nor pessimistic (which might suggest a dovish stance)."
2,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's or public's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook for inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a situation where the FOMC might maintain its current policy stance, as long-term inflation expectations aligning with their target would not necessarily prompt a policy adjustment."
1,They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite the additional tightening (firming) of monetary policy, there is still a predominant risk of increasing inflationary pressures. This suggests that the FOMC may continue to tighten monetary policy to counteract inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The focus on combating rising inflation is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the use of the term ""additional firming"" implies that the Committee is already in the process of tightening monetary policy."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, specifically the performance of equity prices over a period. This statement does not explicitly suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC would consider this market condition as a signal to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
1,"In his view, historical precedents suggested that prolonged periods of taut labor markets were eventually associated with rising inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that sustained tight labor markets could lead to increased inflation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent such inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish viewpoint. Tightening policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the labor market and prevent overheating, which could drive inflation above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%."
0,"Long-term government bond yields declined and headline equity indexes increased, on net, in most of these countries, with bank stock prices in the euro area rising more than broader indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding bond yields and equity indexes, specifically mentioning the performance of bank stock prices in the euro area. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance or signal the FOMC's intentions to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a context of the financial environment, which is part of the broader economic indicators the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any particular action in response to these market movements."
1,"Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is strengthening, with solid job gains and a decreasing unemployment rate, suggesting a reduction in the underutilization of labor resources. This improvement in labor market conditions could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation, which might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The focus on diminishing underutilization aligns with the goal of maximum employment, but in the context of the FOMC's dual mandate, it could also signal a need to adjust policy to prevent inflation from rising above the targeted level."
0,"Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations along with the risks to the U. S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow U. S. economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for easing monetary policy by suggesting a policy rate reduction. This action is justified by persistent low inflation readings and subdued inflation expectations, which are below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. Additionally, the mention of providing insurance against potential slowdowns in U.S. economic growth further supports a dovish stance, as it implies a readiness to stimulate the economy in the face of potential risks. The dovish stance is aimed at boosting inflation to the target level and safeguarding against negative economic developments."
2,The staff's forecast for inflation was basically unchanged from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's inflation forecast has not changed since the previous FOMC meeting, suggesting that there has been no significant new information to warrant a change in the monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy, but rather a continuation of the current approach, reflecting a balanced or steady view on inflation."
0,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that financial conditions are supportive of growth in economic activity and employment, with a slightly lower expected path for the federal funds rate, modest decreases in longer-term Treasury yields, rising equity prices, narrowing corporate bond spreads, and a stable dollar. These conditions suggest an easing of monetary policy, as they are conducive to economic expansion without the need for tightening. The lower expected path of the federal funds rate implies that the FOMC may be leaning towards a more accommodative stance to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy."
0,"In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically within the household sector, noting that mortgage debt has increased at a slow pace due to decelerating house prices. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on current economic trends. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring various economic indicators, which could influence future policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest an immediate policy stance."
1,"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where inflation expectations, as measured by the market for TIPS, have increased slightly but are still aligned with levels seen before the pandemic. This observation does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, as it indicates neither a significant increase in inflation expectations that would warrant a tightening (hawkish stance) nor a decrease that might suggest the need for easing (dovish stance). It reflects a market assessment that is consistent with the FOMC's long-term inflation target and suggests a balanced view on inflation risks."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. This sentence does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects the market's interpretation of external communications and data. It suggests a change in investor expectations but does not clarify whether the expected policy path adjustment was towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, without explicit information on the direction of the policy shift, the sentence is best classified as neutral."
1,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee views the economy as strong and resilient, even in the face of adverse events such as high energy prices and natural disasters. This implies that the economy is growing solidly, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In this context, a solid expansion in economic activity might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net"" indicates a slight decrease in the market's long-term inflation expectations, as measured by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). This observation is neutral because it does not strongly suggest a need for immediate monetary policy action. A slight decrease in inflation expectations could be consistent with inflation moving towards the FOMC's target, which would not necessarily warrant a clear shift towards more hawkish or dovish policy. It reflects an assessment of future conditions rather than a current policy stance or immediate policy implications."
2,"Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members' forecasts for consumer price inflation are centered well below the Committee's long-term target of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is not seen as a current threat and that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so to support economic activity and help drive inflation towards the target level. There is no indication of a need to tighten policy to combat high inflation, which would be a hawkish stance."
2,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that one member of the FOMC does not believe that the economic conditions (specifically, economic growth and unemployment) warrant further policy accommodation, which typically means lowering interest rates or other easing measures. This stance suggests a leaning against further easing, implying a preference for maintaining or tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability and manage inflation, consistent with a hawkish viewpoint."
0,"Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are signs of weakening in the labor market, as evidenced by layoffs in financial services, a softer demand for temporary workers, and an expected continuation of weakness in construction employment. These developments suggest that the economy might be slowing down, which could lead to less pressure on inflation and therefore might warrant an easing of monetary policy to support employment. This aligns with the dovish stance of promoting economic growth and employment when there is no significant inflationary pressure."
0,"While the underlying demand for residential housing continued to be robust and government outlays evidently were rising, the expansion of consumer spending seemed to have slowed, and outlays for capital spending were still very sluggish in an environment of business uncertainty and pessimism.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation with robust demand in one sector (residential housing), an increase in government spending, but also a slowdown in consumer spending and sluggish capital spending due to business uncertainty and pessimism. This combination of both positive and negative economic indicators does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a balanced view that could be consistent with a neutral policy stance. The FOMC might interpret these conditions as reasons to maintain the current policy until clearer trends emerge."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the challenges in predicting economic outcomes. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (suggesting tightening) nor dovish (suggesting easing)."
1,"Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a preference for preemptive tightening of monetary policy to sustain economic growth before any actual increase in inflation occurs. This suggests a willingness to raise interest rates or take other contractionary actions to prevent inflation from rising, even before it becomes a visible problem, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes inflation control over stimulating economic growth."
2,"Employment had risen a little, but not enough to lower the unemployment rate, and labor productivity seemed to be trending sharply upward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a mixed economic situation where employment has increased slightly, but not sufficiently to reduce the unemployment rate, while labor productivity is on a sharp upward trend. This suggests that there are both positive and negative aspects to the current economic conditions. The increase in labor productivity could be seen as a positive factor that might lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflationary pressure. However, the fact that the unemployment rate has not decreased could be a concern for the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. Since the sentence does not clearly lean towards a need for tightening or easing monetary policy, it is best classified as neutral."
2,"Share prices of financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in part, of concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions to economic conditions, specifically regarding the financial sector's stock prices due to concerns about subprime mortgage exposures and potential slowdowns in merger activity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather provides context on economic factors that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process."
1,"The large current account deficit was seen as a factor pointing to potential depreciation of the dollar over time, with adverse repercussions on domestic inflation albeit favorable effects on exports.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential inflationary pressures arising from a depreciating dollar due to a large current account deficit. This concern for rising inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent or counteract these pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, which would be consistent with a hawkish approach to achieving the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is expected to support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC is maintaining an easing policy to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance. The use of ""accommodative"" specifically refers to policies that are designed to encourage economic growth, typically through lower interest rates or other supportive measures. The expectation that this will lead to a recovery without immediate tightening implies a preference for continued support to the economy, rather than concern over inflation that would warrant a hawkish stance."
1,"Participants thought that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and real income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of steady economic growth, with consumer spending expected to increase moderately due to improvements in employment and real income. This outlook suggests a balanced view of the economy, neither indicating a need to tighten monetary policy to cool down an overheating economy (hawkish) nor suggesting a need to stimulate the economy due to weakness (dovish). It reflects a belief that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without the immediate need for a change in monetary policy stance."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about core inflation being ""uncomfortably high,"" which suggests they believe inflation is above the target level. The emphasis on the ""importance of further moderation"" implies that they would support measures to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation down, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes combating inflation even if it could potentially slow down economic growth or increase unemployment in the short term."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which would prompt a hawkish stance to prevent or curb such an increase."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where economic activity is picking up after a previous slowdown, which is a neutral observation and does not directly indicate a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a change in economic conditions without suggesting a specific monetary policy response. The FOMC might consider this information in the context of their broader goals, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy stance."
0,"Economic data releases were mixed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but market participants were especially attentive to incoming information on the labor market--most notably, the private payroll figures in the employment report for May, which were considerably weaker than investors expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the reaction of market participants to economic data, particularly focusing on labor market information that was weaker than expected. It does not directly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Committee's role in monitoring economic indicators to inform their policy decisions. The mention of weaker-than-expected employment data could be a concern for the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but without additional context on the FOMC's interpretation or intended response, the stance remains neutral."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent need to adjust the federal funds rate due to ""muted inflation pressures"" and ""uncertainties."" The use of the word ""patient"" suggests that they are in no rush to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment, especially when inflation is not a pressing concern."
1,"Nonetheless, the reported rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months could presage a broader increase in job growth and thus was a welcome development.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on employment trends, suggesting that an increase in temporary workers might lead to broader job growth. This observation is a factual statement about labor market conditions rather than a clear indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment that could be used to inform future policy decisions based on how it aligns with the FOMC's employment goals."
2,Surveys indicated that households’ expectations of inflation over the next year were little changed in February while households’ and professional forecasters’ longer-term inflation expectations edged lower.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is no significant change in the short-term inflation expectations of households and a slight decrease in the longer-term inflation expectations of both households and professional forecasters. This suggests that there is no immediate pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone. The FOMC might view this as a sign that current policy is broadly aligned with its inflation objectives, hence the classification as neutral."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expansion in monetary aggregates due to increased demand for currency and inflows to retail money market funds, which is happening during a period of weakness in the U.S. bond and equity markets. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's monitoring of various economic indicators, which is consistent with their goal of maintaining transparency and balancing risks while pursuing their long-term objectives. The expansion of monetary aggregates could be a result of the FOMC's previous policy actions or market-driven demand for liquidity, but the sentence itself does not specify a policy stance."
2,"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt over a specified period, which indicates a continuation of the existing policy rather than a shift towards tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced approach that neither explicitly aims to cool down nor stimulate the economy, but rather to sustain the current monetary conditions."
2,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are aware of the market's focus on policy communications and stress the importance of reinforcing the Committee's consistent reaction function and commitment to its monetary policy framework. This does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes transparency and consistency in the Committee's approach. It reflects a balanced stance, maintaining the status quo in terms of policy communication without signaling a shift towards more hawkish or dovish actions."
2,” The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the statement to be released shortly after the meeting: “The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters to be roughly equal.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the risks to both growth and price stability as balanced for the upcoming quarters. This suggests that they do not currently see a need to adjust monetary policy in a more restrictive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) direction, as they perceive the risks to their dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices to be evenly balanced."
2,"With the restraint from fiscal policy assumed to increase next year, the staff projected that increases in real GDP would not significantly exceed the growth rate of potential output in 2013.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation that real GDP growth will align with the potential output growth rate, suggesting a balanced view of economic conditions without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an anticipation of fiscal policy providing restraint, which is a factor outside of the direct influence of monetary policy, and does not in itself suggest a change in the stance of monetary policy."
0,"First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an adjustment in the economic outlook, specifically regarding productivity gains and potential output growth, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The trimming of projections could be due to various factors and does not inherently signal a change in policy stance. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions, which is a necessary input for policy decisions, but without additional context on how this will influence the FOMC's actions regarding interest rates or other monetary tools, the stance remains unclear."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad goals that guide the Committee's actions."
0,"On balance over the intermeeting period, interest rates on private instruments registered small mixed changes while yields on longer-term Treasury securities declined significantly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observed changes in interest rates and yields without explicitly indicating a future policy action or a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy. The mixed changes in interest rates on private instruments and the decline in yields on longer-term Treasury securities could be the result of various factors, including market expectations and economic data, rather than a direct result of FOMC policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past event regarding inventory investment's contribution to economic output and anticipates a change in inventory accumulation that is expected to affect future economic growth. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. The focus on inventory levels and their impact on economic growth is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the impact of policy measures on unemployment statistics without directly suggesting a future course of action for monetary policy. It indicates that emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have influenced labor force participation and unemployment rates, but it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on understanding the labor market dynamics rather than signaling a change in monetary policy stance."
2,"The household saving rate, which had already risen considerably, would eventually level out and cease to hold back consumption growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the household saving rate will stabilize, which is a neutral observation regarding future consumption growth. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of one economic indicator that could influence future policy decisions. The stabilization of the saving rate implies that consumption might increase without additional stimulus, aligning with the FOMC's goal of fostering economic conditions that support consumption and growth. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the increase in inflation is expected to be temporary and is associated with slack in labor and product markets, as well as stable long-term inflation expectations. This implies that there is no immediate concern for persistent inflation that would require tightening of monetary policy. The mention of inflation being transitory if commodity prices do not rise significantly further indicates a wait-and-see approach, which is more aligned with a dovish stance that supports easing rather than tightening."
0,"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation by the FOMC members about consumer spending patterns, suggesting that they do not anticipate a surge in consumer spending typically seen in recovery periods because spending remained strong even during the downturn. This implies that there is no significant pent-up demand to drive future inflation higher, which could necessitate a tightening of policy. However, it also does not suggest an immediate need for easing policy, as it does not point to economic weakness. Therefore, the stance is balanced and does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In contrast, economic activity declined in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic performance in Japan, noting a decline in economic activity during the third quarter following a period of growth in the first half of the year. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments, such as changes to the federal funds rate, nor does it provide clear implications for the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States. It is simply a neutral observation of economic conditions abroad."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides information that could be used to assess the state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. The improvement in these metrics could be seen as a sign of a strengthening labor market, which the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not convey a clear policy stance."
2,"In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not see strong evidence of either increasing or decreasing inflation or inflation expectations, suggesting that they do not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The mention of inflation and expectations no longer declining suggests a stabilization, which aligns with a neutral stance where the Committee is neither particularly hawkish (aiming to tighten policy) nor dovish (aiming to ease policy). They are acknowledging the current state of inflation without indicating a clear direction for future policy changes."
0,The ebbing of stimulus from last year's tax cuts also could tend to slow growth in consumer spending.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected slowdown in consumer spending due to the diminishing effects of previous tax cuts, which is an observation of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC will either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges a factor that could influence economic growth."
0,"M2 expanded in February, however, as liquid deposits resumed their growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""M2 expanded in February, however, as liquid deposits resumed their growth"" is a statement of fact regarding the growth of a monetary aggregate (M2, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money). It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The expansion of M2 could be the result of previous policy actions, but without additional context on the desired direction of policy or the implications for inflation and employment, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. It is simply a neutral observation."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is slack in the economy, with resources not being fully utilized, which is expected to lead to a decrease in core price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is anticipated to moderate on its own due to underutilization in the economy. This dovish stance aligns with a potential easing of policy to support employment and economic activity until resources are more fully utilized."
1,"Once such expectations became imbedded in the economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order to reestablish a downward trend of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that to prevent inflation expectations from becoming entrenched, the FOMC might need to take more aggressive policy actions, which typically means raising interest rates or tightening monetary policy. This stance is aimed at curbing inflation and aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC."
2,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will make decisions on the timing and size of adjustments to the federal funds rate based on how actual and expected economic conditions compare to its goals of maximum employment and a symmetric 2 percent inflation target. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather communicates a balanced approach that will depend on future economic data. It reflects a commitment to adjusting policy as needed to achieve its dual mandate, without a current bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the FOMC's decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate was expected by market participants and did not cause significant market movement. This indicates that the FOMC's action was in line with market expectations and did not signal a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of ""extended period"" language suggests a commitment to maintaining the current policy stance for some time, which is consistent with a neutral policy position aimed at fostering the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a shift in policy direction."
0,"Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff of the FOMC perceives a higher likelihood of slower GDP growth and a potential increase in the unemployment rate. This suggests concerns about economic weakness, which would typically lead to a dovish stance, favoring more accommodative monetary policy to support economic growth and employment."
2,"In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had increased from very low levels, and house prices appeared to be stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations in the residential real estate sector, noting improvements in home sales and construction, as well as stabilization in house prices. This information is indicative of economic conditions but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing. It reflects a balanced view of the housing market without implying immediate action by the FOMC."
2,Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year; sustained outsized gains in productivity could further damp hiring.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where increased productivity growth could potentially reduce the need for hiring, which is a neutral observation regarding monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions. The impact on employment is noted, but without a clear indication of how this would affect the FOMC's stance on the monetary policy, it remains a neutral statement."
1,"Later in the week, however, market interest rates moved up in response to the release of the minutes of the February meeting and the mention therein of some sentiment for a larger policy tightening than had been undertaken.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market interest rates increased after the release of the FOMC minutes, which mentioned that some members had a sentiment for a larger policy tightening than what was executed. This suggests that there was a consideration or preference among some FOMC members for a more aggressive approach to tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that even though there was a significant rise in the consumer price index, which suggests higher inflation, the measures of inflation expectations did not change much. The fact that inflation expectations are stable but above pre-crisis levels (before Hurricane Katrina) could imply that the market anticipates some level of inflationary pressure. This scenario might lead the FOMC to consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decrease to levels below what is considered consistent with the FOMC's goals of price stability and maximum employment. This anticipated slowdown in inflation is attributed to recent declines in energy and commodity prices, as well as a period of significant economic slack. The expectation of lower inflation typically reduces the urgency for tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that economic activity is stronger than expected and that inflation pressures may be increasing. This indicates a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. A hawkish stance typically involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to slow down economic growth and curb inflation."
2,"However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak."" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of U.S. monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides an observation of economic conditions in other countries, which might be considered in the broader context of global economic conditions but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action by the FOMC. The FOMC's policy decisions are primarily focused on U.S. economic conditions and their mandate of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to adjust policy in a balanced manner, aiming to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a measured approach to future policy changes. This balanced approach reflects a neutral stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction but emphasizes adherence to the FOMC's long-term objectives."
2,Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above-trend pace of economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members believe a stronger labor market or an economy growing faster than its trend rate could influence their outlook, which is likely related to monetary policy decisions. This implies that if the labor market continues to strengthen or if economic activity exceeds the trend pace, it could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to control inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The focus on preventing the economy from running too hot is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have reached a consensus to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, suggesting that they believe the existing policy is suitable for achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This decision reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy without signaling any immediate intention to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
2,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected pattern of economic growth relative to the staff's estimate of potential growth, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that output is expected to grow slightly above potential in the near term and then slow down, which does not inherently signal a need for either tightening or easing of policy. The statement is simply providing an economic forecast, which is a common component of FOMC statements used to inform policy decisions but does not in itself convey a specific policy stance."
1,"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the members of the FOMC acknowledge that real short-term interest rates are at a level that could be considered restrictive, which implies that the current monetary policy is tight. A restrictive monetary policy is typically associated with higher interest rates to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This suggests that the FOMC is leaning towards preventing the economy from overheating and keeping inflation in check, rather than stimulating growth or employment."
2,The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary tool for adjusting monetary policy—the target range for the federal funds rate—but does not indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It simply states the mechanism the Committee uses to influence monetary conditions to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is currently inclined to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates, thus it is considered a neutral statement regarding policy stance."
0,"With home prices depressed, housing construction was quite subdued and seen as likely to remain so, while investment in nonresidential structures remained low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is weakness in the housing market, with low home prices and subdued housing construction, as well as continued low investment in nonresidential structures. This suggests that the economy might not be overheating, and there may be no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to cool down inflation. Instead, the FOMC might consider maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic activity in these sectors, aligning with a dovish stance that aims to stimulate growth and employment in the face of weak economic indicators."
0,The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to making adjustments to its securities holdings based on new information to support its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows a readiness to respond to economic changes as necessary. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction to achieve its dual mandate."
2,"Consumer credit jumped in May and remained strong in June, reflecting a rebound in credit card balances and continued robust growth in auto loans.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of consumer behavior, noting an increase in consumer credit and robust growth in auto loans, but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need for easing (which would be dovish). It simply reports on economic activity related to consumer credit without a clear implication for the direction of monetary policy."
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current monetary policy settings are aligned with the FOMC members' expectations for economic growth and inflation, suggesting that the current policy stance is appropriate for achieving their objectives. There is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease the policy, which implies a balanced approach consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where, in the absence of economic shocks and with appropriate monetary policy, there is an expectation of moderate economic growth and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate. This suggests a balanced view that does not explicitly indicate a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a steady outlook that aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear shift in policy stance."
0,"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is not only currently low but also expected to decrease slightly in the near future. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a dovish stance would be more accommodating to support employment and economic growth when inflation is below the targeted rate."
0,"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if the recent productivity gains continue, the potential output might be higher than what is currently measured, suggesting that the economy could be performing better than standard indicators show. This could mean that the unemployment rate is a more reliable indicator of economic slack. In this context, if the economy is stronger than expected, there may be less need for an accommodative monetary policy stance, and the FOMC might consider tightening policy to prevent overheating and control inflation. The mention of sustained productivity gains and a potentially underestimated output level indicates a bias towards concerns about inflation and the need to manage it, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"M2 and M3 have posted very large gains in recent months, reflecting the effects of recent System easing actions on market interest rates and shifts of funds by households out of investments in equities and lower-rated corporate debt.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there have been significant increases in the money supply (M2 and M3), which is a result of recent easing actions by the Federal Reserve. This could suggest that the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures that could arise from an expanded money supply, especially if these gains are deemed excessive in relation to the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2%. The reference to ""recent System easing actions"" implies that there has been a recent period of monetary policy easing, and the observed large gains in money supply might prompt a shift towards a more hawkish stance to maintain price stability."
1,"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the potential negative consequences of further asset purchases, such as complications in withdrawing policy accommodation, inflationary risks, and threats to financial stability. These concerns suggest a cautious or skeptical view of further easing measures, implying a preference for either maintaining the current level of monetary policy or preparing for a tightening to prevent these risks, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,Domestic respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that domestic respondents are tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand, which suggests a contractionary or tightening monetary policy stance. Tightening lending standards can be a response to concerns about economic overheating, inflation, or financial stability, which aligns with a hawkish approach to curb potential inflationary pressures and ensure moderate long-term interest rates. The weaker loan demand could also reflect the impact of previous monetary policy tightening, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aimed at slowing down an economy to prevent inflation."
2,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a very low federal funds rate target range and signals a commitment to keep rates low until their employment and inflation objectives are met. Specifically, the FOMC is looking for labor market conditions that align with their view of maximum employment and inflation that not only reaches but moderately exceeds 2 percent for some time. This suggests a willingness to allow the economy to run hotter than usual without tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The dovish stance is aimed at supporting economic activity and employment, and it suggests that the FOMC does not see immediate inflationary pressures that would warrant an increase in interest rates."
2,"Although participants had revised downward their projections for growth since their previous forecasts in June, they continued to anticipate that economic growth would pick up and the unemployment rate would decline gradually through 2014.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a downward revision in growth projections, there is still an expectation of economic improvement and a gradual decrease in unemployment. This suggests a balanced view that does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The anticipation of growth and declining unemployment aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the statement does not provide a clear direction on the stance of monetary policy."
1,"They also generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect that continued gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would align with the goals of economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and achieving the inflation target. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"With regard to the nation as a whole, members noted that rising levels of employment and incomes were continuing to foster solid growth in consumer spending, a development that was abetted by the sharp increases that had occurred in household wealth as a consequence of the extended uptrend in stock market prices and to a lesser extent the appreciation of home prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that rising employment and incomes are leading to solid growth in consumer spending, which is further supported by increases in household wealth due to rising stock market prices and home values. This scenario suggests a strong economy with potential inflationary pressures, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider this an indication to raise interest rates or take other actions to slow down economic growth to maintain their target inflation rate and ensure long-term stability."
0,"Real GDP was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise, on net, in the first half of this year.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of economic contraction (decline in Real GDP) and a worsening labor market (increase in the unemployment rate), which typically would lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment. This dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that fiscal policy will be less expansionary but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of the fiscal environment, which is one of many factors the FOMC considers when determining monetary policy. The statement does not explicitly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy in response to fiscal policy changes, thus it is neutral with respect to the stance of monetary policy."
2,These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an observation of economic conditions, specifically unemployment rates, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest immediate concerns about inflation or employment that would warrant a tightening or easing of policy. Instead, it describes expected ranges for unemployment, which seem to be within a range that does not necessitate a change in policy stance. The FOMC often uses such projections as a baseline for their policy decisions, but this statement alone does not advocate for a particular action."
0,Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations, as measured by surveys, have decreased. Lower inflation expectations can signal that inflationary pressures are subsiding, which might reduce the urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This dovish sentiment suggests that the FOMC might lean towards maintaining or easing monetary policy rather than tightening it, as there is less concern about inflation exceeding their target."
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is expected to stay low, with no significant change from previous forecasts. This suggests that there may be less pressure to increase interest rates, aligning with a more dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity without the immediate threat of high inflation."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3 over a specific period. This action in itself does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a tool for achieving the broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The establishment of growth ranges for monetary aggregates is a technical decision and does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish stance without additional context on the economic conditions and the reasons behind choosing those particular ranges."
1,"Household expenditures on new homes were likewise at an elevated level, although members reported weakness in some price segments and geographic areas of the housing market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed situation in the housing market, with high household expenditures on new homes but also noting weakness in certain price segments and geographic areas. This indicates a balanced view of the housing market, without a clear direction towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the economic conditions rather than a commitment to a change in policy stance."
1,The members agreed that the statement to be issued after this meeting should highlight their view that even after their firming today the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation pressures.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed situation in the housing market, with high household expenditures on new homes but also noting weakness in certain price segments and geographic areas. This indicates a balanced view of the housing market, without a clear direction towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the economic conditions rather than a commitment to a change in policy stance."
2,"In the near term, the 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices, will rise above the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that there may be upward pressure on prices, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too high, in line with the FOMC's mandate to ensure stable prices."
1,"With capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies concerns about potential inflationary pressures due to high levels of capacity utilization and rapid inventory investment, which could lead to an overheating economy if final demand also exceeds projections. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, in line with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of the housing market, noting a slowdown in the rate of house price increases. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is simply a descriptive remark on a particular economic condition, which could be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The slowdown in house price appreciation could have various implications for employment, inflation, and interest rates, but the sentence itself does not convey a clear policy direction."
0,The October SLOOS suggested that the recent slowdown in mortgage originations for home purchases was partly attributable to weaker demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is a slowdown in mortgage originations due to weaker demand, which is a factual observation rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides information on current economic conditions related to housing market activity. This information could be used to inform the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy."
2,"However, several participants pointed out that the 3-month change in that index had firmed recently, signaling some improvement in the inflation outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there has been a recent firming in a particular index, which is interpreted by several participants as an improvement in the inflation outlook. This could imply that inflation is moving closer to the FOMC's target, potentially reducing the need for an accommodative monetary policy stance and opening the door for tightening measures to prevent overheating. The mention of ""improvement in the inflation outlook"" indicates a concern for rising inflation, which is typically addressed by a hawkish policy stance, such as raising interest rates."
2,Data received over the intermeeting period reinforced earlier indications that real GDP growth had turned up after having been slow in the first quarter of this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that real GDP growth has increased after a slow first quarter, which suggests an improving economy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, stronger economic growth could lead to higher inflationary pressures. If the economy is growing faster than anticipated, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggesting that long-term unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment does.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are skeptical about the idea that long-term unemployment exerts less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment. This skepticism could imply that they believe even long-term unemployment can still put downward pressure on inflation, which might not necessitate an easing of monetary policy. If they believe that all forms of unemployment should be considered in assessing inflationary pressures, they may be more inclined to support a tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Kocherlakota believes the Committee's forward guidance is not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing measures to raise inflation to the 2 percent target. His dissent suggests that he advocates for a more accommodative policy stance to address inflation that is persistently below the desired level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. This dovish stance implies a preference for easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and push inflation towards the Committee's goal."
1,"On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that recent fiscal policy changes might result in a stronger expansion of economic activity than currently projected, which could potentially lead to higher inflation or overheating of the economy. In response to such an outcome, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that if the slower rate of price declines in high-tech products indicates a reduction in the pace of technological advancement, this could lead to lower investment demand and a decrease in the expected high growth rate of productivity. This scenario implies potential economic softening, which might lead the FOMC to consider an easing of monetary policy to support investment and productivity growth, aligning with a dovish stance."
0,Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5."" does not provide a complete context or direction for monetary policy. An increase in the unemployment rate could be interpreted as a sign of a weakening economy, which might suggest a dovish stance if the FOMC were to consider easing policy to stimulate employment. However, without additional context on the reasons for the increase or its implications for inflation and long-term interest rates, it is not possible to determine a clear policy direction. Therefore, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic condition (large current account deficits due to vigorous domestic imports) without directly suggesting an immediate action in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a potential issue (worrisome implications for the future) but does not indicate a clear stance on how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. The focus is on the trade balance rather than directly on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while core inflation rates are currently below the FOMC's 2% target, there is an expectation that inflation will stabilize around the target level due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests a balance between concerns about current inflation levels and confidence in future inflation dynamics, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The Committee appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, which is typically considered a neutral stance."
1,"In the view of one member, however, aggregate final demand was so strong that, with economic activity and the associated demand for labor having expanded at an unsustainable pace for some time, one could be reasonably confident that inflation would most likely pick up in the absence of policy action.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that a member of the FOMC believes that the strong aggregate final demand and rapid expansion of economic activity and labor demand are unsustainable and likely to lead to increased inflation unless the Committee takes policy action. This suggests a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary policy in order to promote employment and price stability. This is particularly dovish as it implies a willingness to potentially lower interest rates or engage in other stimulative actions during challenging economic times to achieve the FOMC's goals."
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members perceive significant risks to the economic outlook and believe that lowering interest rates would serve as a precaution against potential economic downturns. This stance suggests a move towards easing monetary policy to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish approach."
0,"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation has been low recently and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which suggests there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish approach."
0,The disruptions to global economic activity had significantly affected financial conditions and impaired the flow of credit to U. S. households and businesses.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that global economic disruptions have negatively impacted financial conditions and credit flow to U.S. households and businesses. This suggests a potential easing of monetary policy to counteract the adverse effects on credit availability and support economic activity, aligning with a dovish stance that favors measures to stimulate the economy."
1,"Looking to the future, however, the members generally agreed that the risks were in the direction of a heightening in inflation pressures despite their belief that growth in overall demand now seemed to have declined to a more sustainable pace and probably would continue to expand for a time at a rate below that of the economy's output potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about the potential for increased inflation pressures in the future, despite a slowdown in demand growth to a more sustainable pace. This concern for rising inflation suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The mention of risks tilted towards higher inflation pressures is particularly indicative of a hawkish view, as it implies readiness to act against inflation, even if the current demand growth is below the economy's potential output."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance."" This suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring economic indicators and may be prepared to act, possibly by raising interest rates, to curb inflation or address other economic concerns, in line with their goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""asymmetric directive"" implies that there is a greater likelihood of tightening than easing, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a specific observation about economic conditions, particularly in the area of expenditures on nonresidential structures, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not imply an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy but rather provides information that would be part of the broader analysis the FOMC uses to make decisions. The focus on expenditures on nonresidential structures is a reflection of economic activity, but the sentence does not indicate whether this will lead to a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"The Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee expressing readiness to adjust policy as necessary to support economic growth and maintain price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a willingness to respond to changing economic conditions to achieve its goals."
1,"In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC does not anticipate immediate or strong inflationary pressures, suggesting that there is no urgent need to tighten monetary policy aggressively. The mention of price pressures emerging ""only gradually"" and being ""reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment"" indicates a stance that leans towards maintaining or easing current policy rather than tightening it. This dovish stance is consistent with a cautious approach to raising interest rates or implementing contractionary measures, as the FOMC sees the potential inflationary pressures as manageable with minor adjustments."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which does not clearly signal a need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy action."
2,"However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is no current need to provide additional forward guidance to lower interest rates further, implying that the FOMC does not see a necessity for further easing of monetary policy at this time. This stance leans toward maintaining or potentially tightening monetary policy rather than introducing measures to decrease interest rates, which would be considered dovish. The reference to the lack of scope for forward guidance to exert more downward pressure on yields indicates a tilt against further monetary policy accommodation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in price inflation, the core inflation (excluding volatile energy prices) remains relatively subdued. This suggests that the FOMC does not see immediate inflationary pressures that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy (which would be hawkish), nor does it indicate a need for easing (which would be dovish). The statement appears to be balanced, reflecting an observation without a clear directional policy implication."
2,"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is focused on the current inflation rate being below their 2 percent target. The use of ""carefully monitor"" suggests that they are prepared to take action to increase inflation to reach their goal, which typically involves easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity. This dovish stance implies a readiness to implement measures that would support rising inflation towards the desired level, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance if inflation were above the target."
2,"Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, similarly, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is open to adjusting the pace of interest rate increases based on incoming data related to employment and inflation. The mention of potentially raising rates sooner if progress toward their objectives is faster than expected suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a hawkish stance. Conversely, the willingness to delay rate increases if progress is slower aligns with a more cautious approach, but the overall tone leans toward hawkishness due to the emphasis on responding to signs of quicker progress with higher rates."
1,"The pace of inventory liquidation was thought likely to moderate in coming quarters and subsequently turn to accumulation as inventories came into better balance with sales, with increasingly positive implications for overall production and economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about inventory adjustments and their potential impact on production and economic activity. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The statement is focused on economic forecasting and does not suggest an immediate action in terms of adjusting the monetary stance."
0,"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see a higher likelihood of inflation falling rather than rising, especially in the short term. This view is based on the presence of significant unused economic capacity (resource slack), potential negative impacts on economic growth (downside risks to real activity), and the chance that inflation expectations might decrease due to currently low inflation levels. A dovish stance is typically associated with a preference for looser monetary policy to support economic growth and prevent deflationary pressures, which aligns with the concerns expressed in the sentence about the risks of low inflation and economic underperformance."
2,"With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic conditions without explicitly indicating a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests that real GDP growth is expected to slow down to a rate that is in line with the economy's potential output, which is a neutral stance as it does not imply immediate concerns over inflationary pressures or employment shortfalls that would necessitate a clear dovish or hawkish response. The statement is simply forecasting a return to what could be considered a normal growth rate, aligning with the FOMC's long-term goals for stable growth."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of observation regarding economic conditions abroad, which could potentially impact the U.S. economy and thus the FOMC's policy decisions. However, without additional context on how this outlook would affect the FOMC's policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, it remains a neutral statement. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the monetary policy stance."
1,"After robust growth in the second quarter, M2 decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the growth of money supply (M2) has slowed down and M3 remained stable, without directly indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply reports on recent monetary conditions without suggesting a need for either tightening or easing of policy. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but in itself, it does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the U.S. dollar has strengthened due to rising U.S. interest rates, which typically suggests a tightening of monetary policy. Higher interest rates can attract foreign capital, increasing demand for the dollar, and are often used to control inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The reference to market expectations of U.S. tax reform potentially stimulating the economy could also imply a future need for tighter monetary policy to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check."
1,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members gave considerable attention to the somewhat faster increases in broad price measures over the past year, but they differed to some extent regarding the prospects for further increases in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are acknowledging faster increases in broad price measures, which could suggest concern over inflation—a potentially hawkish stance. However, the fact that they ""differed to some extent regarding the prospects for further increases in inflation"" implies that there is no clear consensus on whether inflation will continue to rise, which could be interpreted as neither clearly hawkish nor dovish. The lack of a unified view on the future path of inflation suggests a balanced or uncertain outlook, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
1,Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about persistent inflationary pressures stemming from rising healthcare and insurance costs, as well as the delayed effect of significant oil price increases. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these inflationary forces and achieve its goal of stable prices with a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"Industrial production had slipped in recent months and private payroll employment had changed little, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where industrial production has declined and private payroll employment has stagnated, but labor productivity has continued to increase. This combination of factors does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The decline in industrial production and stagnant employment could be seen as signs of economic weakness, potentially warranting a dovish stance. However, the strong upward trend in labor productivity could offset concerns about economic slowdown and might not necessitate an immediate policy response. Therefore, the sentence does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, making it neutral."
2,Members agreed that the statement should continue to convey that inflation risks remained of greatest concern and that additional policy firming was possible.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where industrial production has declined and private payroll employment has stagnated, but labor productivity has continued to increase. This combination of factors does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The decline in industrial production and stagnant employment could be seen as signs of economic weakness, potentially warranting a dovish stance. However, the strong upward trend in labor productivity could offset concerns about economic slowdown and might not necessitate an immediate policy response. Therefore, the sentence does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, making it neutral."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation compared to the previous year, due to rising prices in specific sectors such as food and non-energy imports. This expectation of increased inflation could suggest a need for a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to higher inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
1,"Private investors would have to hold more longer-term securities as the Federal Reserve's holdings ran off, making longer-term interest rates somewhat higher than they would be otherwise.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is reducing its holdings of longer-term securities, which would lead to an increase in longer-term interest rates as private investors are required to hold more of these securities. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as higher long-term interest rates can slow economic activity and help control inflation, aligning with the goal of stable prices."
1,"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation regarding the balance of trade, with imports expected to grow more than exports, based on current forecasts of U.S. domestic demand recovery. This statement does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more of an economic forecast and does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. The sentence reflects an analysis of economic conditions, which is a part of the FOMC's process in making informed decisions, but it does not in itself advocate for a particular policy action."
1,"These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to taking action to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, suggesting a willingness to tighten monetary policy now to avoid more severe measures in the future. This stance aligns with a proactive approach to maintaining price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals, even at the potential cost of short-term economic restraint."
1,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflationary pressures arising from sharply rising medical costs and efforts to shield wages from the impact of increasing energy prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent these factors from pushing inflation above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflation and maintain price stability, which is one of the FOMC's primary goals."
1,"Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of uneven employment expansion suggests that the labor market is not consistently robust across sectors or regions, which could be a concern for the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the strong upward trend in labor productivity is a positive sign, potentially indicating efficiency gains that could lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflationary pressures. Since the sentence presents a mixed view with both a potentially negative and positive aspect, it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
1,All members agreed that the risks to achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation remained of greatest concern.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that all members of the FOMC are primarily worried about the risks of not achieving the anticipated reduction in inflation. This concern suggests that the Committee is focused on combating higher inflation, which typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to cool down the economy and bring inflation rates down to their target level."
0,"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic indicators showing a reduction in the rate of decline for payroll employment and industrial production. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an update on economic conditions. The statement indicates that while there are still declines, the situation may be stabilizing, which could be seen as a neutral stance in the context of monetary policy, as it does not clearly advocate for a change in policy direction."
2,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of slower growth in the money supply measures M2 and M3, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. This could be seen as a move to control inflation by reducing the amount of money in circulation, aligning with the goal of stable prices. Slowing the growth of the money supply is typically a tool used to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a hawkish stance."
2,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation are low, and longer-term inflation expectations have not significantly changed. This suggests that there is no clear pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone. The FOMC might view this as a sign that current policy is broadly aligned with their inflation objectives, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"While favorable financing would help to sustain the housing sector, members anticipated that any further impetus to growth from that sector was likely to be limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while favorable financing conditions could support the housing sector, the FOMC members do not expect significant additional growth from this sector. This suggests a balanced view without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an expectation of steady conditions in the housing market, which is just one component of the broader economy, and does not directly imply a change in the stance of monetary policy."
0,"Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the labor market, specifically the high number of part-time workers due to economic reasons and a low average workweek, which suggests that the economy is not at full employment. This implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support a reduction in unemployment, consistent with a dovish stance that prioritizes boosting economic activity and employment."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that could affect its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to economic conditions, which is a neutral stance. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals, without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy adjustment."
0,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates expectations about future price developments for specific sectors (energy and housing), but it does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The expectation that energy prices will level out and rents may decelerate implies a belief that inflationary pressures in these areas could ease, but the sentence does not commit to a policy change. It reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance."
0,"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth and a slow reduction in unemployment, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests a steady approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without signaling immediate concerns that would prompt a change in policy stance."
2,The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff of the FOMC views the recent increases in consumer price inflation, specifically from energy and nonmarket services, as largely transitory rather than permanent. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a need to respond with tighter monetary policy (such as raising interest rates) to combat inflation that is expected to be temporary. A dovish stance typically involves maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic growth, under the assumption that inflationary pressures are not a long-term concern."
2,"Real GDP growth was expected to step down in 2022 and 2023 but still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff of the FOMC views the recent increases in consumer price inflation, specifically from energy and nonmarket services, as largely transitory rather than permanent. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a need to respond with tighter monetary policy (such as raising interest rates) to combat inflation that is expected to be temporary. A dovish stance typically involves maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic growth, under the assumption that inflationary pressures are not a long-term concern."
2,"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the housing sector, noting strong demand, moderate mortgage rates, and positive consumer sentiment. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's goals, without suggesting a particular policy action."
1,The staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loosened further.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that in the leveraged loan market, risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loosened further, which suggests an increase in risk-taking and potentially more financial market exuberance. This could be a concern for the FOMC if it leads to financial imbalances or contributes to inflationary pressures. In response to such developments, the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to mitigate financial risks and maintain price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Household spending is increasing gradually, but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that household spending is growing slowly due to several restraining factors such as high unemployment, modest income growth, reduced housing wealth, and tight credit conditions. This suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to cool down inflation pressures. Instead, the statement implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even ease further to support economic growth and help address the issues of unemployment and income growth, consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Although prospects for economic activity had not deteriorated significantly since the March meeting, the outlook for growth and employment remained weak and slack in resource utilization was likely to increase.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economic outlook for growth and employment is weak and that there is likely to be an increase in slack in resource utilization. This suggests that the economy is not performing at its full potential, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment, in line with its commitment to maximum employment and stable prices. The absence of significant deterioration since the last meeting does not change the overall dovish tone, as the focus is on the weakness in the outlook and the potential for increased slack, which are conditions that typically warrant a more accommodative policy approach."
0,Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters"" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation regarding the impact of fiscal policy on economic growth. This statement is more of an observation of external economic conditions rather than a signal of the FOMC's future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC will adjust its policy in response to the fiscal policy's impact on growth."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic forecast has been revised down due to the impact of federal spending cuts, which suggests a slowing down of economic activity. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as the economy is not overheating, and instead, there might be a need for a more accommodative stance to counteract the negative effects of reduced government spending on growth."
2,"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment; another indicated that the Committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a participant is suggesting more accommodative policy measures, such as setting lower thresholds for inflation and unemployment or committing not to raise the federal funds rate if inflation is expected to remain below a certain level. These suggestions imply a willingness to keep monetary policy easier to support employment and to prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term goal, which aligns with a dovish stance."
1,These downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its longer-run potential.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could rise more than expected if the economy grows beyond its longer-run potential. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that although input costs have risen, this increase is not substantially affecting consumer prices. This indicates that inflationary pressures from higher input costs are not strong, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might view this as a situation where current policy can remain unchanged, as the impact on their inflation target is limited, thus reflecting a neutral stance."
2,"In contrast, CRE loan growth at banks was weak in July and August, likely partly driven by the recovery of CMBS markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific observation in the credit market, noting that commercial real estate (CRE) loan growth was weak, which could be due to the recovery of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) markets. This statement is merely an assessment of market conditions and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Instead, it provides context on financial market developments, which is part of the broader economic analysis the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It reaffirms the Committee's ongoing commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, without indicating a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a slowdown in output and employment, the FOMC expects that with continued policy accommodation (which typically means keeping interest rates lower or providing other forms of monetary stimulus), economic activity will grow and labor market conditions will improve. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in order to support the economy and move closer to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was set at 3 to 7 percent for the year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a target range for the growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt, which is a monitoring tool rather than a direct indication of a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather sets a benchmark for debt growth that the FOMC will observe. This could be part of their broader analysis to ensure that monetary policy aligns with their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes concerns about the long-term economic effects of the pandemic, such as potential sectoral restructuring and technological disruption, which could impact employment growth and firms' pricing power. It does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of factors that could influence future policy decisions. The focus is on understanding the economic landscape and potential challenges, which is consistent with a balanced approach to monitoring economic developments."
1,"Developments in foreign trade were moderating demands on domestic resources; but with domestic spending strong, members were becoming more concerned that those developments might not exert enough restraint on aggregate demand to slow the expansion to a sustainable pace in line with the growth of the economy's potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern among FOMC members that foreign trade developments might not be sufficient to temper aggregate demand, which could lead to an unsustainable pace of economic expansion. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability, one of their key objectives. The reference to a sustainable pace in line with the economy's potential aligns with the goal of moderate long-term interest rates and maximum employment, but the emphasis on preventing an overly rapid expansion suggests a bias towards a more hawkish stance to avoid inflationary pressures."
0,"Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern that ongoing developments in the housing market could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending, especially if house prices declined significantly.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants are worried about potential negative effects on consumer spending due to issues in the housing market, particularly if house prices were to fall sharply. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent a possible overheating of the housing market and to mitigate the risk of a subsequent decline in consumer spending, which could destabilize the economy. Tightening monetary policy in anticipation of or in response to such risks aligns with a hawkish stance, as it aims to preempt inflationary pressures or economic imbalances."
1,"Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors' improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that equity markets declined due to expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would implement a more restrictive monetary policy than previously anticipated. A more restrictive policy typically means higher interest rates or a reduction in the central bank's balance sheet, both of which are measures to tighten monetary conditions, usually in response to concerns about inflation or financial stability. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions taken to prevent or curb high inflation and to ensure stable prices, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests that the Committee should not be deterred by risks when pursuing its goals, but it does not specify what actions it would take to mitigate those risks. This implies a balanced approach to policy-making, focused on the long-term objectives rather than immediate shifts in policy stance."
1,Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate"" does not explicitly indicate a change in the pace of inflation or a shift in monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the rate of increase in consumer prices, without suggesting whether this rate is too high, too low, or in line with the Federal Reserve's inflation target. Therefore, it does not clearly signal a tightening or easing of monetary policy, making it a neutral statement in terms of policy stance."
0,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there are factors expected to limit economic growth, which implies that the FOMC might lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to support the expansion and counteract those restraining factors. This aligns with the dovish approach of stimulating the economy when it is not growing at the desired pace."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that labor market conditions had improved further in late 2015 even as economic growth slowed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an improvement in labor market conditions, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, it also mentions that economic growth has slowed, which could be a concern for the FOMC's objective of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not explicitly suggest a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides a balanced view of the economic conditions, with positive developments in employment being offset by slower economic growth. This balance suggests a neutral stance, as the FOMC may be weighing the trade-offs between these two aspects of the economy."
1,The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the projection for core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation has been raised due to higher recent readings, which suggests that inflation is trending higher than previously expected. A higher inflation projection often leads to a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. Therefore, the statement implies a potential move towards a more hawkish stance to counteract rising inflation."
2,"Crude oil prices, though volatile, had not risen appreciably in recent months on balance, and a flattening in energy prices was beginning to damp headline inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that crude oil prices have not increased significantly and that stable energy prices are contributing to a reduction in overall inflation. This suggests that there may be less pressure to adjust monetary policy aggressively in either direction to combat inflation, as one of the primary drivers of inflation (energy prices) is not exhibiting upward volatility. The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) or easing (which would be dovish) of monetary policy, but rather it presents an observation of current market conditions that are within the expected range, supporting a neutral stance."
1,"The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee plans to make further gradual adjustments to tighten monetary policy. The expectation that economic activity will continue to expand and labor market conditions will remain strong suggests that the FOMC is focused on preventing the economy from overheating, which aligns with a hawkish stance aimed at controlling inflation and maintaining stable prices without necessarily prioritizing further easing of monetary policy."
0,"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic outlook, noting that strong fundamentals such as low interest rates, wide profit margins, and high levels of liquid assets are expected to support future expenditures on software and equipment. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic conditions. It suggests that the economy has a solid foundation for growth, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not signal a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in response to these conditions."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has observed a slowdown in economic growth, which is partly attributed to a significant cooling in the housing market. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds, and the FOMC may consider easing monetary policy to support growth and prevent further slowdown, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity. This approach would be consistent with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, especially if the cooling housing market threatens these objectives."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will base future policy adjustments on incoming economic data related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a data-dependent approach that does not commit to either tightening or easing monetary policy ahead of time. The stance is balanced and contingent on how the economic outlook evolves, aligning with the FOMC's principles of being responsive to changing economic conditions while pursuing its goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees no immediate need to tighten monetary policy because inflation is low and there is slack in resource utilization. This suggests a stance towards easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation, as there is no pressure to combat high inflation or overheating in the economy, which aligns with a dovish policy stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process by which FOMC participants provide their economic projections, which is a standard part of monetary policy formulation. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather outlines the method by which the Committee members communicate their expectations for future economic conditions. These projections help inform the Committee's policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy stance."
1,"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where external factors (resolution of hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices) could lead to positive economic outcomes such as a boost in equity markets, consumer sentiment, and consumer spending. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather discusses potential economic developments that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC might adjust its policy in response to these changes, but the sentence itself does not commit to either tightening or easing."
2,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, suggesting a balanced approach to monetary policy. The use of ""slightly higher"" or ""somewhat lower"" implies small adjustments rather than significant shifts, reflecting a stance that is neither clearly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish). The Committee's decision is presented as contingent on a range of economic, financial, and monetary developments, which aligns with a neutral policy stance that is responsive to changing conditions while pursuing long-term objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth."
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically the high demand for Treasury securities and the resulting low overnight repo rate, as well as the high number of failures to deliver Treasury securities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of financial market phenomena. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"By contrast, economic activity in China and other developing countries showed greater buoyancy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic conditions in China and other developing countries, noting that there is greater buoyancy in their economic activity. This observation does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of U.S. monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It is merely a statement of economic conditions abroad, which might be one of many factors considered by the FOMC. However, without a clear indication of how this buoyancy affects the U.S. economy or the FOMC's policy decisions, the sentence itself does not suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Consumer food prices were little changed in August.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Consumer food prices were little changed in August"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the stability of consumer food prices within a specific time frame, which suggests that there is neither significant inflationary pressure in this category that would warrant a hawkish response, nor deflationary pressure that would require a dovish response. It reflects a situation that is consistent with stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals, without providing information on whether policy adjustments are needed."
2,"These members indicated that the economic outlook remained positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee's 2 percent objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the members believe the current economic conditions are positive and expect continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth, with inflation moving towards the target, all under an unchanged policy stance. This suggests that the current policy is appropriate for achieving the FOMC's goals and does not signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is currently low and any increase in inflationary pressures is expected to rise slowly. This indicates that there is no immediate concern for inflation to overshoot the FOMC's target, which would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The mention of strong demand in the context of stable financial conditions implies that the economy is performing well without generating significant inflation, which could justify a more accommodative stance or at least no rush to tighten policy. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, as it suggests there is no pressing need to increase interest rates to combat high inflation."
0,Several participants reported feedback from business contacts who were delaying hiring until the economic and regulatory outlook became more certain and who indicated that they expected to meet any near-term increase in the demand for their products without boosting employment; these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where businesses are hesitant to hire due to economic and regulatory uncertainty, and they plan to meet demand without increasing employment. This reflects a concern about the pace of improvement in the unemployment rate but does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It indicates a wait-and-see approach, considering the risks to the employment component of the FOMC's mandate without committing to a specific policy direction."
0,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition where residential construction activity is strong, and this is partially attributed to recent declines in mortgage interest rates. This observation does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the housing market and its relationship with interest rates, without suggesting a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC may view this as a positive development towards their goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
1,"Potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that delaying policy tightening could lead to more aggressive actions in the future and might undermine the credibility of the Federal Reserve's commitment to controlling inflation. This implies a stance in favor of earlier and possibly more gradual tightening to prevent future economic disruption and maintain the Fed's anti-inflationary stance, aligning with a hawkish view."
2,"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various factors that are supporting consumer spending, which is a component of economic activity, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and retail discounting are external economic factors that can influence consumer behavior, but the sentence does not suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states conditions that are affecting consumer spending without implying a direction for policy adjustment."
0,"The Committee also noted in March that although output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had lagged, and increases in core consumer prices were muted and expected to remain low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while economic output is growing, the pace of new hiring is slow, and core consumer price increases are muted with expectations to remain low. This suggests that there is no immediate concern for inflationary pressures, which aligns with a dovish stance where there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy. The FOMC may be more inclined to maintain or lower interest rates to support employment growth without the risk of triggering high inflation, thus leaning towards an easing of monetary policy."
1,"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that additional fiscal stimulus is expected to lead to a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, higher inflation expectations (inflation compensation), and a weaker dollar. These outcomes suggest that the economy might be heating up, which could lead to higher inflation. In response to such conditions, the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is uncertainty about the amount of unused economic capacity (resource slack) and raises the possibility that the economy could be operating close to its potential output. This implies that if employment continues to increase without a corresponding rise in labor force participation, the economy might experience upward pressure on inflation. The mention of the economy potentially operating close to potential often indicates a concern for overheating, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected economic condition related to the foreign exchange value of the dollar and its impact on exports and imports, without directly suggesting an immediate action in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the influence of exchange rates on trade balance but does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. The FOMC might consider this information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
