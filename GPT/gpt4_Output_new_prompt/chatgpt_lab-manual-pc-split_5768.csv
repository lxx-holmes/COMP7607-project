2,"So that’s in the low 20s, and that’s post the May employment report.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement regarding a specific data point, likely related to employment figures, following the release of the May employment report. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it seems to be part of a broader discussion or analysis of economic conditions without a specific policy direction implied."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC believed its current monetary policy stance was appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects at the time of their meeting. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the existing policy settings in relation to the economic outlook at that moment. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
2,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on."" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an observation about market conditions, specifically an increased demand for financial services related to risk management and liquidity. This does not inherently suggest a move towards raising or lowering interest rates or adjusting monetary supply, which are typical actions associated with hawkish or dovish stances, respectively. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine how the FOMC might respond to this increased demand in terms of its policy stance."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing unemployment and addressing the negative impacts of long-term joblessness. This suggests a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job creation and economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish stance. The emphasis on bringing people back to work aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, and there is no mention of concerns about inflation that might warrant a tightening of policy."
0,"But also we want to see inflation move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and so seeing above-trend growth and continuing tightness—greater tightness in labor and product markets—I think that will help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a desire to see inflation return to the FOMC's 2 percent target, suggesting that the Committee may be willing to accept or even encourage ""above-trend growth"" and ""greater tightness in labor and product markets"" to achieve this. Tighter labor and product markets often lead to upward pressure on wages and prices, which can be a precursor to inflation. The willingness to foster conditions that could lead to higher inflation implies a readiness to potentially tighten monetary policy in the future to ensure that inflation reaches the target level. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation from rising too quickly, even at the risk of potentially slowing down economic growth."
2,That is a positive for growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That is a positive for growth"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states that something is beneficial for economic growth, without providing information on inflation or employment levels. This statement could be consistent with any monetary policy stance, depending on the context, as it does not suggest a need to either tighten or ease policy. It reflects a general positive outlook on growth but does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any specific policy action."
0,"We have a 2 percent symmetric inflation objective, and, for a number of years now, inflation has been running under 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been consistently below the FOMC's target of 2 percent for several years. This suggests that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to raise inflation towards the target level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. A dovish stance typically involves lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity, with the aim of increasing inflation to a desired level and supporting employment."
2,So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical explanation of the concept of ""trend inflation"" and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It merely describes a method for analyzing inflation data, which is a part of the overall process the FOMC uses to make informed decisions. It does not suggest any imminent action to tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is not currently a pressing concern, as it remains ""muted"" and the long-term expectations for inflation are low. This suggests that there is less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would be more accommodative to support employment and economic growth."
0,"During this time of reopening, we are likely to see some upward pressure on prices, and I’ll discuss why.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of inflationary pressures due to economic reopening, which could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract rising prices and maintain the FOMC's goal of stable prices. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies vigilance against potential inflation and a readiness to act to prevent it from exceeding the target rate."
0,"And, and those are—that’s again—that goes to keeping this episode as short as it can be and avoiding unnecessary business bankruptcies, unnecessary household bankruptcies, and unnecessary long-term stays of unemployment or supporting people through them so that they can maintain their financial footing and their lives and be able to go back to work in a productive way.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on supporting the economy to prevent business and household bankruptcies and to minimize long-term unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC is inclined to maintain or introduce measures that ease monetary policy to support economic stability and employment, which aligns with a dovish stance. The emphasis on avoiding economic hardships and ensuring that people can return to work productively implies a readiness to stimulate the economy as needed to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants in the FOMC have adjusted their views on the appropriate path for policy due to a slower projected path for global growth and some tightening in credit conditions. This suggests that they are considering a more restrictive monetary policy stance to counteract these developments, which could potentially lead to higher interest rates or less monetary accommodation. Tightening credit conditions and a response to slower global growth with a policy shift typically align with a hawkish stance, as the focus may be on preventing potential inflationary pressures or financial imbalances."
2,"Inflation, in fact, is under control, and starting to come down.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not a current concern as it is ""under control, and starting to come down."" This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and could even open the door for easing if the trend continues, in order to support maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,It will include all data relevant to our dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to considering all relevant data in pursuit of the FOMC's dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather conveys a balanced approach to policy-making based on a comprehensive assessment of economic indicators."
0,"So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant increase in the U-6 level of unemployment, which is a broader measure of labor underutilization that includes those who are underemployed and marginally attached to the labor force, in addition to the unemployed. This sharp rise suggests a severe weakening in the labor market. While the statement itself does not directly indicate a policy action, the context implies that the FOMC may consider this as a negative economic development that could lead to deflationary pressures or economic stagnation. In response to such conditions, the FOMC might typically adopt a more accommodative stance to stimulate the economy. However, given the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, such a dramatic increase in unemployment could prompt the Committee to take measures to support the labor market and prevent further deterioration, which could be interpreted as a hawkish signal in the context of preventing a downward spiral in employment and economic activity. The classification as ""HAWKISH"" is somewhat counterintuitive in this case, as the traditional response to high unemployment would be easing monetary policy, but the extreme nature of the unemployment increase suggests that the FOMC might be concerned about the long-term risks to the economy and thus consider a range of interventions, including those that might be seen as more aggressive or supportive of employment, which could be interpreted as hawkish in this broader sense."
0,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential overheating in the labor market due to a prolonged period of highly accommodative (easy) monetary policy. The speaker is worried that if the economy remains strong and risks do not materialize, the labor market could become too tight, which might lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the speaker is considering the need for future tightening of monetary policy to prevent such an outcome, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,That should drive productivity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That should drive productivity."" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a neutral statement that suggests an outcome (increased productivity) without specifying whether this would lead to a change in monetary policy. Increased productivity can be associated with both positive economic growth and potential inflationary pressures, but without additional context, the stance on monetary policy cannot be determined."
1,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is becoming more widespread across services, which suggests that inflationary pressures are present and may be increasing. This observation could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to counteract rising inflation and move closer to their target of 2% inflation over the long term. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to reduce liquidity and cool down inflationary trends, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,I would further say that I think it’s important to emphasize that we’re not going to mechanically take the interest rate projections that participants provide and just build policy off of that.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) does not intend to strictly follow the interest rate projections provided by its participants when making policy decisions. This suggests a flexible approach to monetary policy, which does not inherently signal a clear move towards either tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced stance, showing that the FOMC will consider a range of indicators and information beyond just the interest rate projections in its policy-making process."
2,"But—so I would just say that our—that there are many things that go in, as you know, to, to setting asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply acknowledges the complexity of factors that influence asset prices, without suggesting a particular policy action or stance regarding inflation or employment targets."
0,"Last year, we had 1.9 percent productivity, which is much higher.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about productivity levels without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. Higher productivity can be associated with a stronger economy, which might suggest less need for accommodative policies (dovish stance) or could provide room for tightening (hawkish stance) if it leads to inflationary pressures. However, without additional context on how this productivity figure relates to the FOMC's policy decisions or economic outlook, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decline, reaching levels that are potentially below the natural rate of unemployment. This could signal a tightening labor market, which often leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation. In anticipation of these effects, the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an acceptance of inflation running moderately above the 2% target, which suggests that the FOMC may be less inclined to implement aggressive monetary easing measures. This stance implies a tolerance for higher inflation, which could be associated with a tightening of monetary policy to ensure that inflation does not escalate beyond a manageable level. The statement reflects a commitment to price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals, and suggests that the Committee may prioritize controlling inflation over stimulating the economy, which is typically considered a hawkish position."
1,"I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a wait-and-see approach, focusing on the observation of economic indicators such as wages and prices to determine the appropriate monetary policy action. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates that future decisions will be based on the trajectory of inflation. The FOMC is expressing that their actions will be data-dependent, aligning with their goals of stable prices and maximum employment without committing to a specific policy direction until more information on inflation trends is available."
0,"And then, what the statement emphasizes, and this is the same language we used in December and January, we used the language especially if inflation is running below our 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy, particularly if inflation is below the 2% target. This suggests that the FOMC would be inclined to maintain or lower interest rates to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards their objective, rather than tightening policy which would be more likely if inflation were above the target."
0,Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.,"DOVISH

The sentence highlights a significant concern about high levels of long-term unemployment, which suggests that the economy is underperforming in terms of the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. This could imply a need for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment, rather than tightening policy. The focus on a negative employment situation aligns with a dovish approach, where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support job growth and economic recovery."
2,"If we—if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a cautious approach to interpreting inflation data, suggesting that the FOMC would not necessarily react to what it perceives as transitory influences on inflation. This implies a wait-and-see attitude, which is neither explicitly suggesting tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced stance, focused on analyzing data thoroughly before making a policy decision, in line with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and its target inflation rate."
0,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the decline in commodity prices due to softer demand from emerging markets and Europe. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic factors that could influence the FOMC's decision-making. The statement is simply an assessment of current economic conditions without a clear directional policy implication."
0,"Inflation has declined further below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower energy prices I just mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term goal, which is primarily attributed to a decrease in energy prices. This suggests that there is less immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and it could even imply that there may be room for easing to bring inflation back up to the target level. The dovish stance is consistent with a policy that would support increasing inflation towards the 2% target and potentially stimulate economic activity if it is deemed too low."
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests satisfaction with the current policy framework and does not hint at any imminent policy changes to either increase or decrease economic stimulus. The focus on both goals implies a balanced approach to managing economic conditions."
0,"I expect that to continue, and I would expect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employment that’s for economic reasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation for continued improvement in employment conditions, specifically regarding part-time employment for economic reasons. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the employment situation. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but does not suggest immediate policy action, thus it is considered neutral."
2,"So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a prelude to a discussion about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It suggests that the speaker is about to provide information or analysis on the situation but does not in itself signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been rising, which is often a concern for the Federal Reserve as it strives to maintain stable prices, one of its key mandates. The mention of higher prices for commodities and imported goods as the cause of the inflationary pressure suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these inflationary trends and steer inflation back towards its 2% target. Tightening monetary policy could include measures such as raising interest rates."
2,We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a policy goal regarding the size of the balance sheet but does not indicate a current direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing). It simply states a principle for determining the appropriate size of the balance sheet to conduct monetary policy efficiently and effectively, without suggesting any immediate action or change in policy stance."
0,But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the target level of 2 percent. This suggests that if inflation is currently below the target, the FOMC is willing to adopt policies that could increase inflation, which may include lowering interest rates or other expansionary measures. However, the commitment to raising inflation typically implies a readiness to prevent deflation or very low inflation, which can be associated with a hawkish stance if it involves tightening policy to stabilize prices at the desired level."
2,"So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC considers financial market conditions as one of many factors in its decision-making process. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather communicates that financial conditions are a part of the holistic view the FOMC takes when assessing the economy. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"And that, I think, does raise, raise the risk that high inflation will be more persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that high inflation could be more persistent, which implies a risk of inflation running above the FOMC's target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy has not achieved one of the FOMC's key goals, which is maximum employment. This suggests that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support job growth, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance. The mention of not being at maximum employment implies that the FOMC may consider easing policies or at least not increasing interest rates to avoid hindering progress towards this goal."
0,where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September—and we have made some progress since last September,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where unemployment is falling gradually, which is a positive economic indicator, but it does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states an observation of the labor market's progress without indicating a change in policy stance. The mention of progress since last September indicates an ongoing trend rather than a new development that would warrant a shift in policy."
0,We want to see lower unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""We want to see lower unemployment"" suggests a stance that favors policies aimed at stimulating the economy to reduce unemployment. This typically involves keeping interest rates low to encourage borrowing and investment, which can lead to job creation. Since the FOMC's goals include maximum employment, a desire to see lower unemployment aligns with a dovish policy stance that supports easing monetary policy to boost economic activity and employment."
0,and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent"" indicates that inflation is moving toward the FOMC's target rate, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively steering inflation in the desired direction. This does not explicitly signal an immediate need for a policy shift either towards tightening or easing, as it describes a condition that is in line with the Committee's long-term inflation goal."
2,It also affects stock prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It also affects stock prices"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy (tightening or easing) or the Federal Reserve's stance on economic conditions such as employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral statement that simply acknowledges that monetary policy has an impact on stock prices without indicating whether the policy is intended to be more hawkish or dovish."
0,The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of the pandemic on the economy, noting its unprecedented nature and the resulting unemployment and economic shock. It does not directly indicate a future direction for monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides context for the economic environment in which the FOMC is operating. The statement is factual and does not suggest a particular policy response, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that both monetary and fiscal policies should be used to stimulate growth, suggesting an inclination towards an easing monetary policy stance to support economic expansion. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's objectives of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as stimulating growth typically involves measures that make monetary conditions more accommodative."
0,"Of course, we can’t do anything about long-run employment opportunities, but we can help the economy recover more quickly.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that while the FOMC cannot influence long-term employment directly, it can take action to support a faster economic recovery. This implies a willingness to implement or maintain accommodative monetary policy measures to stimulate economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish stance. Such measures often include keeping interest rates low to encourage borrowing and investment, which can help boost employment in the short term."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes maintaining low interest rates is suitable for the current economic conditions. This implies a preference for an easier monetary policy stance to support economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish approach that typically prioritizes stimulating growth and employment over combating inflation."
2,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economic problem being discussed is not directly related to monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's response to the pandemic. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a need to adjust monetary policy in response to this issue, as it falls outside the scope of their typical monetary policy tools. The stance is neither explicitly suggesting tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather acknowledging the presence of economic issues that are influenced by factors beyond the FOMC's control."
2,"We expect the economy will continue to perform well, with the job market strengthening further and inflation rising to 2 percent over the next couple of years.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a strengthening economy and job market, along with a rise in inflation to the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that the economy is performing well and approaching the dual mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In this context, the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation from rising above the target level, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to raise interest rates, which is a typical tool for tightening monetary policy. This action is generally taken to control inflation and stabilize prices, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices. The speaker's comfort with raising interest rates despite a large balance sheet suggests a focus on controlling inflation over stimulating the economy, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering international developments and the growth prospects of trade partners as part of their economic forecast, which suggests a comprehensive approach to policy-making. It does not explicitly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather demonstrates an awareness of external factors that could impact the domestic economy. This balanced consideration is in line with a neutral monetary policy stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction but rather reflects a careful assessment of various influences on the economic outlook."
0,"And, you know, we do want inflation to run moderately above 2 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the FOMC's target rate of 2 percent. This suggests that the Committee may be more tolerant of higher inflation in the short term, which could imply a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation persists above their target, in order to prevent it from becoming unanchored. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"If we don’t see the improvement that’s projected in the baseline outlook, that the June 18, 2014 opposite would be true and the pace of the timing and pace of interest rate increases would be Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL later and more gradual.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that if the projected economic improvements do not materialize, the Federal Reserve would consider delaying and slowing down the pace of interest rate hikes. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy rather than tightening it, in order to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond solely to monetary policy actions like adjusting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects a balanced view on the tools available for managing the economy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish position."
1,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the FOMC's commitment to delivering price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. The reference to price stability as a long-term benefit to society suggests a willingness to prioritize inflation control, potentially through tightening monetary policy if necessary, to maintain stable prices. This stance aligns with a hawkish view, where the focus is on preventing high inflation even if it requires increasing interest rates or other contractionary measures."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The speaker is emphasizing the focus on these two core objectives when setting interest rates, which does not inherently suggest an imminent policy change to either increase or decrease interest rates. The stance is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish direction."
0,"And if the stock theory of the portfolio is correct, which we believe it is, holding all of those securities off of the market and reinvesting and still keeping the, you know, rolling-over maturing securities, will still continue to put downward pressure on interest rates.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Federal Reserve's actions of holding securities and reinvesting in them, as well as rolling over maturing securities, are intended to maintain downward pressure on interest rates. Lower interest rates are typically associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as this approach aims to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, which can support employment and counteract low inflation. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if the economy is showing signs of slowing down or if inflation is below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
0,"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is willing to keep the target federal funds rate below what is considered normal for a longer period, even after employment and inflation levels approach the Committee's goals. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy, as the Committee is prepared to maintain lower interest rates to support the economic recovery. This dovish stance is aligned with promoting continued economic growth and employment, even at the risk of allowing inflation to run at or above their target level for some time."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence lists various factors that influence the economy and monetary policy decisions, such as interest rates, risk spreads, currency, the stock market, and credit availability. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. This reflects a balanced view without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of inflation on real income, which is a concern for the FOMC's mandate of stable prices. However, without additional context on the FOMC's stance on current inflation trends or policy adjustments, the sentence alone does not suggest a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance. It simply states a current economic condition related to their goals."
2,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the results of econometric models under idealized conditions, showing that optimal policy rules would keep inflation close to the 2% target. This statement does not explicitly indicate a current or future direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general goal of the FOMC to maintain price stability, which is consistent with their long-term inflation target. The mention of ""perfect certainty"" and ""perfect foresight"" as ""very unrealistic assumptions"" suggests a recognition of the limitations of models and the complexity of real-world economic policymaking, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states an observation that prices are rising from their lowest points, which could be part of a normal economic fluctuation. Without additional context on the speed of the price increases, their impact on the overall inflation rate, or the implications for monetary policy adjustments, it is not possible to classify this statement as either hawkish or dovish. It does not suggest immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of the current market conditions in the commercial real estate sector, where there is a recognition of high valuations coupled with a tightening of lending standards and less debt growth. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the financial stability in a specific market segment. It reflects a balanced view that acknowledges both the rise in asset prices and the mitigating factors of tighter lending standards and slower debt growth, which could be seen as precautionary measures to prevent financial imbalances."
0,"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a statistical adjustment to unemployment figures and does not directly indicate a policy action or stance. It reflects an analysis of labor market conditions, which is a key component of the FOMC's mandate, but it does not suggest whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a more accurate picture of the labor market, which the FOMC might use to inform future policy decisions."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering reviewing and potentially innovating its framework to better achieve its symmetric 2 percent inflation goal over time. This suggests a balanced approach to policy, focusing on adjustments that could either tighten or ease policy depending on the specific changes made to support the inflation target. It does not directly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing but rather a commitment to examining their approach to maintain their long-term inflation objective."
2,Same thing with economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Same thing with economic activity"" is too vague and lacks context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It does not provide specific information about the direction of economic activity, whether it is increasing, decreasing, or stable, nor does it indicate any particular action or outlook by the FOMC regarding monetary policy adjustments. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
