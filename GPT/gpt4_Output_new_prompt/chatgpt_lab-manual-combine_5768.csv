1,The information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity had turned up in the final quarter of last year and strengthened further since then.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that economic activity has been improving, which could indicate a growing economy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if economic activity is strengthening, it may lead to higher inflation or an overheating economy, which could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target. This could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to slow down economic growth to a sustainable level."
0,"To be sure, the prices of assets and the level of debt seem to reflect expectations of a benign economic environment--one in which policy will tighten only gradually, the economy will continue to strengthen and inflation will remain low, and the demand for houses and equities will remain solid.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current economic conditions are favorable and that there is an expectation of gradual policy tightening. This implies that the FOMC may be planning to increase interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain stable prices. The reference to a ""benign economic environment"" with strengthening economy and low inflation indicates that the FOMC is confident in the economy's trajectory and is prepared to adjust policy to keep it on track, which often involves tightening measures."
1,Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability for achieving maximum employment, which suggests a focus on controlling inflation. This could imply a willingness to tighten monetary policy to ensure inflation remains in check, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability even if it means potentially slowing down economic activity or employment growth in the short term."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants believe tightening monetary policy is appropriate, which typically means increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy. This is done with the intention of controlling inflation and bringing it down to the Committee's target level. The use of the term ""firming"" in the context of monetary policy stance usually refers to actions taken to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish approach."
0,"So for many, many years, we’ve been far from maximum employment and stable prices, and so the need for accommodative policy has been—has been clear.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there has been a prolonged period where the economy was not at maximum employment and stable prices, suggesting that there has been a need for an accommodative monetary policy, which typically means lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity. This stance is dovish as it favors easing rather than tightening."
2,"Several mentioned that the revisions to the NIPA pointed to a modest downward adjustment in projected growth of actual and potential GDP, but thought that potential output growth was likely to be a bit higher than forecast by the staff.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion about the revisions to the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) and their implications for GDP growth projections. It suggests a slight adjustment in the expectations for actual and potential GDP growth, but it does not directly imply an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of potential output growth being a bit higher than the staff's forecast could be seen as slightly optimistic, but without additional context on how this affects the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral. The focus is on assessing economic conditions rather than signaling a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"Accordingly, considerable caution needed to be exercised in assessing the outlook for productivity and in relying on projections of the economy and prices, which necessarily embodied judgments about this outlook, in making monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the need for caution in making monetary policy decisions based on projections that involve judgments about productivity and the economic outlook. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather indicates a careful and measured approach to policy-making in the face of uncertainty. This stance is consistent with a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish, as it reflects a focus on being responsive to incoming data and adjusting policy as needed to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the use of consensus estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and potential growth to inform the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) understanding of the economy's initial conditions and prospects. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment of economic conditions to guide policy decisions. The reference to ""what type of landing we should be aiming for"" suggests a focus on managing the economy towards a desired state, but it does not reveal whether this involves a more hawkish or dovish approach. The sentence is analytical and preparatory in nature, without a clear directional stance on policy adjustments."
0,"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that global economic growth is slowing down and there are disinflationary pressures, which could lead to lower inflation in the U.S. This suggests that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy, as the risks of overheating and high inflation appear to be reduced. The FOMC might consider easing policy to counteract these pressures and support its mandate of stable prices."
2,"For example, one—in the long-run, the size of the balance sheet is going to depend on the public’s demand for our liabilities, including currency and reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term determinants of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet size, which is influenced by the public's demand for its liabilities such as currency and reserves. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a factor that influences the central bank's operations. It reflects an understanding of how the balance sheet may adjust over time but does not signal an immediate policy action to either increase or decrease the money supply or interest rates."
2,"Share prices of financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in part, of concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions and concerns, specifically relating to financial firms' share prices, subprime mortgage exposure, and potential slowdowns in merger activity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic factors that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process."
2,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members focused on the disparate forces that continued to shape trends in economic activity, notably the persist- ence of considerable strength in private domestic spending and the damping influences stemming from foreign economic developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's discussion of economic conditions, highlighting both strong domestic spending and negative influences from abroad. It does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the different factors affecting the economy. This balanced view suggests a neutral stance, as the Committee appears to be weighing various elements without a bias toward action in either direction."
2,"So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been an improvement in employment conditions, with faster payroll expansion and a declining unemployment rate, yet it also acknowledges that unemployment is still higher than desired. This suggests a balanced view, recognizing positive developments in the labor market while also noting that there is room for improvement. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions relative to the employment aspect of the FOMC's mandate."
2,"Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation without directly indicating a future action or stance on monetary policy. It simply states that equity prices were higher with increased volatility, which does not inherently suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. This information could be used as part of the broader economic analysis that informs policy decisions, but on its own, it does not convey a clear policy direction."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants' forecasts for economic growth are stable, with no significant changes from previous projections. It suggests an expectation of a gradual strengthening in the recovery but does not explicitly signal a need for a change in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing. The stance is balanced, reflecting neither a particular concern about inflation nor about weak employment that would necessitate a clear dovish or hawkish response."
2,There is no evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite a strong labor market, there is no sign of increasing inflationary pressure due to rising costs associated with wages or employment. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to counteract inflation, as the strong labor market is not leading to the kind of inflation that would typically warrant such action. This dovish stance aligns with a policy that would support continued employment growth without the immediate need for interest rate hikes to combat inflation."
2,"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general statement about the Vice Chair's intention to discuss the relationship between financial markets and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather sets the stage for a discussion on how economic signals are integrated into policy decisions. The sentence reflects an intent to consider various sources of information, which is consistent with a balanced approach to policy-making."
2,The fundamental price of an asset typically is defined in terms of the discounted present value of the income stream or equivalent services that the asset is expected to provide over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical description of how the fundamental price of an asset is determined and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather explains a concept related to financial valuation. This statement does not reflect a change or proposed change in the FOMC's policy stance regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that wage trends are not contributing to inflationary pressure, which implies that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy. This dovish stance indicates a potential for maintaining or easing the current policy to support employment without risking the FOMC's inflation target."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. economic activity was revised upward, suggesting an improvement in economic conditions. This could imply that the economy is performing better than previously thought, potentially leading to higher inflation or overheating, which might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. A revision upward in economic projections can be associated with a hawkish stance if it signals that the economy is strong enough to handle interest rate increases or a reduction in monetary stimulus."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where GDP growth variance decreased and inflation rates fell from high levels. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past economic conditions, which could be used to inform current policy but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action."
2,"A few participants pointed to continued strong growth in multifamily construction, although the limited pipeline of new projects in one District suggested that activity could slow in 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations on the state of multifamily construction growth, with a mixed outlook suggesting potential slowing in one District. It does not directly indicate a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions that could inform future policy decisions. The focus on construction activity relates to economic growth and employment but does not explicitly tie to immediate policy action regarding interest rates or other monetary tools."
0,"More broadly, however, weaker demand, especially in sectors that have been most affected by the pandemic, has held down consumer prices, and overall, inflation is running well below our 2 percent longer-run objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer demand is weak, particularly in sectors hit hard by the pandemic, which has resulted in consumer prices being lower than expected. The statement also notes that inflation is currently below the FOMC's 2 percent long-term goal. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since the primary concern appears to be the risk of too-low inflation rather than the risk of too-high inflation. In this context, a dovish stance would be more likely to support monetary policy easing to stimulate demand and push inflation towards the target level."
2,"For example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to factories after the Civil War led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to operate the new machines.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical shift in the labor market demand due to changes in manufacturing production methods. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of tightening or easing. The sentence is more reflective of an economic observation from the past rather than a present monetary policy direction."
2,"So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So I think, through all of those channels, monetary policy works."" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply expresses a belief in the effectiveness of monetary policy through various channels. This statement does not provide information on whether the policy stance will be more hawkish or dovish, nor does it suggest any imminent changes to the policy. It is a general affirmation of the functionality of monetary policy without a clear directional bias."
0,"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a very low federal funds rate due to low rates of resource utilization and a subdued inflation outlook. This suggests that the FOMC is aiming to stimulate the economy by keeping borrowing costs low, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to encourage economic growth and employment. The mention of ""exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014"" further emphasizes the Committee's commitment to an accommodative policy over an extended period to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"Yet as research has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and corporate bonds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the limited explanatory power of economic fundamentals on asset prices, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of an observation on market behavior and does not suggest imminent policy actions to influence employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general understanding of the timing of the effects of monetary policy on the economy and financial markets without indicating a current or future direction of policy change. It acknowledges the lag between policy implementation and its impact on output and employment, while noting the immediate effect on financial markets, but does not suggest whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been rising, which is often a concern for the Federal Reserve. Higher inflation typically prompts the Fed to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The mention of higher prices for commodities and imported goods as drivers of inflation suggests that the Fed might be inclined to take a more hawkish stance to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing education and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. This is more of a structural issue rather than a direct monetary policy action. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights a long-term challenge that could affect economic productivity and growth. The FOMC recognizes the role of nonmonetary factors in achieving its goals, and this sentence reflects that broader perspective."
1,"With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal that we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis point hike would help do that.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tightening of monetary policy by suggesting a significant increase in the federal funds rate (a 50-basis point hike) to move back to a neutral policy stance. This action is in response to the economy being at full employment and inflation being far above the FOMC's target, which aligns with the goals of curbing inflation and maintaining stable prices."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a balanced approach to achieving the set goals."
2,"Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is an expectation of increased demand and business capital spending due to positive developments in the war against Iraq and a potential rally in the stock market. This anticipation of higher expenditures, particularly in high-tech equipment and software, could lead to economic expansion, which might put upward pressure on inflation. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. The mention of a ""favorable effect on business capital spending"" implies confidence in economic growth, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where stock prices have risen due to positive earnings reports and signs of economic stabilization. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather reports on market conditions and investor sentiment. It does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The rise in stock prices could be seen as a positive economic indicator, but without further context on inflation or employment, it does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail about their monetary policy tools rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. The setting of growth ranges for these aggregates is a part of the Committee's broader strategy to manage the money supply in pursuit of its objectives, but it does not inherently signal whether the Committee is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a commitment to previously established targets, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy stance at that time."
1,The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the projection for core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation has been increased due to higher recent inflation readings. This suggests a concern about higher inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"Even before the recent unfortunate developments in the Middle East, demand to augment buffer stocks surged, which has helped to keep prices high.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been an increase in demand to augment buffer stocks, which has contributed to keeping prices high. This suggests that inflationary pressures are present, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to high prices aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,The average rate of growth of CRE loans at banks continued to be strong in October and November.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports a fact about the growth rate of commercial real estate (CRE) loans, without providing a clear indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The statement is more of an observation of economic conditions rather than a signal of future policy actions."
0,"However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is merely an observation of economic activity, specifically in the housing finance sector, which could be influenced by various factors, including previous monetary policy decisions. This statement does not explicitly suggest a future direction for monetary policy but rather provides context on current economic conditions."
2,"Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U. S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on the factors that will influence the timing of economic growth, including containment measures and the success of various policies. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the role of both health-related measures and policy responses in determining economic recovery. The focus is on the uncertainty and the multifaceted nature of the economic situation, without a clear direction on monetary policy adjustments."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering innovations and changes to its framework that would support achieving its inflation target of 2% on a symmetric basis over time. This suggests a willingness to adapt policy to ensure that inflation does not persistently run below the target, which could imply a readiness to ease monetary policy if necessary to stimulate inflation towards the desired level. The use of ""more supportive"" implies actions that would help to boost inflation towards the target, which is typically associated with a dovish stance."
2,"In the absence of such a forward-looking response of long-term rates, short-term interest rates may have to move by more to achieve the same near-term impact on long-term interest rates and economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if long-term interest rates do not respond as expected to forward-looking indicators, short-term interest rates might need to be increased more aggressively to influence long-term rates and, consequently, economic activity. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy more than usual to achieve desired outcomes, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) could lead to higher interest rates for borrowers in other sectors compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. This concern implies a preference for a policy that might avoid further lowering interest rates in certain areas, which is a stance associated with tightening monetary policy or being less accommodative, hence hawkish."
1,Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that an active monetary policy addressing financial instability might lead to excessive risk-taking, which could increase the likelihood of future crises. This suggests a cautious stance towards easing policies, as it acknowledges the potential negative consequences of being too accommodative, which is in line with a tightening bias or a hawkish view. The focus is on preventing future instability, which may involve measures such as raising interest rates or other tightening actions to curb risk-taking behaviors."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an acceptance of inflation running moderately above the 2% target, which suggests that the FOMC is not inclined to take immediate action to tighten monetary policy in response to inflation slightly above their target. This stance is hawkish because it implies a tolerance for higher inflation and, therefore, a lesser likelihood of implementing easing measures. The FOMC's acceptance of moderately higher inflation could be seen as prioritizing other goals, such as supporting employment, over immediate inflation concerns."
0,"Long-term government bond yields declined and headline equity indexes increased, on net, in most of these countries, with bank stock prices in the euro area rising more than broader indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding bond yields and equity indexes, specifically mentioning the performance of bank stock prices in the euro area. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance or signal the FOMC's intentions to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of financial market conditions, which is part of the economic backdrop the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
0,"On the positive side, weakness in world demand for oil was fostering a significant downtrend in energy prices, albeit with adverse effects on energy producers in this country and abroad.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation with both positive and negative aspects: a decrease in energy prices due to weak global demand, which is beneficial for consumers but harmful for energy producers. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the mixed effects of economic conditions on different sectors, which is a neutral observation in the context of monetary policy stance."
1,"The expansion of M3 picked up over September and October, reflecting a strong acceleration in its non-M2 component that was associated with strong inflows to institutional money market funds and stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to meet credit demands.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a significant increase in the broad money supply (M3), particularly due to a rise in institutional money market funds and large time deposits. This could be interpreted as a sign of increased liquidity in the economy, which might lead to inflationary pressures if it outpaces economic growth. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if the Committee perceives this expansion as potentially inflationary, it might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overshoot of its long-term inflation target of 2%. Therefore, the sentence suggests a situation that could warrant a hawkish response to ensure price stability."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant decrease in core consumer price inflation, which suggests that inflationary pressures are diminishing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflation rate is moving away from the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. In response to lower inflation, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent deflationary risks, aligning with its mandate for stable prices."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) commitment to maintaining inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent target, which is consistent with their price stability mandate. It acknowledges the challenge of doing so, especially when the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate limits the Committee's ability to respond to downturns. This statement does not directly indicate a current or future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of managing inflation expectations within the existing policy framework. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the long-term inflation goal, without signaling a clear shift towards more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes both positive and negative economic impacts of a rise in oil prices, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. On one hand, it mentions the negative effect of lowering real household incomes and demand, which could suggest a dovish stance if the economy were to weaken significantly. On the other hand, it also notes the positive effect of increased investment in drilling and benefits to oil-producing areas, which could be seen as inflationary pressures that might warrant a hawkish response. However, since the sentence presents these effects as mixed and does not prioritize one over the other, it implies a balanced view that does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970sâ€”not a happy story.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the potential inflationary impact of oil price shocks, drawing a parallel with the 1970s when such shocks led to high inflation. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent a similar scenario, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve price stability and support sustainable economic growth, which are key aspects of its dual mandate (the third aspect being moderate long-term interest rates). It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather states the overall goals of the Committee. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"With regard to the federal sector, spending related to last year’s hurricanes appeared likely to abate, and federal expenditures overall would probably be providing less impetus to aggregate demand going forward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected decrease in federal spending due to the abatement of hurricane-related expenditures, which suggests a reduction in fiscal stimulus to the economy. This observation is a neutral statement regarding monetary policy as it does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It simply provides an assessment of the fiscal situation and its potential impact on aggregate demand, without suggesting a specific monetary policy response."
2,"The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the effectiveness and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further data. The focus on adjusting policy in response to changing economic conditions aligns with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,A number of participants indicated that the Committee should resume asset purchases only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants would consider resuming asset purchases only in the event of significantly adverse economic conditions that require more accommodation than can be achieved by merely lowering the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. This implies a stance where asset purchases are not currently being considered and will only be used as a last resort if conditions deteriorate significantly, indicating a preference for less aggressive monetary policy accommodation unless absolutely necessary. This stance leans towards tightening or at least not further easing monetary policy, which is considered hawkish."
2,"However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. Instead, it reflects a theoretical possibility that the central bank could change its approach to managing monetary policy by focusing on the quantity or growth of reserves rather than their price (interest rates). This statement is more about the methods of implementing policy rather than a clear direction of policy change. It does not provide information on whether such a shift would be used to stimulate the economy (dovish) or to restrain it (hawkish), nor does it suggest any imminent action that would affect employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,"In the view of a number of members, rapid growth of the monetary aggregates, though it had slowed very recently, was a further indication that financial conditions were not restraining economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members see the rapid growth of monetary aggregates as a sign that financial conditions are not limiting economic activity. This suggests a concern that the economy might be growing too quickly, potentially leading to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and maintain price stability."
0,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the FOMC's target of 2 percent for some time. This suggests that the Committee may be less inclined to take immediate action to tighten monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures, as they are tolerating a higher inflation rate temporarily. However, the stance is considered hawkish because it implies that the FOMC is anticipating future actions to counteract the inflation overshoot, which would likely involve tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the target level after it has been allowed to run higher. This forward-looking approach to managing inflation expectations can be seen as a preemptive tightening stance."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed correlation between the decline in term premiums and the decrease in long-run inflation uncertainty as well as short-term interest rate uncertainty since 1990. This statement is primarily analytical, reflecting on past trends without directly suggesting any immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on market conditions and factors that may influence the FOMC's decisions. The focus on historical correlation does not inherently signal a shift towards a hawkish or dovish policy stance."
1,"Looking ahead, some growth in overall consumer spending appeared likely in association with the now more firmly entrenched economic expansion.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests an expectation of growth in consumer spending due to a more stable economic expansion, which indicates neither a clear intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects a general positive outlook on the economy without specifying any particular monetary policy actions. The statement is balanced, acknowledging improvement in the economy, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not directly indicate a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has observed a slowdown in economic growth, which is partly attributed to a significant cooling in the housing market. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds, and the FOMC may consider easing monetary policy to support growth and prevent further slowdown, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices. A cooling housing market can lead to lower inflationary pressures and potentially impact employment in related sectors, which dovish policy measures could aim to mitigate."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities. This action is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. By providing support to private credit markets and economic activity, the FOMC is taking a dovish stance, which is associated with easing monetary policy to promote economic growth, especially when employment is below its maximum level or inflation is below the target rate."
0,"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is not only currently low but also expected to decrease slightly in the near future. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, given that inflation is not a pressing concern."
2,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of how inflation volatility affects nominal bond yields through the inflation risk premium, as estimated in a specific yield curve model. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a mechanism by which monetary policy might influence financial markets. The focus on inflation volatility and its impact on bond yields is consistent with the FOMC's mandate to maintain stable prices, but the sentence itself does not suggest any imminent policy action."
0,A few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe the market expects a more accommodative policy (i.e., lower interest rates) than they deem appropriate. They suggest that it might be necessary to realign market expectations with a less accommodative stance, which implies a potential tightening of monetary policy to ensure that the federal funds rate path aligns with the policymakers' views. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus might be on preventing inflation from rising above the target or on other concerns that warrant less monetary accommodation."
1,"I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the potential impact of a hypothetical situation (a sharp rise in the price of oil) on the U.S. economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of external economic factors that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC is acknowledging the importance of understanding how such a shock could affect their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate action or reaction in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Looking to the future, however, the members generally agreed that the risks were in the direction of a heightening in inflation pressures despite their belief that growth in overall demand now seemed to have declined to a more sustainable pace and probably would continue to expand for a time at a rate below that of the economy's output potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about the potential for increased inflation pressures in the future, despite a slowdown in demand growth to a more sustainable pace. This concern for rising inflation suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding their target level. The mention of risks tilted towards higher inflation aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies readiness to act against inflation, potentially through raising interest rates or other contractionary measures."
1,"Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has continued to rise, reaching a level of 9.1 percent, which is significantly above the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2 percent. This suggests that the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to its target level, in line with its commitment to stable prices. Tightening monetary policy could include actions such as raising the federal funds rate to cool down the economy and reduce inflationary pressures."
1,"At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the economy is performing in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable growth, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an expectation of continued economic stability, which does not by itself imply an immediate need for policy adjustment."
0,"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of labor market conditions, particularly focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor force participation of prime-age women and the distribution of job losses across industries. It does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy but rather discusses potential long-term economic consequences. The statement is descriptive of the current economic situation and does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring employment but does not in itself advocate for a specific monetary policy response."
0,Participants pointed to potential interactions between financial stresses and the housing market contraction as the primary source of continuing downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for downside risks to economic growth stemming from financial stresses and a contracting housing market. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to mitigate these risks and support growth, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating the economy over tightening monetary policy to combat inflation."
0,Most analysts would contend that U.S. interest rates were lowered by the world's accumulation of dollars.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that U.S. interest rates were previously reduced due to external factors, specifically the global accumulation of U.S. dollars. This suggests a past easing of monetary policy. However, the use of ""were lowered"" in a past tense and the context of most analysts contending this as a historical observation could indicate that this stance may no longer be in effect, potentially setting the stage for a shift towards a tighter monetary policy if the conditions that led to the lowering of interest rates have changed. Therefore, the sentence leans towards a HAWKISH stance, as it suggests a past action of easing that is being presented in a way that could imply readiness for a future tightening if warranted by economic conditions."
2,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it highlights a gap in data regarding the expectations of businesses and wages, which are important for understanding inflation dynamics. This reflects a neutral position, as it merely states a fact about the availability of information without suggesting a particular direction for policy action."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants anticipate further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, which is a tool for tightening monetary policy. The expectation of continued economic expansion and strong labor market conditions in conjunction with rate increases suggests a focus on preventing overheating and controlling inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the FOMC's inflation target and does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply describes a policy decision made in the past regarding the inflation target, which is a central part of the FOMC's long-term goals and strategy. The 2 percent inflation target is intended to help the FOMC achieve stable prices, which is one of its key mandates, but the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate policy action."
2,"I have downplayed the role of the U.S. federal budget deficit today, and I disagree with the view, sometimes heard, that balancing the federal budget by itself would largely defuse the current account issue.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the speaker's view regarding the relationship between the U.S. federal budget deficit and the current account issue, rather than directly addressing monetary policy actions such as interest rate adjustments or other measures that would influence employment, inflation, or interest rates. It neither implies a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather discusses fiscal policy and its perceived impact on broader economic concerns."
0,"So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant increase in the U-6 level of unemployment, which is a broader measure of labor underutilization that includes those who are underemployed and marginally attached to the labor force, in addition to the unemployed. A tripling of the U-6 rate suggests a severe deterioration in employment conditions. While this information alone does not directly indicate a tightening of monetary policy, the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment as one of its key goals would likely prompt a response to counteract such a negative trend. In the context of the FOMC's objectives, this could lead to an expansionary (dovish) policy stance to stimulate the economy and improve employment levels. However, without additional context on inflation and the broader economic situation, it is difficult to determine the exact policy response. If inflation were also high, the FOMC might lean towards a hawkish stance to control inflation, despite the high unemployment rate. Therefore, without further context, the classification could be seen as neutral or even dovish, depending on the broader economic conditions."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the slow growth of monetary aggregates (such as money supply) indicates that the current monetary policy is not too stimulative or loose. This suggests that there may be no need to ease policy further, and it could even hint at a bias towards tightening if economic conditions warrant, to prevent potential inflationary pressures or overheating of the economy. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors tighter monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
0,"A Framework for Analyzing the Growth of Labor ProductivityA great success story for the American economy has been the resurgence of productivity growth that began around 1995.1 From 1973 to 1995, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical context of labor productivity growth in the American economy but does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment concerns nor implies satisfaction with current economic conditions in a way that would suggest a change in policy. It is simply a statement of fact regarding past productivity growth."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical assumptions about productivity growth and labor force growth, which are factors that can influence monetary policy decisions. However, it does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more of a background statement on economic conditions rather than a clear signal of policy direction."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that an increase in the federal funds rate (by 50 or even 100 basis points) would not significantly dampen investor optimism regarding the profitability of emerging technologies. This implies that the speaker believes monetary policy tightening (higher interest rates) would not have the desired effect on cooling down what may be perceived as excessive optimism in financial markets. The stance is hawkish because it discusses the potential for raising interest rates, which is a tool typically used to tighten monetary policy in order to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating."
2,"In my comments today, I will focus on the Fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it emphasizes the Fed's commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability in the face of economic upheaval. The mention of learning from history and focusing on incoming data suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where decisions will be based on the evolving economic landscape and risks, rather than a predetermined path towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic observations and actions taken by the Bank of England rather than indicating a specific stance of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. It reports on the market reaction to inflation data and the Bank of England's assessment in the United Kingdom, which does not directly reflect the Federal Reserve's policy intentions or actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates in the United States."
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of credit conditions and loan growth in the commercial real estate sector without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that credit conditions have continued to ease and that there is solid growth in CRE loans, which does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy. This information could be used to assess economic conditions, but it does not in itself advocate for a particular policy stance."
2,"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing an intention to discuss findings and implications from a review in the context of the FOMC's goals and strategy. It does not directly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather a communication about policy framework and understanding, which is a neutral action in terms of policy stance."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance."" This suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring economic indicators and may be prepared to act, possibly by raising interest rates, to preempt inflationary pressures or other economic imbalances, in line with their goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""asymmetric directive"" implies that there is a greater likelihood of tightening than easing, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Furthermore, in the latest report, FOMC participants indicated that the current degree of uncertainty about GDP growth is even higher than the typical level of uncertainty over the past two decades.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' view on the uncertainty surrounding GDP growth, which in itself does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear policy direction. The statement acknowledges the challenges in forecasting and does not commit to any specific monetary policy action, thus it is considered neutral."
0,"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is committed to continuing its purchases of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace. This action is aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of the markets for these securities, which is essential for the effective transmission of monetary policy to the broader financial conditions. By maintaining or increasing the pace of asset purchases, the FOMC is providing additional monetary accommodation, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. This approach is often taken to stimulate the economy by keeping long-term interest rates low, supporting borrowing and spending, and thus helping to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Profit margins have been running a little higher this year than last, aided importantly by strong growth in labor productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that profit margins have increased due to strong growth in labor productivity, which is a positive economic indicator. However, it does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The statement is simply an observation of economic conditions, without a clear implication for immediate monetary policy adjustments. It reflects a balanced view that could be consistent with either maintaining the current policy stance or adjusting it in response to other economic developments."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the impact of policy measures (emergency unemployment insurance benefits) on labor force participation and the measured unemployment rate. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of how certain nonmonetary policies might affect labor market metrics, which are part of the broader economic considerations the FOMC takes into account when making decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about inflationary pressures resulting from excessive government spending financed by money creation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent the devaluation of nominal assets and to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish viewpoint. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to rising inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,Many participants noted that they expected household spending to be a primary contributor to economic growth going forward.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on economic growth driven by household spending but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. It reflects an expectation of economic conditions that could support the FOMC's goals but does not imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior; another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses academic research on behavioral finance and the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it references theoretical work that could inform policy decisions. The sentence does not provide information on the Committee's current assessment of the economy or its policy intentions, which are necessary to classify a statement as hawkish or dovish."
1,"If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the nature of oil price increases and their potential duration, which is a factor in assessing economic conditions but does not in itself suggest an immediate policy action. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but this sentence alone does not advocate for a specific monetary policy change."
2,"We are hopeful that Europe will take additional measures and do all that’s necessary to stabilize the situation and to provide the basis for an ongoing stable structure that—in which banks and sovereigns are both stabilized, in which there’s a program for growth, and in which fiscal arrangements are clear—are made much clearer.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a hope for stabilization and growth in Europe, focusing on the financial and fiscal structures there. It does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a general desire for economic stability and growth abroad, which can indirectly affect the U.S. economy and monetary policy decisions. However, the sentence itself does not provide clear guidance on the FOMC's future actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"Nonetheless, many participants expressed concern that ongoing developments in the housing market could have a more pronounced impact on consumer and other spending, especially if house prices declined significantly.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants are worried about potential negative effects on consumer spending due to issues in the housing market, particularly if house prices were to fall sharply. This concern suggests a focus on preventing economic downturns and maintaining stability, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to preempt inflationary pressures or financial imbalances that might arise from a troubled housing sector. The stance is therefore hawkish, as it implies a readiness to act against perceived risks to the economy's stability."
2,These participants preferred to wait until there was greater assurance that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy via financial markets and the supply of credit to households and businesses was working effectively.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for caution and ensuring that the monetary policy transmission mechanism is functioning properly before taking further action. This suggests a stance towards maintaining or easing the current policy rather than tightening it, as there is a focus on wanting to see the effects of policy on credit supply and financial markets, which aligns with a dovish approach to support economic activity and growth."
2,"While participants viewed the downside risks to their forecasts of economic activity over the projection period as having diminished, their assessment of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the projection period was not greatly changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC participants see a reduction in downside risks to economic activity, their overall expectations for economic activity and inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests a steady outlook without a clear indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The stance is balanced, reflecting neither a clear intent to adjust policy in response to improved economic conditions (hawkish) nor a need to provide additional support (dovish)."
1,Our Congressional mandate is to achieve full employment and price stability in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply restates the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of achieving full employment and price stability, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered a neutral statement."
1,"We have Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL households who are becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and more able to service that debt, an improving job market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic condition, with households becoming more comfortable with their debt levels and an improving job market. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic situation. It suggests that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not explicitly state an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard against the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain above 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more challenging to bring inflation back down to our target.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation expectations becoming entrenched above the 2% target, which suggests that the FOMC might take a more aggressive stance to tighten monetary policy in order to prevent a self-fulfilling rise in inflation. This aligns with a hawkish approach, where the priority is to control inflation even if it means potentially slowing down the economy."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad objectives that guide the Committee's actions."
2,"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the relationship between equity price movements and investment spending, which is more of an analytical question rather than a direct statement on monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of economic factors that could influence the FOMC's decision-making."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is currently low and any increase in inflationary pressures is expected to rise slowly. Additionally, it notes that the strength in demand is occurring in a context where financial conditions have not changed significantly. This implies that there is no immediate concern for inflation to rise quickly, which would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is dovish, indicating that there is no pressing need to increase interest rates to combat inflation, and the FOMC might be more inclined to maintain or ease the monetary policy to support demand."
2,"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence explicitly states that the technical measures being discussed do not equate to a change in the stance of monetary policy. The continuation of implementing policy through adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate indicates a steady approach, without signaling a shift towards either tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced or status quo position in line with their ongoing policy strategy."
2,But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's views on inflation, employment, or interest rates, nor does it suggest a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence could be interpreted as a general statement on the challenges of economic adjustments and does not reflect a clear monetary policy stance."
1,"There were more reports that rising wages and benefits and increasing costs of nonlabor inputs could no longer be fully offset by improvements in productivity, and more business firms appeared to be attempting or considering increases in their selling prices to maintain or improve their profit margins.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising wages and input costs that are outpacing productivity gains, leading to attempts by businesses to raise selling prices to preserve profit margins. This scenario suggests upward pressure on inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current monetary policy settings are considered appropriate for the economic growth and inflation forecasts provided by the members. It suggests that the existing policy stance is aligned with the FOMC's expectations for achieving its goals, without signaling a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The use of the word ""readily"" implies comfort with the current policy in relation to the expected economic conditions, which is a neutral position."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perspective on the unemployment rate is one of equilibrium, with no particular skew towards either an overly tight or overly loose labor market. This suggests that the current policy stance is neither particularly geared towards tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish), but rather is maintaining a steady course aimed at preserving the existing state of employment. It reflects a balanced view without signaling a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been growing above trend for three years, which has substantially reduced economic slack. This implies that the economy might be operating near or at its full capacity, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad objectives that guide the Committee's actions."
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members perceive significant risks to the economic outlook and believe that lowering interest rates would serve as a precaution against potential economic downturns. This stance suggests a move towards easing monetary policy to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish approach. The decision to reduce rates is typically taken to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper, thereby encouraging investment and consumption, which can help in achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices when the economy is perceived to be at risk."
2,"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strong commitment to achieving price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By stating that price stability is ""fully under the control of monetary policymakers,"" it suggests that the FOMC is willing to take action, potentially including tightening monetary policy, to ensure that inflation remains in check. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which prioritizes combating inflation and may involve raising interest rates or other measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a consideration of strategies that might involve taking action to correct for previous periods where inflation did not meet the target, which could suggest a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back to the desired level. This reflects a proactive stance on inflation management, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy approach."
2,The demand for commercial paper declined as prime money market mutual funds experienced large net outflows after the net asset value of one such fund fell below $1 per share.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the financial markets where there is a decline in the demand for commercial paper due to outflows from prime money market mutual funds after a drop in the net asset value of one fund. This statement is more of an observation of market conditions rather than an indication of a future policy stance. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on financial stability concerns that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions."
1,"As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nationâ€™s underlying productive capacity.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that to achieve a sustainable and non-inflationary economic expansion, there may be a need to slow down the growth of economic activity. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The reference to moderation in growth indicates a willingness to potentially raise interest rates or take other measures to align economic growth with the long-term productive capacity of the nation, which is a hawkish stance."
0,"On balance over the intermeeting period, interest rates on private instruments registered small mixed changes while yields on longer-term Treasury securities declined significantly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observed changes in interest rates and yields without explicitly indicating a future policy action or a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy. It simply reports financial market conditions, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, not necessarily the FOMC's policy decisions. The decline in longer-term Treasury yields could be interpreted in multiple ways, and without additional context, it does not clearly suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about persistent inflationary pressures stemming from rising healthcare, insurance, and oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these pressures and maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to prevent inflation from staying above the target level."
0,And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.,"HAWKISH

The sentence reflects on the high costs of achieving low inflation in the past, which involved significant tightening of monetary policy through high interest rates and the resulting high unemployment. This historical context suggests a willingness to endure short-term economic pain for the long-term goal of stable prices, indicating a hawkish stance that prioritizes inflation control, potentially at the expense of higher employment in the short term."
2,So the Committee estimates that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an estimate of the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's assessment of the natural rate of unemployment that is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment, but it does not suggest any immediate policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
2,"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the importance of providing projections to help the public understand the difference between short-term price shocks and longer-term inflation trends, which is a part of the FOMC's commitment to transparency. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather focuses on the communication aspect of policy to aid in public planning. This is consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, without suggesting a specific policy action."
1,"The unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the April and June meetings, but payroll employment posted solid gains, and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite the unemployment rate remaining unchanged, there have been solid gains in payroll employment and an overall improvement in the utilization of labor resources. This suggests a strengthening labor market, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Price and capital controls, which might have been feasible a half century ago, would be very difficult to implement in today's more technologically advanced environment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the feasibility of certain economic interventions in the current technological context, without suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It neither implies a need to raise interest rates (hawkish) nor suggests easing (dovish), but rather comments on the practicality of specific controls in the modern economy."
2,"November 01, 2006 Community Development Financial Institutions: Promoting Economic Growth and Opportunity Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the Opportunity Finance Networkâ€™s Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. Share Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to your annual conference.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a formal greeting and does not provide any information regarding monetary policy stance, adjustments to the federal funds rate, or specific commentary on economic conditions such as employment, inflation, or interest rates. It does not indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants expect certain inflationary pressures (energy prices and rents) to stabilize or decelerate in the future. This expectation does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to a wait-and-see approach, where the Committee is monitoring these factors as part of their assessment. The statement reflects a balanced view on inflation—one of the key concerns of the FOMC—without signaling a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation"" is a statement of economic principle rather than a direct indication of policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need to ease policy due to low inflation pressures (which would be dovish). Instead, it provides a neutral observation that economic growth and inflation are not directly causative, which is consistent with the understanding that multiple factors influence inflation beyond growth rates."
1,"The first is what to do about supply shocks, like large increases in oil prices, which tend to increase both inflation and unemployment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario of supply shocks, such as significant increases in oil prices, which can lead to higher inflation and unemployment. This statement is simply acknowledging a type of economic disturbance that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing), but rather the complexity of responding to dual economic pressures that affect both inflation and employment. The FOMC's response to such a scenario would depend on the broader economic context and its impact on their long-term goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,The Federal Reserve has a dual mandate from the Congress to pursue policies that aim to achieve and sustain maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states the Federal Reserve's dual mandate as set by Congress, which is to aim for maximum employment and price stability. It does not provide any specific direction on the current or future stance of monetary policy, nor does it indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a factual statement about the objectives of the Federal Reserve and does not reflect a change or a proposed change in policy."
2,It was the year of synchronized global growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It was the year of synchronized global growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a descriptive statement about the state of the global economy, without any explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. It does not provide information on inflation, employment, or interest rates, which are the key factors the FOMC considers when determining its policy stance."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of how interest rate changes impact various economic factors such as asset prices, household wealth, exchange rates, net exports, and import prices. It also compares the effects of short-term rate changes with balance sheet policies, noting that the influence of the federal funds rate is better understood due to extensive historical data. This statement does not explicitly indicate a direction for future monetary policy but rather describes the mechanisms through which monetary policy operates. It reflects an understanding of the tools at the FOMC's disposal and the effects of their use, without suggesting an imminent policy shift toward either tightening or easing."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of the housing market, noting improvements in activity and a rise in house prices, but also acknowledges variability across regions. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It is simply reporting on economic conditions, which is a neutral activity in terms of policy stance."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC believed its current monetary policy stance was appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects at the time of their meeting. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the existing policy settings in relation to the economic outlook. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
1,"Nevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could deviate from the target path, which is considered a significant risk to the economic outlook. This concern about inflation suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent or counteract higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures."
2,"It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the effects of changes in longer-term interest rates on emerging markets, particularly in relation to capital flows and exchange rate pegs. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the potential impact of U.S. monetary policy on other economies. This statement is more about the observation of economic dynamics than a hint at future policy actions."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining a low federal funds rate until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a return to the 2% inflation target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed 2% for some time. This approach is aimed at supporting economic recovery and ensuring that inflation and employment goals are sustainably achieved before considering policy tightening."
1,"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that delaying the adjustment towards the neutral interest rate could lead to negative outcomes such as excessive inflation or financial instability. This implies a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy sooner rather than later to prevent such risks, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand. This action would be in line with their goal of maintaining stable prices, and a tightening policy is typically considered hawkish."
2,"This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflective statement on historical events rather than a current policy stance or future outlook. It does not provide any specific information on the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing, nor does it directly address the current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement regarding the U.S. current account deficit and the trade balance, specifically the difference between the value of imports and exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on the economic conditions that might influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus on the current account deficit does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions but rather serves as an economic indicator that the Committee might consider in its comprehensive assessment of the economy."
2,Our tools work on demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Our tools work on demand"" is a general statement about the effectiveness of the FOMC's monetary policy tools in influencing economic demand. It does not explicitly indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather affirms the capability of their tools to affect the economy. This statement could be seen as a foundational belief in the efficacy of their policy measures, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"I think the—you know, in a way, the least tight aspect of it is, is looking at the unemployment rate, which is still below our median estimate of, of [the unemployment rate consistent with] maximum employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current unemployment rate is below what the FOMC estimates to be consistent with maximum employment. This could indicate that the labor market is tight, which may lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In Japan, private consumption rebounded strongly, and private investment and net exports continued to boost growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in Japan, specifically noting positive trends in private consumption, private investment, and net exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments or signal the Federal Reserve's intentions to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on international economic developments, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC when making policy decisions. However, without a clear connection to the FOMC's policy actions or goals, the sentence remains neutral."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where interest rates are rising quickly, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The concern about not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve is anticipating the consequences of a higher interest rate environment, which could be due to efforts to control inflation or other economic factors that warrant a more hawkish stance. The mention of potential problems with congressional response indicates an awareness of the broader implications of such a policy move."
2,"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment. It suggests that the Fed does not prioritize one goal over the other and aims to be ""evenhanded"" in its policy decisions, which implies a neutral stance rather than a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is taking steps to reduce its balance sheet at a faster pace than in the previous cycle, in addition to increasing the policy rate. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as it is aimed at reducing liquidity in the financial system to help balance demand with supply, which is typically done to combat inflation or prevent an overheating economy. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary stance."
1,"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to adjust policy to control inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy measures such as raising interest rates. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing high inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
2,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in the growth of the money supply (M2 and M3), which is often associated with a tightening of monetary policy. By moderating the growth of the money supply, the FOMC may be aiming to control inflation, which aligns with its goal of stable prices. This action can be seen as a preventive measure to avoid an overheating economy, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"About the same time, Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model, based on M2, which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the development of a model (P-star) that is used to predict long-run inflation trends based on the quantity theory of money and other economic variables. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a tool for understanding inflation dynamics. The model itself is a neutral analytical tool that helps inform policy decisions but does not inherently suggest a policy direction."
0,"Two changes have particular relevance for the employment leg of the dual mandate.15 The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in the Federal Reserve's approach to employment, where the focus is now on eliminating shortfalls of employment rather than also minimizing deviations when employment is too high. This suggests a more accommodative stance, aiming to support maximum employment and potentially allowing for a more lenient view on inflation, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy that is more focused on stimulating economic growth and less on tightening to prevent high inflation."
2,An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected change in the pace of inventory accumulation, which would affect domestic production levels. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses economic conditions related to production and sales. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions that the FOMC would consider in its balanced approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an observation about productivity growth in other advanced countries compared to the United States, without directly indicating a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy based on the productivity growth comparison. Instead, it provides context on economic performance that may be considered when making future policy decisions."
2,The staff's forecast for inflation was basically unchanged from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's inflation forecast has not changed since the previous FOMC meeting, suggesting that there has been no significant shift in the economic outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent action to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is best classified as neutral."
1,It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is robust enough to withstand a tightening of monetary policy, which typically involves increasing interest rates to control inflation. This implies a readiness to implement measures that would prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes curbing inflation and maintaining price stability, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of assessment and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that FOMC participants submitted their economic projections under their own judgments of appropriate monetary policy, without suggesting whether the policy should be tightened, eased, or remain the same."
2,Surveys indicated that households’ expectations of inflation over the next year were little changed in February while households’ and professional forecasters’ longer-term inflation expectations edged lower.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests that short-term expectations are stable and that there is a slight decline in long-term expectations, which could be seen as a balanced view not necessarily warranting immediate policy action. The FOMC might interpret stable short-term expectations as a sign that current policy is effective, while the decline in long-term expectations could be reassuring for the inflation outlook, but neither point clearly suggests a need for a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, which suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent such an outcome. This stance is consistent with a focus on price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. The emphasis on preventing a concerning rise in inflation expectations indicates a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish position."
0,Participants expected economic activity to contract sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in early 2009.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of economic contraction, which typically leads to a dovish monetary policy stance. In anticipation of a slowdown, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and counteract the expected decline, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,The Role of Government Policy You will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it references the role of government policy in influencing productivity growth, which is a factor that can affect the economy but is separate from the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve. The sentence neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment nor provides insight into the Committee's future actions regarding interest rates or other monetary tools."
2,"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the valuation of equity markets and the expectations of future returns, rather than directly commenting on monetary policy actions such as interest rate adjustments or other measures that the Federal Reserve might take to influence economic conditions. It does not indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of market sentiment and valuation, which can be one of many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The focus on market expectations does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustments."
0,But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the target level of 2 percent. This suggests that if inflation is currently below the target, the FOMC is willing to adopt measures that could increase inflation, which may involve loosening monetary policy in the short term. However, the commitment to a specific inflation target also implies that if inflation were to rise above this level, the FOMC would likely take a tightening stance to bring inflation back down to the target, which is generally considered a hawkish policy move. The emphasis on a commitment to a specific inflation target suggests a readiness to adjust policy to maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC's action was a response to increased concerns and uncertainty due to recent terrorist attacks, which could negatively impact asset prices and economic performance. This suggests that the FOMC may be leaning towards easing monetary policy to counteract the potential adverse effects on the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity in times of uncertainty and stress."
1,"The real federal funds rate probably was not greatly out of line with its appropriate level, and the rise in longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate meant that financial conditions were now exerting more restraint than earlier this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is aligned with its target level, suggesting that the current monetary policy is appropriate. Additionally, the mention of rising longer-term interest rates and the exchange rate leading to more restraint in financial conditions implies a tightening of monetary policy. This tightening aligns with a hawkish stance, as it suggests measures are in place to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with the goals of controlling inflation and maintaining stable prices."
0,Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where an investment boom led to rapid growth in labor productivity. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on economic performance, which is a neutral statement in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,"It was observed that, after the early 1980s, the pass-through of energy prices into core inflation had been quite limited, suggesting that, in current circumstances, core inflation could stay relatively low and overall inflation would probably drop back if inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the impact of energy prices on core inflation has historically been limited and implies that core inflation might remain low, with overall inflation likely to decrease if inflation expectations stay under control. This indicates a scenario where there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current policy to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"The bottom line is that past performance, in several important dimensions, has been extraordinary and that prospects look favorable for continued expansion and relatively low inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on the economy, with expectations for continued expansion and relatively low inflation. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check. The reference to ""extraordinary"" past performance and ""favorable"" prospects implies confidence in the economy's strength, which is often associated with a hawkish stance, as it may not require further monetary stimulus and could even warrant an increase in interest rates to maintain price stability."
0,"As a result, the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities fell.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that investors are anticipating a more rapid and significant easing of monetary policy, which is typically associated with lower interest rates. The decline in yields on both nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities further suggests that the market is expecting a dovish shift, which would be in line with a policy aimed at stimulating the economy, possibly in response to lower inflation expectations or concerns about economic growth. This aligns with a dovish stance, which involves easing monetary policy to support employment and counteract below-target inflation."
0,"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion among FOMC participants about credit spreads and the associated risks, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It acknowledges potential future risks to both aggregate demand and financial stability, which could warrant either tightening or easing, depending on how these risks materialize. However, the sentence itself does not commit to any specific monetary policy action, thus it is considered neutral."
2,"Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probability distributions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of risk measurement and management, specifically the use of historical market price fluctuations and probability distributions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on how risk is assessed, which is a factor that can inform monetary policy decisions but does not in itself represent a policy stance."
2,But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the resilience of exchange rates that are supported by compatible policies and cost structures, without directly indicating a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor provides insight into the FOMC's future monetary policy decisions. Instead, it reflects a general observation about the stability of exchange rates in the face of speculation, which is not directly related to the immediate goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"On the supply side, the effect is fairly clear and immediate: An increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace of growth of the economy's productive capacity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between trend productivity growth and the economy's productive capacity, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It is a statement of economic principle rather than a signal of an immediate policy stance. The FOMC might consider this information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not indicate whether the Committee would respond with tighter or looser monetary policy."
1,"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that current inflationary pressures are temporary and will subside once supply bottlenecks are resolved, but it also acknowledges uncertainty about the timing. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, which does not clearly signal an immediate intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. The stance is balanced, reflecting the FOMC's commitment to adjusting policy in response to economic conditions but without committing to a specific direction at this time."
1,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is becoming more widespread, particularly in the services sector. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not confined to specific areas and may be becoming more entrenched, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. A broad spread of inflation typically prompts central banks to consider measures to cool down the economy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strategy that would involve tightening monetary policy once certain economic conditions are met, specifically the achievement of employment and inflation objectives. The mention of ""liftoff"" in conjunction with yield curve caps suggests a planned increase in interest rates (liftoff from the current low or zero rates) and a control of longer-term interest rates, which are both actions associated with a more hawkish stance. This approach is consistent with a move towards tightening when the economy is showing signs of reaching the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,Survey and market measures of long-term inflation expectations did not suggest that the earlier higher inflation readings were going to persist.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that long-term inflation expectations remain stable despite previous higher inflation readings, suggesting that there is no need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to combat persistent inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies that the FOMC may not see the need to increase interest rates significantly if inflation is not expected to remain high."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing unemployment and mitigating the long-term negative effects of extended joblessness. This suggests a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job creation and economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish stance. The emphasis on bringing people back to work aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, and a dovish policy would typically involve lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. This sentence does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects the market's interpretation of external communications and data. It suggests a change in investor expectations but does not provide information on the actual stance of the FOMC."
0,"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply explains the importance of the goal of maximizing employment without indicating a direction for monetary policy change. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms one of the FOMC's core objectives."
0,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects inflation to decrease as the economy's true state becomes clearer and as certain processes unfold. This suggests that the FOMC may not see an immediate need to tighten monetary policy aggressively if they anticipate inflation will decline on its own. The stance is therefore dovish, as it hints at a less urgent need for measures to combat high inflation, aligning with a policy that would support easing rather than tightening."
1,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee recognizes the presence of ongoing inflation risks. This acknowledgment suggests that the FOMC may be inclined to continue or implement measures to tighten monetary policy in order to address and mitigate these inflationary pressures, aligning with their goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that certain measures of inflation (trimmed price indexes) are aligning closely with the FOMC's long-term inflation goal of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is under control and may not require further easing of monetary policy. In fact, if inflation is stable at the target rate, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing what multifactor productivity encompasses, which includes various factors that affect output per hour beyond just capital investment. This is a factual statement about economic productivity and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the current economic conditions in terms of employment, inflation, or interest rates that would suggest a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the approaches to monetary policymaking, noting a trend in the reliance on forecast-based methods over other approaches. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the methodology used by central banks in their decision-making process. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a positive trend in the unemployment rate but also expresses caution by noting that this improvement might be overstated due to a decline in labor force participation. This suggests a balanced view, recognizing progress in employment but also indicating that the labor market might not be as strong as the unemployment rate alone would suggest. It does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather suggests ongoing assessment and vigilance."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent need to adjust the federal funds rate due to the presence of uncertainties and muted inflation pressures. The use of the word ""patient"" suggests that they are in no rush to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment, especially when inflation is not a concern."
0,"Moreover, the resulting robust gains in labor productivity have been well ahead of compensation growth and have dramatically boosted corporate profits.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that labor productivity has increased significantly without a corresponding rise in compensation, leading to a substantial increase in corporate profits. This scenario suggests that the economy might be operating efficiently with low inflationary pressure from wages, which could provide room for the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and ensure price stability, one of its key goals. The robust gains in productivity without wage inflation could be seen as a sign of a strong economy that might not require further monetary stimulus, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth, the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that productivity is growing faster than expected, which can alleviate inflationary pressures by increasing supply. Additionally, stable world economic conditions are expected to keep energy prices in check, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations indicates that inflation may not be a pressing concern. These factors combined suggest that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy or maintain the current policy without further tightening."
0,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects an observation about economic conditions, specifically mentioning a slowdown in productivity and its impact on growth, without directly suggesting an imminent change in monetary policy. It indicates that the FOMC is aware of the factors affecting the economy but does not imply a clear direction for tightening or easing policy. The focus on productivity and growth relates to the FOMC's mandate for maximum employment and stable prices, as productivity can influence both, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between inflation expectations and actual inflation, suggesting that if expected inflation increases only slightly, actual inflation will also increase marginally. This statement does not directly indicate a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains a dynamic that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. It reflects an understanding of how expectations can influence economic outcomes, which is a factor the FOMC would monitor in its efforts to maintain price stability."
0,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow; in contrast, however, overall business investment in equipment and software was projected to strengthen in response to the upward trend in replacement demand, especially for computers and software; also, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of U. S. exports for some period ahead.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations for various sectors of the economy, with a slowdown in consumer durables and housing spending, but an increase in business investment and export growth due to solid economic growth abroad. This mixed outlook does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of different economic factors that the FOMC might consider in their policy decisions. The sentence reflects a balanced view of the economic situation, with both positive and negative aspects, which is why it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"This approach adds to what we have learned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditionsâ€”most notably, long-term sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3 Empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also challenging, as the report readily acknowledges.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the assessment of unconventional policy tools and their impact on various financial conditions, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy. It reflects a focus on understanding the effectiveness of past actions rather than signaling an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,The evidence suggests that new technology often results in more growth in employment in innovating industries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation regarding the impact of new technology on employment growth in innovating industries. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an assessment of how technological advancements might influence employment, which is one aspect of the broader economic environment the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
2,Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the current rate of wage inflation, which is aligned with the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2%. Without additional context suggesting that this rate of wage inflation is either too high or too low relative to the current economic conditions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic situation, highlighting both a weak manufacturing sector and growth in the services sector, which has positive outcomes such as low unemployment, good job creation, and rising wages. This description does not explicitly indicate a direction for a change in monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of different sectors in the economy. The positive aspects could suggest a healthy economy that does not require immediate policy intervention, while the mention of weak manufacturing could imply caution. Overall, the sentence seems to present a balanced view without a clear bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,Factors pointing to potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and relatively low grain supplies.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential inflationary pressures due to increased food prices and low grain supplies. This suggests a risk of higher inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overshoot of their long-term inflation target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a confidence in the current policy framework's ability to handle economic challenges, suggesting that the FOMC believes its existing strategy is appropriate for the current economic conditions. This statement is more about the adequacy of their policy tools and approach rather than a signal of imminent policy action."
1,"Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve's efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's policy framework in achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability over the past eight years, up until the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of past performance. The mention of the longest economic expansion suggests that the policies were effective in maintaining the dual mandate, but it does not signal a future policy direction."
2,"It is not a Taylor rule but it has the same feature that it relates policy to observables in the economy, such as unemployment and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a methodological approach to monetary policy that involves adjusting policy based on observable economic indicators like unemployment and inflation. It does not indicate a specific direction (tightening or easing) of policy change but rather describes a systematic way of responding to economic conditions. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to adjusting policy as necessary to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"The recent decline in the dollar was another factor that could add to inflation pressures, although the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that a recent decline in the dollar could contribute to increased inflation pressures. This suggests a concern about rising inflation, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these pressures and maintain their inflation target. The mention of the dollar's decline as a factor that could add to inflation implies vigilance over potential inflationary effects, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
1,"Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while unemployment is very low, which could suggest a tight labor market and potential inflationary pressures, the rise in wages is in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. This balance suggests that the current situation is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation that would warrant a tightening of policy (hawkish), nor showing signs of economic weakness that would require a loosening of policy (dovish). The statement reflects a situation where the FOMC might not feel compelled to adjust monetary policy aggressively in either direction, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
0,"Participants agreed that the path of the economy would depend significantly on the course of the virus and that the ongoing public health crisis would continue to weigh on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants recognize the negative impact of the public health crisis on economic activity, employment, and inflation. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy during the crisis, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on the adverse effects of the virus implies a readiness to ease policy to counteract these effects, rather than tighten it."
0,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has decided to reduce interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy easing. Lowering interest rates is typically done to stimulate economic activity, support employment, and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's target. This action aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests a move towards more accommodative monetary policy to support the economy."
2,"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the economic growth and emerging problems in Asian economies without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather provides context or background information that may be considered when making policy decisions."
1,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if a certain condition persists, it will facilitate the process of restoring price stability, which is one of the FOMC's key goals. Restoring price stability often involves measures to reduce inflation, which can include tightening monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence suggests a stance that is more inclined towards taking action to control inflation, which is considered hawkish."
2,"Moreover, a change in the ranges might be misinterpreted as a signal of greater reliance on the broad monetary aggregates in the formulation and conduct of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about potential misinterpretation of policy signals rather than directly indicating a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's focus on clear communication and transparency regarding its policy decisions and the tools it uses, without suggesting a specific direction for future policy."
2,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context and explains the rationale behind the FOMC's structure, focusing on the benefits of a committee approach in terms of information aggregation and diversity of perspectives. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide specific information on current economic conditions or policy adjustments. Therefore, it is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
0,"Now, we’ve long expected, as most analysts have, to see some slowing in Chinese growth over time as they rebalance their economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general observation about economic trends in China and does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather acknowledges an external economic development. The FOMC's focus is on U.S. economic conditions, and while international developments can impact their decisions, this statement does not provide insight into the Committee's leanings towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat consumer confidence, the fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where household spending growth has moderated, which could be a sign of a cooling economy, but it also acknowledges the strength in the job market, rising incomes, and high consumer confidence, which are positive indicators. This balance of both a slight negative and positive outlook does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather supports a steady approach, maintaining the current policy stance until clearer trends emerge."
1,"Our role, though, is also to, you know, to make sure that—that maximum employment happens in a context of price stability and financial stability, which is why we’re gradually raising rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is in the process of raising interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. The goal of such action is typically to manage inflation and maintain price stability, which aligns with the FOMC's mandate. The use of the word ""gradually"" suggests a cautious approach to tightening, but it is still indicative of a hawkish stance as the direction is towards increasing rates."
2,"For the twelve months ended in September, prices of consumer items other than food and energy increased by a considerably smaller amount than in the year- earlier period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the inflation rate for consumer items, excluding food and energy, has slowed down compared to the previous year. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could be seen as a sign that the Committee might not need to be as aggressive in raising interest rates, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity would slow in coming quarters to a pace somewhat above that of the economy's estimated potential and would moderate a bit further in 1998.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a forecast where economic activity is expected to slow but remain above the economy's estimated potential, suggesting a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It implies that the economy is growing at a healthy pace, which does not necessitate an immediate policy response."
2,"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of the challenges faced by monetary policymakers in emerging economies, which does not directly indicate a stance on the FOMC's monetary policy in the United States. It is a general statement about the global economic environment rather than a comment on the FOMC's policy intentions."
1,"In this regard, members referred to earlier unsustainable rates of investment by many high-tech firms that were now obliged to retrench despite still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where high-tech firms are experiencing high demand but are also undergoing a period of retrenchment from previously unsustainable investment rates. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions, particularly in the high-tech sector, without suggesting an immediate need for the FOMC to adjust its policy stance in response to these conditions. It is a neutral observation that acknowledges the dynamics within a specific industry, which may be one of many factors the FOMC considers when evaluating the overall economic landscape."
0,"The housing sector has fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current state of the housing sector and attributes part of its recovery to low mortgage interest rates. It does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of the economic conditions related to the FOMC's goals. The recovery of the housing sector is consistent with the goal of maximum employment, while low mortgage interest rates have been part of the accommodative policy to support the economy. However, the sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC plans to adjust rates to either continue supporting the sector or to counteract potential overheating, making the stance neutral."
2,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's effort to find a point of balance between supply and demand, which is a conceptual and analytical approach to understanding inflation dynamics. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a neutral stance focused on assessing economic conditions. The mention of seeking a balance suggests a commitment to the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment without signaling a clear move towards either more aggressive or more accommodative policy actions."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a willingness to adjust interest rates swiftly in response to changing economic conditions. This suggests a proactive approach to managing inflation and economic stability, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance. Quick adjustments to interest rates often mean tightening monetary policy to curb inflation or prevent an overheated economy, aligning with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation stating that after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), it took a significant amount of time for employment and inflation to stabilize and align with the Federal Reserve's mandates. This statement does not directly indicate a future policy action or a current policy stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reflects on past events and the time it took for the economy to recover to levels consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Shortly after 9 a.m. each morning, the Desk staff and staff members at the Board of Governors confer over the phone to discuss their respective estimates of the day's demand for balances as well as to consider factors that may affect supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine operational procedure regarding the daily assessment of demand and supply for balances by the Desk staff and the Board of Governors. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is simply a statement of process and does not reflect a policy position."
1,They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members recognize additional inflationary pressures arising from the war and related events, which suggests a concern for rising inflation. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The mention of these pressures also implies a readiness to act to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
0,"Inflation readings available since the April meeting continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and continued decreases in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is running below the Committee's target, which suggests there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to raise inflation towards the desired level. The mention of declines in energy prices and non-energy imports as factors contributing to lower inflation implies that the current economic conditions do not warrant tightening of monetary policy."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while interest rates are low, the cost of servicing debt in relation to homeowners' income remains consistent with historical norms. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation through excessive borrowing costs (which would be hawkish) nor is it too accommodative to the point of potentially overheating the housing market (which would be dovish). Instead, it reflects a balance, implying that the current policy is neither particularly tight nor loose in relation to historical standards."
2,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent, although Venezuela provides one counterexample, with a long-term inflation forecast now of 15 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an observation about long-term inflation forecasts, noting that they are generally below 5 percent, with the exception of Venezuela. This statement does not directly indicate a policy action or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is simply a statement of fact regarding inflation expectations, which is one of the factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate concern for the U.S. inflation outlook that would warrant a change in policy stance, nor does it imply that current policies are too restrictive or too accommodative."
0,"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an economic rationale for the development of cities, specifically the concept of labor market pooling and its impact on productivity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how specific labor market dynamics can influence economic productivity, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader economic analysis. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"The large current account deficit was seen as a factor pointing to potential depreciation of the dollar over time, with adverse repercussions on domestic inflation albeit favorable effects on exports.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential inflationary pressures arising from a depreciating dollar due to a large current account deficit. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract the adverse effects on domestic inflation, even though there could be favorable effects on exports. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent inflation from rising above the target level."
2,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it indicates that the speaker considers the equity market as one factor in the broader context of monetary policy decision-making. This reflects a balanced approach, considering various economic indicators without suggesting a particular policy action."
0,"Participants also observed that crude oil prices fell over the intermeeting period and other commodity prices also moderated, developments that were likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that participants observed a decrease in crude oil and other commodity prices, which is expected to reduce headline inflation at the consumer level. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. Lower inflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and may reduce the urgency for a hawkish stance, thus leaning towards a dovish policy implication."
2,"Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the participants' view that recent weather conditions have introduced uncertainty into the economic data, which affects the interpretation of employment and housing indicators. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges an external factor that could be temporarily influencing economic indicators. It suggests a wait-and-see approach, as the impact of the weather is not a structural economic change that would typically warrant a monetary policy adjustment."
0,"Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee's employment objective would be sustained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants view the unemployment rate as higher than desired and express uncertainty about the sustainability of recent improvements in employment. This suggests a stance that is more inclined towards easing monetary policy to support further job growth and progress towards the Committee's employment objective, rather than tightening policy, which would be more likely if they were confident in the employment recovery's sustainability."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives and statutory mandate. The sentence does not indicate a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that more people are working or seeking work, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the sentence does not explicitly state whether this will lead to tighter or looser monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral with respect to policy stance."
1,"On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than-expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential sources of inflationary pressures, such as bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and high rates of resource utilization. The mention of a possible significant rise in inflation expectations altering inflation dynamics suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target. This stance aligns with a hawkish view, where the focus is on controlling inflation, even at the risk of potentially slowing down economic growth."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Low productivity could be a concern for long-term economic growth and could influence the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate action in terms of adjusting the monetary policy. It is a statement of economic condition without a clear implication for policy direction."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations, as measured by the breakevens from inflation-indexed bonds, have decreased. This could suggest that the market anticipates lower inflation in the future, which might be a result of previous tightening measures by the FOMC or expectations of future tightening. A decline in inflation expectations could be seen as a validation of hawkish policy actions aimed at controlling inflation, and it might imply less pressure on the FOMC to implement dovish policies to stimulate the economy."
0,"I expect that to continue, and I would expect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employment that’s for economic reasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation for continued improvement in employment conditions, specifically regarding part-time employment for economic reasons. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the labor market's status. The focus on employment aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but without additional context on inflation or the use of monetary tools, the stance remains neutral."
2,"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the credit market, specifically the growth of subprime mortgage lending, and its implications for credit access among various income groups. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on financial conditions that could be relevant for the FOMC's considerations but does not suggest a specific policy action. The sentence neither implies an immediate concern for inflation (which would be hawkish) nor suggests a need for more accommodative measures (which would be dovish). It is simply a neutral statement regarding the state of credit access."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates expectations of stronger economic growth driven by various positive factors such as easing fiscal policy, rising confidence among consumers and businesses, better credit availability, improved financial conditions, and increased foreign economic growth. This scenario suggests that the economy is heating up, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of past currency movements and their correlation with trade dynamics, without directly suggesting a future course of monetary policy action. It notes the impact of diverging interest rates on the dollar's value and the subsequent effects on exports and import prices, but it does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The statement is more of an economic analysis rather than a clear signal of policy stance."
1,"With capacity utilization already at high levels, relatively rapid growth in inventory investment, if it were superimposed on stronger-than- projected expansion in final demand, could portend serious pressures on resources and inflationary consequences for the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential inflationary pressures due to high levels of capacity utilization and rapid inventory investment, which could lead to an overheating economy if final demand also exceeds projections. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, in line with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a statistical adjustment to unemployment figures and does not directly indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is providing context on labor market conditions, which is one of the factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. However, without an explicit indication of how this information will influence policy, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe the low inflation readings are temporary, as evidenced by a specific measure of inflation (the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation) staying near the Committee's target of 2 percent. This suggests that the Committee may not see a need for an accommodative policy stance to boost inflation, and it could be more inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent potential overheating or future inflationary pressures."
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy by suggesting a ""prudent move"" to ""remove accommodation"" in response to various indicators of a tight labor market. This implies that the FOMC is considering reducing monetary support (which could include raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases) to prevent potential overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants have revised their inflation projections upward because they believe that supply constraints in both product and labor markets are more significant and persistent than they had previously thought. This suggests a concern about higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract these pressures and bring inflation back towards the Committee's 2% target. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy; in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflation expectations becoming unanchored and the Federal Reserve's credibility in achieving disinflation. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy more aggressively to control inflation and restore its credibility, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes a method by which the FOMC might gauge inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. Survey measures of inflation expectations are one of many indicators the FOMC uses to assess economic conditions and guide its policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide information on whether inflation expectations are above or below the target level. It is a statement of fact about the tools used for gauging expectations and does not in itself reflect a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,This was a key reason why currency crises of the past few decades were so costly: Sharp depreciations of the exchange rate boosted the domestic-currency value of foreign debt and wreaked havoc with government finances and corporate balance sheets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the impact of currency crises on economies, specifically mentioning the negative effects of sharp depreciations on government finances and corporate balance sheets. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest an imminent change in policy direction. Instead, it provides context on the potential consequences of exchange rate movements, which is part of the broader economic considerations the FOMC might take into account when making decisions. However, the sentence itself does not advocate for tighter or looser monetary policy."
1,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of the current market conditions in the commercial real estate sector, where there is a mix of high valuations with some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth. This suggests a cautious approach by lenders in response to rising prices, which could be seen as a preventive measure against potential market overheating. However, the statement does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments, such as raising or lowering interest rates, but rather provides an assessment of the financial stability in a specific sector. It reflects a balanced view that is neither clearly advocating for tighter (hawkish) nor looser (dovish) monetary policy."
2,"Although some of the recent data on economic activity had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while some economic data has been better than expected, the overall view of the economic outlook among most participants remains unchanged, with expectations for moderate growth. This suggests that the FOMC's stance is neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy, but rather maintaining a steady course consistent with their existing projections. The use of the word ""moderate"" implies a balanced approach to growth, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear shift in policy direction."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance, which typically involves lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity, for a significant period even after the conclusion of their asset purchase program and as the economic recovery gains strength. This approach is aimed at supporting further progress towards the goals of maximum employment and price stability, suggesting a focus on stimulating the economy rather than preventing overheating, which aligns with a dovish policy stance."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle regarding the Federal Reserve's long-term goals of maximum employment and price stability, suggesting that these objectives are not in conflict over the long term. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms the compatibility of the Fed's dual mandate in the long run."
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of understanding economic conditions to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. This reflects a balanced approach to policy-making, where decisions are based on the assessment of various indicators to meet long-term objectives."
2,"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the modeling of the term structure of interest rates and how these models fit better when they assume changing inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic modeling rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff's projection for the growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down a bit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a revision in the economic forecast without explicitly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It simply states that the staff's projection for GDP growth has been slightly lowered, which could be due to a variety of factors. This information alone does not suggest whether the FOMC will respond with a tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it does not directly reference inflation pressures or employment changes. It is a factual update on economic expectations, which could precede a variety of policy responses depending on broader economic conditions."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a concern."
2,"The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee expects inflation to decrease to levels that align with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This anticipation of lower inflation could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The Committee's expectation that inflation will be at or below the target suggests they might be more inclined to ease monetary policy or keep it accommodative to support employment without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC members are not ready to tighten monetary policy due to weaker labor market conditions and uncertainty about inflation. Waiting for more information before starting policy normalization (which typically involves raising interest rates to prevent overheating of the economy) implies that they are leaning towards maintaining a more accommodative stance to support employment and ensure that inflation moves towards the target rate. This approach is consistent with a dovish stance, which favors easier monetary policy to stimulate economic activity."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and participating Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine process of the FOMC, where members submit their economic projections based on their judgment of appropriate monetary policy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions and setting policy. The focus is on planning and forecasting rather than immediate policy action."
0,"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will take a comprehensive approach to assess the economic situation by considering a variety of indicators before deciding on the duration of an accommodative monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, without a clear indication of leaning towards either tightening or easing. The Committee's focus on a broad set of indicators reflects its commitment to its goals of maximum employment and price stability, and the statement does not signal a clear intent to move in a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented that the statistical and anecdotal information that had become available since the October meeting continued to point to robust growth in overall economic activity, despite some indications of softening in interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite some softening in interest-sensitive sectors, overall economic activity is experiencing robust growth. This suggests that the economy is strong, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, robust growth might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"At the same time, the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient high-tech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending, with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where technological advancements and declining prices for high-tech equipment are expected to support further investment spending and productivity growth. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance but rather provides an observation on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. It reflects an understanding of the nonmonetary factors that can affect the economy, which the FOMC takes into account when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates expectations of strong employment growth and economic activity, bolstered by vaccinations, rising confidence, and supportive fiscal and monetary policies. This suggests that the economy is expanding, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In this context, a ""hawkish"" stance might be appropriate to preemptively tighten monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, indicating that the market's long-term inflation expectations (inflation compensation) have not significantly changed. This observation does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather indicates a stable market outlook on inflation. The FOMC might view this stability as consistent with their inflation goals, suggesting no immediate pressure to adjust policy in response to changing inflation expectations."
0,"Participants also noted that unemployment insurance claims continued to run at a historically elevated level, but the proportion of laid-off workers who expected to be recalled was unusually large.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while unemployment claims are high (which could suggest a dovish stance due to economic weakness), there is also an expectation of workers being recalled to their jobs (which could imply a temporary situation and thus not necessarily warranting a policy change). The balance between these two observations suggests a wait-and-see approach, which is neither clearly hawkish nor dovish, but rather neutral as the FOMC assesses how the situation unfolds."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a perception of weakening in foreign economic activity, which could imply a potential slowdown in global economic conditions. This could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract the negative impacts on the U.S. economy, supporting its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. A weaker foreign outlook might reduce inflationary pressures through lower demand for exports and possibly cheaper imports, thus reducing the need for tightening monetary policy."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is procedural and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It simply states that there will be a presentation on policy alternatives, without giving any hint as to whether the Committee is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy."
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP growth and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting recent financial developments and concerns about the foreign economic outlook, as well as the staff's assessment that neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy appeared well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential negative impacts on economic growth and inflation, suggesting that the economy might be facing headwinds. The mention of risks being ""tilted to the downside"" and the acknowledgment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy seemed well-prepared to counter adverse shocks imply that there may be a need for a more accommodative policy stance to support the economy. This dovish stance is consistent with a readiness to ease monetary policy in order to stimulate growth and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term target."
2,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the behavior of equity prices during different phases of the economic cycle, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It simply acknowledges a pattern in financial markets that is not directly tied to the current stance or future changes in monetary policy."
2,"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply an introductory remark indicating that the speaker will provide a look back at the previous year before discussing the outlook and monetary policy challenges for the current year. It does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy or indicate a direction for future policy actions."
2,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members' assessments of the economic outlook have not significantly changed since their previous meeting. This suggests that they are maintaining their current stance on monetary policy rather than signaling a shift towards tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced view without a clear indication of a move towards a more hawkish or dovish policy direction."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy through this extended period of weakness, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on a sectoral slowdown implies a concern for maintaining employment and economic stability, which could lead to easing policies to counteract the drag on economic activity."
2,Participants commented that demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the demand for labor is exceeding the available supply, and businesses are facing challenges in hiring and retaining workers. This situation suggests that the labor market is tight, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
0,"However, a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil supply rather than softening global demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion among FOMC participants about the reasons behind a recent decline in oil prices, attributing it to a potential increase in oil supply rather than a decrease in global demand. This observation does not directly suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic conditions that could impact inflation, but without a clear indication of how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. The focus on the cause of the oil price decline (supply increase vs. demand decrease) is more about understanding economic dynamics than signaling a policy change."
2,Real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is rapid growth in real outlays for office and computing equipment, with prices for certain types of equipment falling. This information alone does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the current economic conditions regarding technology equipment prices and investments. The FOMC might consider this information in the context of overall inflation and economic growth, but the sentence does not reveal a specific policy stance."
1,Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are in favor of continuing to raise the target range for the federal funds rate gradually. Increasing interest rates is a tool used to tighten monetary policy, which is typically done to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. The use of ""further gradual increases"" suggests a commitment to a continued, albeit measured, tightening cycle, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This approach is intended to sustain the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability, implying that they are focused on preventing the economy from reaching a point where inflation could rise above their target level or where employment could surpass what is considered maximum sustainable employment, potentially leading to inflationary pressures."
0,The weakness in commodity prices and the appreciation of the dollar also continued to weigh on activity in the energy and agricultural sectors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions, specifically the impact of weak commodity prices and a stronger dollar on the energy and agricultural sectors, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic factors that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions, but it does not in itself indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. The FOMC would consider such information in the context of its broader economic outlook and objectives for employment, inflation, and interest rates."
0,"Conversely, fiscal policy expansion in the surplus countries could be used to augment domestic demand, but any such adjustments would need to take account of medium-term goals for fiscal consolidation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential use of fiscal policy to increase domestic demand in countries with a budget surplus, while also considering the importance of medium-term fiscal consolidation goals. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it refers to fiscal policy, which is separate from the monetary policy tools the FOMC directly controls. The sentence does not provide clear signals about adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy measures, thus it is classified as neutral in the context of monetary policy stance."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic conditions warrant maintaining low interest rates, which is indicative of a policy stance that favors easing rather than tightening. This dovish stance is typically adopted to stimulate economic activity and support employment when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"To summarize these international data, one might say that something brought inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s, but success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical observation about inflation trends in the 1980s and 1990s, noting that inflation decreased in both inflation-targeting and non-targeting countries. It does not indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in monetary policy. The statement is merely summarizing past events without advocating for tighter or looser monetary policy in the present context."
1,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.","NEUTRAL

The sentence outlines the Federal Reserve's broad mandates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as financial stability, but does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is a general affirmation of the Fed's responsibilities and does not signal a change in policy stance."
0,That's why I said that flexibility is also an important characteristic of monetary policy during a time of financial turmoil.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of flexibility in monetary policy during financial turmoil, which suggests a balanced approach rather than a clear indication towards tightening or easing. Flexibility allows the FOMC to respond to changing economic conditions in a way that supports their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without committing to a specific direction of policy adjustment."
2,"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically that firms are increasing production in response to higher demand, which is expected to contribute to economic recovery. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of the current economic situation. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring economic indicators but does not suggest an imminent policy action to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation."
1,"Moreover, broad equity price indexes had declined and borrowing costs for nonfinancial firms had increased, including a recent rise in corporate bond yields across most risk categories.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that equity prices have fallen and borrowing costs for nonfinancial firms have risen, including an increase in corporate bond yields across most risk categories. This suggests that financial conditions have tightened, which is often a result of a hawkish monetary policy stance where the central bank may have raised interest rates or signaled a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation or other economic concerns. Tighter financial conditions can be seen as a tool to slow down an overheating economy and bring inflation towards the target level."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests concern about a potential increase in core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by influencing inflation expectations to rise. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from escalating, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to rising inflation to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a consideration of the impact of longer-term interest rates on economic conditions, suggesting that the FOMC's future actions would depend on how these rates evolve. It shows a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and adjusting policy as necessary to maintain their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concerns about negative business sentiment, disappointing growth in sales and profits, and excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software, along with substantial idle capacity in industrial and commercial structures. These factors suggest an economic slowdown or weakness, which would typically lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment, in line with its mandate to support maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of ""curbing capital expenditures"" implies that businesses are not investing, which could further justify a dovish approach to encourage economic activity."
0,"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Committee's commitment to achieving its 2 percent inflation objective, which is a statement of their general policy goal rather than an indication of immediate policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions. It reflects a balanced approach to maintaining price stability, one of the key mandates of the FOMC, without specifying measures that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering a review of its strategy, tools, and communication practices to ensure they are effectively achieving their goals. The mention of the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate, but the Committee is open to making adjustments if necessary. This does not signal an immediate move towards tightening or easing but rather a thoughtful and balanced approach to policy planning, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that certain economic conditions (retail energy prices and consumer confidence) are expected to normalize following a temporary disturbance (post-hurricane increase). This expectation does not inherently signal a need to adjust monetary policy but rather indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of some economic fluctuations. The FOMC may view these expected changes as neutral in terms of their impact on the overall goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Over this period, inflation remained above most definitions of price stability, and the Federal Reserve was not actively seeking to reduce it.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is persistently above the target level of price stability, and it implies that the Federal Reserve might need to take action to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation down to its goal. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, which prioritizes controlling inflation even if it means potentially slowing down the economy."
2,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve price stability and support sustainable economic growth, which are key aspects of its dual mandate (the other being maximum employment). It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes the overall goals of the Committee. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions or react to current economic conditions in a way that would suggest an imminent change in policy."
0,"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the actions of emerging-market economies in response to exchange rate pressures, rather than directly discussing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide clear implications for the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The focus on other economies' currency interventions does not directly reflect the FOMC's policy decisions or objectives."
2,"The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is inclined to keep the current target range for the federal funds rate for a significant period after the end of the asset purchase program, particularly if inflation continues to be below the 2 percent target. This suggests a stance towards easing or at least not tightening monetary policy, as they are willing to maintain lower interest rates to support economic activity and boost inflation towards their objective. The mention of a specific condition (inflation remaining below 2 percent) as a reason to maintain the target range reinforces the dovish stance, as it implies a focus on stimulating the economy to reach the desired inflation level."
2,"When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt.","NEUTRAL

The sentence seems to reflect a general statement about the economy's adjustment process rather than a specific policy direction. It acknowledges that both supply and demand sides of the economy adapt over time, which is a neutral observation and does not directly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests an understanding that the economy is dynamic and that the FOMC monitors these changes to inform its policy decisions, but it does not provide a clear stance on the immediate direction of monetary policy."
2,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy, but it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while wage growth is a factor considered in shaping the inflation outlook, it is not the sole determinant of the FOMC's policy decisions. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the complexity of economic indicators without committing to either a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects an understanding that multiple factors influence inflation and employment, and the FOMC's policy stance will depend on a broader set of data and trends rather than on wage growth alone."
0,"In contrast, some other participants judged that the economy had not yet reached maximum employment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants believe the economy has not achieved the goal of maximum employment, which is one of the key objectives of the Federal Reserve. This view could imply that there is room for the economy to grow without causing inflationary pressures, and therefore, there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy. In a dovish stance, the FOMC might favor maintaining or reducing interest rates to support further job growth until maximum employment is reached."
2,"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are viewing recent lower inflation readings as potentially temporary and are considering an alternative measure of inflation (the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation) that has been stable at or close to the 2% target. This suggests that they do not see a need for an easing of monetary policy due to low inflation figures, as the underlying inflation trend may still be aligned with their target. The mention of stability in this alternative inflation measure implies a readiness to maintain or tighten policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target, reflecting a hawkish stance."
1,"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members observed signs of demand moderation and rising productivity, which were helping to close the gap between aggregate demand and potential supply. This observation was made even before the full effects of previous tightening actions had been realized. The mention of ""earlier Committee tightening actions"" and their ""full restraining effects"" suggests that the FOMC had already been engaged in tightening monetary policy to address economic concerns, and the evidence they observed likely reinforced their decision to maintain or possibly continue a tightening stance. This aligns with a hawkish approach, as it implies a focus on preventing the economy from overheating and keeping inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are concerns about potential risks to inflation and economic growth, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes that the most probable scenario is one where prices remain stable and growth is sustainable. The Committee's decision to maintain a balanced assessment of risks, assuming appropriate policy actions are taken, suggests that they are neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy at this time. They are focused on monitoring the economic indicators and adjusting policy as needed to maintain their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are labor shortages in several districts, which can lead to upward pressure on wages as businesses compete for qualified workers. Higher wages can contribute to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain its inflation target and ensure stable prices. This suggests a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,The September FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved in August our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3 The changes we made in our September FOMC statement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural update where the FOMC's policy guidance is aligned with a new framework established in their Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an adjustment in their approach to policy guidance. The sentence focuses on the alignment with the new framework rather than the implications of that framework for immediate monetary policy actions."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Committee's ongoing discussion and assessment of labor market indicators, which is a part of their mandate to ensure maximum employment. The focus on the adequacy of the unemployment rate as a measure suggests that the FOMC is considering a range of labor market indicators to assess the level of underutilization, which could eventually influence their policy decisions. However, without a specific policy direction implied, the stance remains neutral."
2,"However, the increase in real GDP was projected to be sufficient to reduce slack in the labor market only slowly, and the unemployment rate was expected to remain elevated at the end of 2012.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic growth is expected to be slow, with only a gradual reduction in labor market slack and a persistently high unemployment rate. This suggests that the FOMC might lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to stimulate economic activity and accelerate the reduction of unemployment, in line with its commitment to maximum employment."
1,"I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a clear intention to continue tightening monetary policy through additional rate increases until there is significant progress in reducing inflation. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, which is characterized by raising interest rates to combat high inflation, one of the primary goals of the FOMC."
2,"As you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexity of interpreting economic data for monetary policy decisions. It suggests a thoughtful and measured approach to policy-making, which is consistent with a neutral stance that neither explicitly favors tightening nor easing."
2,"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the rationale behind the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both inflation and output considerations. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather explains the balance the FOMC seeks to achieve between inflation and output. The mention of ""flexible inflation targeters"" suggests that the FOMC is open to allowing some deviations from the exact inflation target to support output, which is a balanced approach."
1,Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of inflation targeting, specifically that it involves enhanced communication and transparency to make the central bank's policy intentions clear. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the approach to policy implementation. The emphasis on communication and transparency is consistent with the FOMC's principles but does not signal a change in the direction of policy."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals, and therefore there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to support further improvements in employment without risking significant inflationary pressure."
0,"The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and its substantial and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy stance through clear guidance and the purchase of longer-term securities. This approach is aimed at supporting the economy in achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability, which suggests a leaning towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy. The use of ""highly accommodative"" implies that the Fed is willing to keep conditions easy to stimulate economic activity and reach its mandated objectives, especially if employment is below its maximum level or if inflation is below the 2% long-term target."
1,"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is incomplete and does not offer enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It merely states a fact about the increase in consumer prices as measured by the PCE price index without indicating whether this increase is above, below, or in line with the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2%. Without additional information on the rate of increase, the implications for monetary policy, or how this figure compares to previous data or expectations, it is not possible to classify the stance as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the classification is neutral."
0,"A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that an increase in final sales (demand) is expected to put greater pressure on resource margins, which implies a potential for higher inflation due to increased demand. Even though this is tempered by the expectation of strong structural productivity growth, which can offset inflationary pressures to some extent, the overall tone indicates concern about inflationary pressures. This concern would typically lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, hence the classification as HAWKISH. The mention that the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time does introduce a note of caution, but the focus on pressure on resource margins suggests a leaning towards a tightening bias."
0,"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC expect a strong expansion in economic activity, supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus, positive financial conditions, and increasing productivity. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"I mean, it really depends on how long it takes for wages and, more than that, prices to come down for inflation to come down.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about high levels of inflation, particularly mentioning the need for wages and prices to come down. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on reducing inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to cool down the economy and bring inflation rates closer to the target. The emphasis on inflation coming down indicates a willingness to maintain or even increase the restrictiveness of monetary policy until the desired inflation levels are achieved."
2,"Thus, reducing vacancies from an extremely high level to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on unemployment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the number of job vacancies and the effects on hiring and unemployment, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates an observation of labor market conditions, which is part of the FOMC's assessment process, but does not in itself advocate for a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is more about the dynamics of the labor market rather than a clear direction on monetary policy adjustments."
1,"Reports from several Districts suggested that firms had greater scope than in the recent past to raise prices in response to strong demand or increases in input costs, including those associated with tariff increases and recent rises in fuel and freight expenses.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that firms are experiencing conditions that allow them to raise prices due to strong demand and higher input costs, including tariffs, fuel, and freight expenses. This scenario suggests inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. The ability of firms to pass on higher costs to consumers could lead to an overall increase in inflation, which the FOMC would aim to control, potentially through raising interest rates."
1,"In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that rising commodity prices are seen more as a reflection of stronger economic activity rather than a direct signal of increasing consumer inflation. This suggests a balanced view where the FOMC recognizes growth in economic activity (which is positive) without immediately linking it to a worrisome increase in inflation that would require a tightening of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent policy adjustment, either towards tightening or easing, but rather an observation of current economic conditions."
0,"While I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to see a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on seeing actual, sustained improvement in inflation before meeting the average inflation goal, which suggests a commitment to not easing monetary policy until inflation trends align more closely with the target. This stance implies a readiness to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to ensure inflation does not run below the desired level, consistent with a hawkish approach to prevent an inflation rate that is too low."
2,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate and keep the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged. This suggests a continuation of the existing monetary policy stance rather than a shift towards tightening or easing. The decision to keep rates steady reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a clear move to counteract inflation or stimulate the economy further."
2,"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today’s policy decision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the attention on the policy decision, without indicating a stance towards increasing or decreasing interest rates or adjusting monetary policy tools. It reflects an awareness of the public's interest in the FOMC's actions but does not reveal the Committee's leanings regarding its policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern about inflation not reaching the target level in a consistent and symmetrical manner, which suggests that the FOMC might consider measures to stimulate inflation, such as easing monetary policy. This dovish stance aligns with efforts to boost economic activity and achieve the inflation target of 2% over the long term."
2,"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific observation regarding retailer behavior without clearly indicating a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges a potential factor that could influence inflation (excess inventories leading to markdowns) but also states that there is no aggregate data to confirm a broader trend of businesses reducing margins. This suggests that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but does not provide evidence of a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a trend toward disinflation, which is a reduction in the rate of inflation, and this trend may continue due to a potentially large amount of economic slack (unused economic capacity). A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that are aimed at stimulating the economy, which may be appropriate when there is significant economic slack and disinflation, as these conditions imply that there is less risk of overheating the economy and causing high inflation. Therefore, the sentence indicates a leaning towards easing monetary policy to counteract disinflation and utilize the economic slack, aligning with a dovish stance."
0,"The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points: “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the use of ""extended period"" language in the FOMC's communication is contingent upon the presence of resource slack, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations. This suggests that the FOMC's policy stance is dependent on these economic conditions, which aligns with a neutral position where the policy could move in either direction (tightening or easing) depending on how these indicators evolve. The sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather it describes a conditional approach to policy formulation."
2,"While favorable financing would help to sustain the housing sector, members anticipated that any further impetus to growth from that sector was likely to be limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while favorable financing conditions could support the housing sector, the FOMC members do not expect significant additional growth from this sector. This suggests a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy, as it neither indicates a concern about overheating (which would be hawkish) nor does it suggest a need for stimulus (which would be dovish). It reflects an expectation of steady conditions in the housing market without implying a change in policy stance."
2,"In its March forecast, the staff's projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was somewhat higher than the one presented in January, mostly reflecting an improved outlook for economic activity abroad, a lower foreign exchange value for the dollar, and a higher projected path of equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an updated economic forecast that is more optimistic than the previous one, due to improved economic conditions abroad, a lower dollar value, and rising equity prices. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic factors that could influence future policy decisions. It reflects a balanced view of the economic outlook without suggesting immediate action to adjust monetary policy."
2,"As a case in point, the increase in the transparency of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical change in the approach to U.S. monetary policy, specifically its transparency, without indicating a current or future direction of policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the stance of monetary policy with respect to employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the key factors in determining a hawkish or dovish stance. Instead, it reflects on a procedural aspect of how the policy is communicated."
2,"For all these conceptual uncertainties and measurement problems, a specific numerical inflation target would represent an unhelpful and false precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses skepticism about the usefulness of a specific numerical inflation target, citing ""conceptual uncertainties and measurement problems."" It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather questions the precision of targeting a specific inflation rate. This stance seems to advocate for flexibility and acknowledges the complexities in setting and achieving precise inflation targets, which aligns with a balanced approach to monetary policy."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have agreed to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, which suggests that they are neither looking to tighten (raise rates) nor ease (lower rates) monetary policy at this time. This decision reflects a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices without any immediate action to change the policy stance."
2,"However, in this framework, the current period appears to be an outlier.4 That is, even after factoring in the current-cycle dynamics of strong profit growth and relatively modest investment, a good part of the rise in liquid assets remains unaccounted for--as much as one half of the total rise in cash-to-assets--according to Federal Reserve staff estimates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is a significant rise in liquid assets that cannot be fully explained by the current economic dynamics, suggesting that there might be excess liquidity in the market. This unaccounted increase in cash-to-assets could potentially lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such a scenario, the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The focus on preventing excess liquidity from causing inflation is in line with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects to make gradual adjustments to monetary policy, which suggests a balanced approach to achieving its goals of economic expansion, a stronger labor market, and by implication, stable prices. The use of the word ""gradual"" implies a measured and cautious approach, neither signaling an aggressive tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy. The statement reflects a commitment to fostering conditions that support the FOMC's mandate of maximum employment and price stability without indicating a clear shift in policy direction."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic slowdown is partly temporary and anticipates greater growth in the future. This implies an expectation of economic recovery without the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current policy to encourage economic growth. The sentiment expressed does not indicate a concern for rising inflation that would necessitate a hawkish approach."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic forecast has been revised down due to the impact of federal spending cuts, suggesting that economic growth is expected to slow. This slowdown, caused by reduced government purchases, could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to counteract the drag on the economy, aligning with a dovish approach that favors easing to support growth and employment."
2,"In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about technological innovation and its impact on productivity, specifically the spread of electrification to the factory floor following World War I. It does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates that would influence the current monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral with respect to monetary policy."
2,"That is, monetary policy responds to changes in fiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equity prices, exchange rates, or the demand for U.S. exports due to changed growth prospects abroad.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) approach to monetary policy as being responsive to various economic factors, including fiscal policy changes, equity prices, exchange rates, and international demand for U.S. exports. It does not indicate a specific direction (tightening or easing) of policy but rather emphasizes the Committee's adaptability to a range of economic influences. This suggests a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term implications of increases in productivity growth rates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a factor that can influence economic performance. Higher productivity growth can lead to non-inflationary economic expansion, which is generally positive for the economy, but the sentence does not provide enough context to determine a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
0,"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the producer price index for core intermediate materials, which is a measure of inflation at the production level, continued to decline. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not building up at the earlier stages of production. A declining or low inflation rate is often a signal for a central bank to maintain or ease monetary policy, rather than tighten it, to support economic activity and move closer to its inflation target. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, implying there may be less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of inflation expectations without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy action. It suggests that stable inflation expectations can help maintain low and stable inflation, but it does not directly imply an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on the importance of public perception in achieving the FOMC's inflation goals, rather than on a current policy stance."
2,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, they are still low, and survey-based expectations for long-term inflation have not changed significantly. This suggests that the FOMC sees some signs of inflation but not enough to warrant a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The statement reflects an observation of current economic indicators without a strong implication of immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically a weakening expansion in capital expenditures that may be due to an excess in capacity after a period of significant growth in certain industries. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of recent economic developments. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring economic indicators that could influence their policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In view of the most recent information on the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate for the post-meeting statement to characterize economic growth as apparently continuing to moderate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of the current economic condition, stating that economic growth seems to be moderating. This description does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of the economic situation. It reflects a balanced view without a clear indication of a move towards either a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) stance."
2,"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests that the speaker will discuss potential economic issues such as equity price imbalances, personal saving rates, current account status, and household debt burden. These topics are important for understanding the economic context and potential risks, but without additional context on the speaker's view or intended policy response, the sentence itself is neutral. It reflects an awareness of issues that could influence monetary policy decisions but does not commit to any particular action."
0,"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects real GDP growth to exceed potential growth due to a highly accommodative monetary policy, which would lead to a decrease in unemployment to historically low levels. This suggests that the economy is performing strongly, and there may be less need for an accommodative stance going forward. The anticipation of strong growth and low unemployment could signal a future tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potentially higher short-term inflation rates, which suggests a preference for measures to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. This stance aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, which is considered hawkish."
1,The staff also reduced slightly its forecast of growth next year but continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic growth forecast, indicating a slight reduction in the growth forecast for the next year but expecting a moderate strengthening and further pickup in the following years. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic outlook. It reflects a balanced view that is neither overtly optimistic (which might suggest a hawkish stance) nor pessimistic (which might suggest a dovish stance)."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond to monetary policy actions aimed at boosting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects a balanced view on the tools available for managing the economy, without a clear direction toward either a more hawkish or dovish monetary policy stance."
1,"Many observed, however, that a favorable outcome to the hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices in line with quotations in futures markets should generate a positive response in equity markets, boost consumer sentiment, and foster a rebound in consumer spending as the year progressed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where external factors (resolution of hostilities in the Middle East and lower oil prices) could lead to positive economic outcomes such as a boost in equity markets, consumer sentiment, and consumer spending. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather discusses potential economic developments that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC might adjust its policy in response to these changes, but the sentence itself does not commit to either tightening or easing."
1,"Once such expectations became imbedded in the economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order to reestablish a downward trend of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that to prevent inflation expectations from becoming entrenched, the FOMC might need to take more aggressive policy actions, which typically means raising interest rates or tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This stance aligns with a hawkish view, as it suggests a readiness to act firmly against inflation, even if it requires stronger measures."
1,"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a view that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect a tightening labor market, suggesting that the FOMC members are not convinced that the economy is overheating or that there is a need to tighten policy aggressively. This perspective neither clearly signals an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather a wait-and-see approach as they assess the labor market conditions."
1,"In particular, investors noted that the Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors, retained its earlier balance of risks assessment, and reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee acknowledges the recent increase in inflation and suggests a gradual removal of policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases. The use of ""measured"" implies a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy, but it is still a move towards tightening rather than easing, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The goal is to prevent inflation from rising too far above the target level while balancing the risks to ensure long-term stability and employment goals are met."
2,"Members also agreed that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to evaluating progress towards its goals by considering a broad set of economic indicators. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes a balanced and comprehensive assessment of various economic factors. This approach is consistent with a neutral stance, as it suggests that the Committee's future policy actions will depend on the interpretation of incoming data relative to their objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
2,The recent information on inflation was seen as disappointing.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""The recent information on inflation was seen as disappointing"" suggests that inflation is not meeting the expectations or targets set by the FOMC, which typically aims for a 2% inflation rate over the long term. If inflation is lower than expected, it could imply that the economy is not overheating and there may be less need for tightening monetary policy. Instead, the FOMC might consider maintaining or even easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and push inflation towards its target level. This stance is therefore considered dovish, as it leans towards policies that support economic growth and employment, rather than focusing on curbing inflation."
2,Consider our estimates of real economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Consider our estimates of real economic activity"" does not provide any specific direction on monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that suggests the FOMC is taking into account the current state of the economy, which is a standard part of their decision-making process. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,It will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy has been tightened, which is a measure typically taken to reduce inflation. The mention of a ""cumulative effect"" suggests that previous actions have been aimed at constraining economic activity to some extent in order to lower inflation towards the target level. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by efforts to cool down the economy and prevent overheating, thereby ensuring price stability."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation due to historical experiences. This statement is more of an observation on economic behavior and historical context rather than a direct indication of current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
2,The members expected price pressures to remain relatively contained over the next several quarters in the context of what they anticipated would be only a gradual reduction of the excess capacity in labor and product markets as the recovery progressed.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members expect inflation to remain under control in the near future, with a slow reduction in excess capacity in labor and product markets. This suggests that there is no immediate concern for inflationary pressures that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Instead, the expectation of contained price pressures aligns with a stance that would support maintaining or easing monetary policy to foster economic recovery without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a data-dependent approach to monetary policy, indicating that the FOMC is neither predisposed to tightening nor easing but is waiting for more information to decide on the appropriate course of action. This reflects a balanced stance that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish, as it does not commit to any specific policy changes but rather emphasizes the importance of evaluating new economic data as it becomes available."
1,Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern among FOMC participants that rising inflation could negatively impact the economy over the long term. This concern typically indicates a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, aligning with a hawkish view that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down inflationary pressures."
2,"Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which is a measure of wage inflation and can be an indicator of overall inflationary pressures in the economy. The fact that the ECI growth rate has not returned to pre-2008 levels could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context. It does not inherently suggest that the FOMC should either raise or lower interest rates, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"So the—the sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner people can regain that confidence and regain their economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the impact of the virus on economic confidence and activity, rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It suggests that controlling the virus is key to economic recovery, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not explicitly signal an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is more about the conditions necessary for economic improvement rather than a specific monetary policy direction."
2,"The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there are multiple factors (monetary ease, fiscal stimulus, productivity gains, and improved business confidence) that are expected to provide a strong boost to spending. This could lead to increased inflationary pressures, which might require the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, in line with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target over the long term."
0,"If labor demand cools, will separations increase and shift the curve outward, increasing unemployment further?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is speculative in nature and does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It poses a question about the potential relationship between labor demand and unemployment rates, which is a consideration for policy decisions but does not in itself suggest an imminent policy action. The FOMC might use such analysis to inform future decisions, but the sentence alone does not advocate for a specific monetary policy direction."
1,"It is important to recognize the importance of moving interest rates in response to changing conditions and the potential for destabilizing policy when policy resists the natural tendency for interest rates to rise during cyclical upswings, especially when the economy is near its potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) acknowledges the need to increase interest rates in response to cyclical economic improvements, particularly when the economy is performing close to its potential. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation with conflicting economic signals: strong private domestic demand on one side and negative external influences from the Asian crisis on the other. This indicates a balance of factors that could potentially affect monetary policy in different directions. It does not explicitly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC must consider."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite core inflation and the trimmed mean PCE inflation rate being slightly below the 2% target, many participants expect inflation to remain near the target level due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests that the FOMC sees the economy as operating near its full potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"The Committee also noted that output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had appeared to pick up, and although incoming data on inflation showed that it had moved somewhat higher, longer-term inflation expectations had remained well contained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economy is expanding at a solid pace and hiring is increasing, which are signs of a strong economy. Additionally, while inflation has risen, the long-term expectations for inflation are stable. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, comparing it to historical averages without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy but rather communicates an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on a range of indicators."
2,Consumer food prices were little changed in August.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Consumer food prices were little changed in August"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about price stability in a specific category (food) over a short period (one month). This could be interpreted as a sign of stable prices, which aligns with one of the FOMC's goals, but without additional context on the broader inflation trends or economic conditions, it does not suggest a clear monetary policy stance."
2,"Stock prices in the basic materials and industrial sectors underperformed the broader market, reportedly reflecting an increase in trade tensions with China.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation related to stock prices in specific sectors and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather reports on the economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The mention of trade tensions with China is a factor that the FOMC might consider in its broader economic analysis, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation rates are close to the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining price stability. There is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease the policy based on this information alone, as the inflation rates are near the desired level."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a trade-off for achieving price stability. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, even at the cost of potentially negative impacts on employment and growth, which is characteristic of a hawkish stance."
2,One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a monetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical contribution to monetary policy analysis rather than indicating a current policy stance or future policy action. It reflects on a methodological approach to forecasting inflation, which is a tool used by the FOMC to inform their decisions, but does not in itself suggest a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which does not clearly signal a need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards a hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) policy action."
1,"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the macroeconomic data has been stronger than expected, with a significant rebound in GDP growth. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures if the growth is above potential. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
2,"Median inflation in the nine countries likewise declined, averaging 9-1/2 percent in 1995-99 and 5 percent in 2000-04.Return to text 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical data on inflation rates in nine countries, showing a decline over time. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The information is merely descriptive and does not suggest a clear direction for policy adjustments. It reflects an observation of past economic conditions rather than a current or forward-looking monetary policy stance."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's future decisions regarding the pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction will be data-dependent, reflecting a stance that is neither explicitly in favor of tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy. It suggests a wait-and-see approach, where actions will be based on the economic indicators relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In fact, the Federal Reserveâ€™s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 Homeownership The important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Federal Reserve's Community Affairs Research Conference and the role of expanded access to mortgage credit in increasing homeownership. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Instead, it focuses on research and access to credit, which are more informational in nature and do not signal a specific policy direction."
0,"On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that core consumer price inflation will remain low or even decrease, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This dovish stance implies a leaning towards maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support economic activity, as low inflation is not threatening the FOMC's goal of stable prices around the 2% target."
0,"Well, you know, if the economy were disappointing, we—you know, our actions wouldn’t purely be based on inflation, we would also take employment into account.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC would consider a more accommodative monetary policy stance (i.e., not just tightening due to inflation) if the economy underperforms, taking into account the goal of maximum employment. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy in the face of economic weakness, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,The idea is that providing more information about the Committee's views of the economic outlook may allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to transparency and communication with the financial markets, rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It suggests that by sharing their economic outlook, the Committee aims to help the market better understand and anticipate future policy moves, which could be either tightening or easing, depending on the economic conditions. This statement is more about the method of communication rather than the content of the policy itself."
2,"In the end, they concurred that the statement should note that economic growth had rebounded in the current quarter but that it appeared likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while economic growth has picked up, it is expected to slow down to a more sustainable level. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, neither indicating a need for immediate tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects an expectation of normalization in economic activity, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear direction for policy change."
2,"These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the central bank would need to foster expectations of inflation to lower real interest rates when nominal rates are at or near zero. This suggests a willingness to tolerate or even aim for higher inflation, which is typically addressed by tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this stance leans towards preventing inflation from deviating above their target, which is a hawkish position."
2,"In a traditional growth accounting setup, these effects would show up in multifactor productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical statement about how certain economic effects would be reflected in a measure of economic productivity (multifactor productivity growth) within a growth accounting framework. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it discusses a method of economic analysis, which is neutral with respect to the direction of monetary policy."
1,"The central tendency rises to 2.4 to 2.7 percent next year, somewhat above estimates of the longer-run growth rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the central tendency for economic growth is projected to rise to levels that are somewhat above the estimates of the longer-run growth rate. This suggests that the economy might be growing at a pace that could potentially lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if growth is expected to exceed the sustainable long-run growth rate, the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the asset purchases are aimed at stimulating the economy and supporting growth and job creation in the near term, which is a form of monetary easing. The mention of increases in the federal funds rate target as a future action to reduce accommodation suggests that the current stance is accommodative, aligning with a dovish policy to encourage economic activity and employment. The focus on creating momentum in the economy implies that the FOMC is prioritizing support for the economy over immediate concerns about inflation, which is consistent with a dovish approach."
0,"However, those concerns generally were seen as outweighed by the benefit of avoiding tying the Committee's decision too closely to the unemployment rate alone, while still being clear about the Committee's intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for providing monetary accommodation to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices. This suggests a willingness to maintain or introduce measures that would ease monetary policy, rather than tighten it, in order to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability. The concern about not focusing solely on the unemployment rate implies a broader view of economic health, which may include keeping policies accommodative even if unemployment rates are low, as long as it supports the broader goals of the Committee."
2,"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation, which suggests that the FOMC is concerned about potential inflationary pressures. Being ""particularly vigilant"" implies that the Committee is ready to act, possibly by tightening monetary policy, to ensure inflation remains in check. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and suggests a stance that leans towards preventing higher inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
0,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary conditions. This is in line with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with policies that are aimed at stimulating economic activity, such as lowering interest rates or purchasing assets, to achieve maximum employment and price stability, especially during challenging times."
2,The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method of gathering information rather than indicating a direction for monetary policy. It explains that the FOMC presidents include anecdotal evidence in their reports to gain insights into regional economic conditions, which is a part of their information-gathering process and does not directly suggest a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where, in the absence of economic shocks and with appropriate monetary policy, there is an expectation of moderate economic growth and a slight decrease in the unemployment rate. This suggests a balanced view that does not explicitly indicate a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a steady-state expectation consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear shift in policy stance."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real rate in the context of productivity trends. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an economic scenario and its potential impact on interest rates. The focus is on the balance between fiscal policy and economic growth, which is a consideration for the FOMC but does not in itself suggest a change in the monetary policy stance."
2,"On balance, while the business investment outlook seemed vulnerable to somewhat greater than projected weakness in the short run, the members were persuaded that, against the background of large continuing gains in structural productivity and cost savings from further investment in equipment and software, business firms were likely to accelerate their spending for new capital after a period of adjustment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is some concern about potential short-term weakness in business investment, the FOMC members believe that structural productivity gains and cost savings from investment in equipment and software will lead to an increase in capital spending after an adjustment period. This suggests a balanced view, acknowledging both a potential downside risk and an upside expectation without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on structural productivity and investment indicates a long-term perspective rather than an immediate policy action stance."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite expectations of moderate real growth, the speaker believes this growth will not be sufficient to reduce core inflation. This implies a concern for persistent inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from staying above the target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about market expectations leaning too much towards further easing of monetary policy, which suggests a preference to avoid signaling a likelihood of future rate cuts. This stance implies a readiness to maintain or increase interest rates to prevent such expectations from becoming entrenched, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability and manage inflation expectations."
2,"Other economies, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is merely stating a fact about the monetary systems in Argentina and Hong Kong, without indicating any particular stance on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. It does not suggest any action or inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC. The sentence does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it imply any adjustments to the federal funds rate or other policy measures."
0,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the Federal Reserve's tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary policy in order to promote employment and price stability. This is particularly dovish as it implies a willingness to take action in response to challenging economic conditions, which often involves lowering interest rates or other forms of monetary stimulus."
2,"And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the dynamic nature of the maximum level of employment in relation to price stability, acknowledging that it changes over time due to various factors, including those related to the pandemic. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the considerations that affect the FOMC's assessment of the employment situation within the context of its dual mandate. The statement is focused on the framework and factors influencing the labor market rather than signaling a specific policy direction."
2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the stock market experienced a positive surge, core inflation—which is a key indicator for monetary policy—has moderated. This suggests a balanced situation where there is economic growth (as evidenced by a soaring stock market) without an accompanying increase in inflationary pressures. The moderation in core inflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, and the positive stock market performance could be indicative of a healthy economy, which is in line with the goal of maximum employment. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states that the FOMC has multiple forecasts at its disposal when making monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a general statement about the resources available to the Committee for informed decision-making. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to using a range of indicators and data to guide its policy actions."
0,The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically noting a slowdown in growth across various expenditure sectors. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of economic activity, which could be used to inform future policy decisions based on how it aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates being able to adjust policy in a way that results in lower-than-expected increases in unemployment. This implies a focus on supporting employment levels, which is consistent with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and reduce the risk of rising unemployment. The mention of the high ratio of vacancies to unemployed being ""out of keeping with historical experience"" indicates that the labor market is tighter than usual, which could typically lead to inflationary pressures. However, the emphasis on preventing a rise in unemployment suggests that the FOMC may prioritize employment over immediate inflation concerns, aligning with a dovish approach."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to continue or increase monetary stimulus through asset purchases unless there is a substantial improvement in the labor market, and this is done in the context of maintaining price stability. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is prepared to use its tools to support employment, one of its key mandates, as long as inflation remains stable. The focus on continued asset purchases and potential additional measures to stimulate the economy is characteristic of a dovish policy stance."
1,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the FOMC's commitment to delivering price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By highlighting price stability as a significant asset, it suggests that the Committee may prioritize measures to prevent inflation from rising, which could include tightening monetary policy. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on restraining inflation, even if it might involve increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) commitment to maintaining inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent target, which is consistent with their price stability mandate. It acknowledges the challenge of doing so, especially when the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate limits the Committee's ability to respond to downturns. This statement does not directly indicate a current or future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of managing inflation expectations within the existing policy framework. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the long-term inflation goal, without signaling a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In their discussion of considerations related to asset purchases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve's response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recovery.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants view asset purchases as a critical response to the economic effects of the pandemic, aiming to support financial market functioning and maintain accommodative financial conditions. This suggests a policy stance that is geared towards easing, as asset purchases are typically used to inject liquidity into the economy, lower interest rates, and encourage borrowing and spending, which can help in achieving maximum employment and supporting the recovery. The focus on aiding the flow of credit to households and businesses aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally supportive of growth and less concerned with immediate inflation pressures."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement reflecting on the Federal Reserve's past success in achieving its inflation target. It does not directly indicate any current or future policy actions or stances toward tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides context about the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation goals and its past performance relative to those goals."
0,The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to making adjustments to its securities holdings based on new information to support its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows a readiness to respond to changing economic conditions in either direction. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in the best interest of its dual mandate."
2,"Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants expect inflation to stabilize at the Committee's target rate as transitory factors diminish and the labor market improves. This expectation suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate to achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment, without explicitly signaling a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy in the immediate future. It reflects a balanced view that the economy is moving toward the desired outcomes without the need for a change in policy stance."
2,An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analytical perspective on understanding financial market prices by identifying risk premiums. This is part of the broader assessment process that informs the FOMC's policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both a negative factor (a spike in energy prices eroding real income growth) and a positive factor (solid gains in wages and salaries), which suggests a balanced view of economic conditions. It does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it presents both inflationary pressures (rising energy prices) and signs of a healthy labor market (increasing wages and salaries). This balance implies a neutral stance in the context of the FOMC's goals for employment and price stability."
1,"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise due to the end or reversal of temporary factors that were keeping prices low. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a focus on price stability, which is often associated with a restrictive monetary policy stance. The mention of ""leaning against cyclical increases in demand"" implies a willingness to tighten policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which could lead to inflation exceeding the target. This aligns with a hawkish approach, where the priority is to control inflation, even at the risk of slowing down economic growth."
0,"Total nonfarm payroll employment was reported to have decreased in September, consistent with a substantial increase in the number of people who reported themselves as being absent from work due to bad weather and with payroll declines in the hurricane-affected states of Texas and Florida.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where employment figures have decreased due to temporary and external factors (bad weather and hurricanes). This does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance, as the employment changes are attributed to nonmonetary factors that are likely to be temporary. The FOMC would likely view such a situation as not warranting a change in policy in response to these short-term fluctuations, as their focus is on long-term economic trends and stability."
2,"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call ""changes in discount rates,"" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various non-fundamental factors that can affect financial markets, such as changes in investor sentiment, risk aversion, and internal market dynamics. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of factors that can influence market variations, which is a neutral observation regarding monetary policy actions."
1,"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distributionâ€”for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes ongoing bottlenecks in production and distribution, which are likely to contribute to inflationary pressures by increasing costs and limiting supply. The mention of rising prices due to a poor cotton crop and logistical issues like clogged ports and trucker shortages suggests that the economy is facing supply-side constraints that could lead to higher inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a technical factor (base effects) that will temporarily influence inflation measurements. It does not directly indicate a policy action or change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Base effects refer to the impact of past low inflation rates on current year-over-year inflation calculations, which can cause temporary distortions in inflation data. The FOMC is likely to look through such temporary factors when making policy decisions, unless they alter the medium-term outlook for inflation."
0,"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of lower oil prices on commodity-exporting countries and the subsequent spillover effects on the global economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on external economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus is on the observation of international economic developments rather than a clear direction for domestic monetary policy adjustments."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the equilibrium real rate in the context of long-term economic balance, considering factors like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate a current or future change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather emphasizes the importance of understanding a fundamental economic concept that informs policy decisions. The focus on the equilibrium rate is about gauging the appropriate level of interest rates over the long term to achieve balance in the economy, which is a neutral and informative statement rather than one that signals an immediate policy shift."
2,Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to the U.K. recession of 1974 and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it discuss current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a robust labor market, characterized by low unemployment and rising wages. This scenario could lead to inflationary pressures, as higher wages can increase spending and demand, potentially pushing prices up. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of strengthening household demand due to increased equity prices and fiscal policy support, which does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a commitment to adjust monetary policy in response to those conditions. The expectation of stronger demand could potentially lead to higher inflation or employment, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate policy action to either counteract or encourage this development."
2,"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation affecting emerging markets due to declines in oil prices, which is an external economic factor rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in its decision-making process."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while there is recognition of the need for more cumulative tightening (which is a hawkish stance), the FOMC members do not see the need for an accelerated pace of policy tightening at the moment. This is because they believe there is still some economic slack, productivity growth is likely to keep unit labor costs and prices in check, and inflation is expected to remain contained. Despite the current decision against an accelerated pace, the acknowledgment of the need for more tightening overall suggests a leaning towards a hawkish stance, as it implies a future intent to raise interest rates or reduce monetary accommodation to address inflation concerns and maintain price stability."
0,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and move inflation towards the target."
1,"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an anticipation of tightening monetary policy, which is typically associated with a HAWKISH stance. The reference to ""tightening"" suggests that the FOMC is considering raising interest rates or taking other measures to reduce monetary accommodation. This action is usually taken in response to a strengthening economy and aims to prevent overheating and control inflation. The mention of a ""more firmly established economic recovery"" implies that the economy is doing well enough to withstand the effects of tighter monetary policy, and the expectation is that any negative impacts on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) will be offset by increased external demand, which further supports the HAWKISH interpretation."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic environment with a strong performance and ample credit availability, which is generally conducive to the growth of innovative enterprises. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the economic conditions. The statement is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not suggest any immediate policy action."
1,"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that if labor market conditions continue to improve and inflation trends towards the FOMC's target, the Committee is likely to decrease the pace of its asset purchases. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as reducing asset purchases would be a step towards less monetary accommodation. The intent to scale back asset purchases is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it implies a move to restrain potential inflationary pressures and support the goal of stable prices."
1,"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where inflation expectations, as measured by the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), have increased slightly but are still aligned with levels seen before the pandemic. This observation does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it indicates that market participants' expectations of inflation are stable, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement does not provide clear evidence of a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance."
2,That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the nature of foreign trade deficits, suggesting that they tend to correct themselves over time without implying any immediate action or concern for monetary policy. It does not specifically address the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a change in the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both headline and core inflation are expected to remain low and stable, with little change from previous projections. This suggests that there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current policy to support employment and economic growth, given that inflation is not a current concern."
2,"So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a prelude to a discussion about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor easing of policy but rather sets the stage for an analysis of external economic factors."
1,"The July-August deficit in U. S. trade in goods and services was higher than its average in the second quarter, as further growth in imports exceeded the rise in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance, specifically the deficit in trade of goods and services, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It merely states a fact about trade dynamics, which could have various implications for the economy, but does not in itself indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy. The trade deficit can be influenced by many factors, including currency exchange rates, economic growth rates, and global economic conditions, which are not solely within the purview of monetary policy."
2,"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of economic activity in major foreign industrial countries, noting variations in growth rates but not directly indicating a change in U.S. monetary policy stance. It provides context on global economic conditions, which the FOMC may consider in its decision-making process, but it does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of U.S. monetary policy. The focus on foreign economic activity does not directly relate to the FOMC's domestic goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it imply a specific direction for policy adjustments."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expansion in monetary aggregates due to increased demand for currency and inflows to retail money market funds, which could be a response to weakness in the U.S. bond and equity markets. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's monitoring of various economic indicators, which is consistent with their goal of maintaining stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The expansion of monetary aggregates could be seen as potentially inflationary (which might suggest a hawkish stance) or as a response to economic weakness (which might suggest a dovish stance), but without further context on the FOMC's interpretation or policy response, the stance is NEUTRAL."
2,"Given that we have yet to experience difficulties in funding a current account deficit that exceeds 6 percent of our GDP, what are the limits to the foreign markets' absorption of claims on U.S. residents?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the capacity of foreign markets to absorb U.S. debt, which is a consideration of the broader economic context rather than a direct statement about monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather raises a question about international finance conditions that could impact the U.S. economy. The FOMC might use such information to inform its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where inflation expectations are well-anchored, leading to moderate wage-setting and pricing behavior, which in turn helps the Federal Reserve maintain low inflation. This reflects a balanced view of the economy where neither a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy is implied. It suggests that if the public trusts the Fed to control inflation, the economy will naturally tend toward stability, which aligns with the Fed's goals without indicating a need for immediate policy action."
2,"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a descriptive statement about the behavior of economic indicators, without a clear implication for immediate monetary policy action. It reflects an understanding of economic patterns that could inform policy decisions, but it does not suggest a current stance on adjusting the monetary policy."
2,"Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that real yields (interest rates adjusted for inflation) have increased more than nominal yields, and the market's expectation for inflation (inflation compensation) has declined. This suggests that monetary policy may be tightening, as higher real yields can be associated with efforts to control inflation, which is in line with a hawkish stance. The decline in inflation expectations could also reflect the success of such policies in convincing the market that inflation will be kept under control."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the FOMC views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower, indicating a stance that is neither particularly inclined towards tightening nor easing monetary policy. This balanced view implies that the Committee does not see a clear need to adjust policy in either direction to achieve their inflation goal at the moment."
0,"However, this shortfall partly reflected the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports, and some participants pointed out that, by some measures, the most recent monthly inflation readings had firmed a bit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both a shortfall in inflation due to transitory factors like energy prices and non-energy import prices, as well as a slight firming in recent monthly inflation readings. This suggests a balanced view, recognizing temporary downward pressures on inflation as well as signs of inflation stabilizing or increasing slightly. It does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an observation of mixed signals in the inflation data."
2,You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflective of a rhetorical question about the process of monetary policymaking and does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather comments on the complexity of the policymaking process."
0,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to ease monetary policy by using a full range of tools to support the economy in response to increased downward risks to employment and inflation due to the constraints imposed by the lower bound of interest rates. This suggests a readiness to take action to stimulate economic activity if necessary, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes boosting employment and inflation towards the Committee's targets."
2,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the complexity of economic forecasting and acknowledges that tax policy changes are just one of many factors influencing growth and inflation projections. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where the FOMC considers a wide range of data and factors before making decisions."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees both economic activity and inflation projections as having more downside risks. This suggests that there is a concern about economic weakness and lower inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and move inflation towards the target level."
0,"Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the labor market, specifically mentioning that job losses, although moderating, are still occurring, and that there is a high number of people working part-time for economic reasons, as well as a low average workweek. These factors suggest that the labor market is not at full strength, which aligns with a dovish stance as it implies that there may be a need for continued monetary policy support to achieve maximum employment. The gradual decline in the unemployment rate suggests that the FOMC may not see an immediate need to tighten monetary policy, as doing so could hinder the recovery of the labor market."
2,"In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the behavior of various estimates of the natural rate of interest (r*) and expected inflation, noting that they have moved broadly together over time. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic indicators that the FOMC might use to inform its policy decisions. The sentence suggests a balanced view of the relationship between r* and inflation expectations without advocating for a specific monetary policy action."
0,"The expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce the slack in labor and product markets over the projection period, and progress in reducing the unemployment rate was expected to be gradual.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth and a slow reduction in unemployment, without explicitly indicating a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests a steady approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without signaling an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC members expect inflation to moderate, they still see the need to monitor inflation developments closely. This suggests a balanced approach, as they are neither signaling an immediate need to tighten policy aggressively (which would be hawkish) nor indicating a need to ease policy due to diminishing inflation concerns (which would be dovish). They are maintaining vigilance and are prepared to adjust policy as needed to achieve their goals, reflecting a neutral stance."
2,Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Measures of inflation compensation were little changed on net"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations of inflation, which does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. This statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it simply reports a neutral observation regarding inflation expectations."
2,"Housing demand remained strong, but business fixed investment was still in the doldrums and consumer spending had flagged in late summer before apparently picking up somewhat in the autumn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes mixed economic conditions, with strong housing demand on one side and weaker business investment and variable consumer spending on the other. This suggests a balanced view of the economy without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might see the strong housing demand as a positive sign, while the weak business investment and fluctuating consumer spending could be seen as areas of concern, but the sentence does not explicitly suggest a policy action in response to these observations."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply acknowledges external economic developments without suggesting a specific policy response by the FOMC."
1,"During the past several years, workers across the wage distribution--not just at the upper end--have seen noticeable increases in the inflation-adjusted value of their wages.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that workers across various wage levels have experienced real wage growth, which could suggest broad-based wage pressures that might contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if wage growth is strong and widespread, it could lead to inflationary pressures that exceed the Committee's 2% target. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's commitment to maintaining its inflation goal of 2 percent over the long term and emphasizes the importance of keeping inflation expectations anchored at this level. It does not explicitly indicate a current direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the strategy for achieving the inflation target. The mention of conducting policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run expectations anchored suggests a balanced approach to managing inflation consistent with the Committee's price stability mandate."
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core consumer price inflation are low and that near-term inflation expectations have remained below previous high levels, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Additionally, the mention of a weakened economic outlook implies that there may be a need to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment."
1,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a recognition of positive economic developments, particularly in terms of progress towards the goal of maximum employment. However, it does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The statement reflects an acknowledgment of achieving a key aspect of the FOMC's mandate—maximum employment—without directly indicating a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the trade deficit and the behavior of exports and imports, which does not inherently indicate whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence does not provide information on how this might affect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"After robust growth in the second quarter, M2 decelerated somewhat and M3 was about unchanged in July.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes recent trends in monetary aggregates (M2 and M3) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It simply states that there was robust growth in M2 in the second quarter, followed by a deceleration, and that M3 remained about unchanged in July. This information is indicative of the state of the money supply but does not inherently signal a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a reporting of financial conditions rather than a policy stance."
2,"Our test for this step was making ""substantial further progress"" toward our employment and inflation goals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition set by the FOMC for adjusting its policy stance, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing. It reflects a commitment to achieving their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices but does not specify the actions that will be taken once the ""substantial further progress"" is made. This suggests a balanced approach, contingent on future economic indicators."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This communication strategy is aimed at influencing the pricing of longer-term interest rates to align with the monetary policy path they deem most likely. Keeping interest rates low is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it indicates a policy geared towards stimulating economic activity, supporting employment, and countering low inflation, rather than tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perspective on the unemployment rate is one of uncertainty, with risks seen as ""roughly balanced."" This suggests that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on the current unemployment situation. The use of the term ""roughly balanced"" implies that they believe the risks to unemployment are neither significantly to the upside (which might be inflationary and thus require a hawkish response) nor to the downside (which might indicate a need for a dovish response to stimulate employment). Instead, the stance is neutral, indicating a wait-and-see approach."
2,"Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where increases in productivity have led to higher profit margins, which could help companies absorb cost increases temporarily. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an observation on economic conditions that could affect inflationary pressures. It suggests that there may be some buffer against inflation due to higher profit margins, but it does not explicitly advocate for either tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to tolerate a higher inflation rate in exchange for a lower unemployment rate. This indicates a preference for easing monetary policy to support employment, even at the cost of allowing inflation to rise above the target level, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply acknowledges the existence of consistently measured prices in principle, which is a foundational concept for the FOMC's goal of price stability. The statement does not provide information on current economic conditions, inflation trends, or employment levels that would suggest a shift in policy. It is a neutral remark on the theoretical underpinning of price measurement rather than a comment on current policy or future policy direction."
2,"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to ""look through"" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the considerations that monetary policymakers must take into account when assessing the impact of disasters on the economy. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the need for careful analysis to determine the appropriate response. The focus is on understanding the persistence and breadth of the effects of such shocks to make informed decisions, which aligns with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the economy can sustain a higher utilization rate without immediate inflationary consequences due to increasing productivity. It does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains a condition under which the economy can grow without triggering inflation. This reflects a balanced view, contingent on productivity trends, and does not commit to a specific policy direction."
0,"Nonetheless, the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about a potential weakening in the housing market, which could lead to a slower economy. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract such a downside risk to the economic outlook, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly if there is a risk of inflationary pressures, indicating a stance towards preventing inflation rather than promoting easier monetary conditions. This aligns with a hawkish approach, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating the economy."
2,"Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180, 000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a steady state of employment growth, indicating that the job creation rate is consistent with past performance. It does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it reflects a continuation of existing conditions rather than a change that would warrant a policy adjustment. The FOMC may view this level of job creation as consistent with its goal of maximum employment without signaling rising inflationary pressures or economic overheating that would be associated with a hawkish stance, nor does it indicate an underperforming job market that would typically elicit a dovish response."
2,"It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who pioneered the original Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of recognition and does not provide any indication of the current or future stance of monetary policy. It merely acknowledges the contributions of former Federal Reserve Chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen in establishing the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. There is no information provided about policy direction, inflation, employment, or interest rates."
1,The implication is that monetary policy is already well positioned to slow the expansion.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current stance of monetary policy is considered sufficient to decelerate economic growth. This implies a belief that previous tightening measures are adequate to address concerns such as inflation, which is in line with a hawkish stance that aims to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members believe the risks to economic growth are balanced, which suggests that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy at the moment. This stance is neither explicitly hawkish (suggesting a need to raise interest rates to combat inflation) nor dovish (suggesting a need to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy). Instead, it reflects a view that the current policy is appropriate given the economic conditions at the time of the statement."
0,"They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity and employment levels are still recovering and have not reached the levels seen at the beginning of the year. Additionally, it mentions that weaker demand and lower oil prices are keeping consumer price inflation down. This suggests that there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so, in order to support further recovery in employment and to help inflation move towards the Committee's long-term goal of 2%. The focus on below-target inflation and under-recovered employment levels implies a stance that leans towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy."
1,"But the importance of price stability has sometimes been insufficiently appreciated in our central bank's history, and, as Allan Meltzer will soon point out, such episodes have had unfortunate consequences.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the significance of price stability and alludes to negative outcomes from historical periods when it was not sufficiently prioritized by the central bank. This suggests a stance favoring measures to ensure price stability, which typically involves tightening monetary policy to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish approach."
1,"Potentially, waiting could require more disruptive policy tightening actions later and could risk the credibility of the System's anti-inflation policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that delaying policy tightening could lead to more aggressive and disruptive actions in the future to control inflation. It suggests that immediate tightening may be necessary to maintain the credibility of the Federal Reserve's commitment to controlling inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance advocating for a tighter monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising."
2,"So we view maximum employment as the maximum sustainable level of employment, meaning it’s not so much that it will cause the economy to overheat.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on maximum employment, indicating that it aims for a sustainable level that does not lead to economic overheating. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving one of its goals without explicitly suggesting a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the Committee's focus on sustainability, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance that neither explicitly supports a hawkish (tightening) nor a dovish (easing) direction."
2,"Participants expected that productivity growth would pick up as firms slowed hiring to a pace more in line with output growth but acknowledged that the improvement might be limited, particularly if business investment spending were to remain soft.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about productivity growth and its relationship with hiring practices and business investment spending. It does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The expectation of productivity growth aligning with output growth suggests a balanced view of economic progress, while the acknowledgment of potential limitations due to soft business investment spending indicates awareness of prevailing economic risks."
2,"And obviously there are benefits from a strong economy to every household in the economy, including savers, from having a better job market and a more secure economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the broad benefits of a strong economy, including a better job market and a more secure economy for all households, including savers. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the positive outcomes associated with economic strength. This statement aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions."
0,"The strong support from monetary policy, together with fiscal stimulus, should turn the K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that delivers full employment, as Mike McCracken would have wished.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the current monetary policy, in conjunction with fiscal stimulus, is aimed at supporting a broad-based and inclusive economic recovery that achieves full employment. This suggests an easing stance, as the focus is on stimulating the economy to ensure recovery and employment growth, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The reference to a ""K-shaped recovery"" turning into a full employment scenario indicates a desire to address economic disparities and support those lagging in the recovery process, which typically involves maintaining or introducing accommodative monetary measures."
