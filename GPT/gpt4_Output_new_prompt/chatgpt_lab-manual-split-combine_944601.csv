2,Participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting a strong labor market and moderate growth in economic activity, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It reflects an observation of the economy's performance relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond to monetary policy measures aimed at boosting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects a balanced view on the tools available for managing the economy, without a clear indication of a shift towards either a more hawkish or dovish monetary policy stance."
0,Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where an investment boom led to rapid growth in labor productivity. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on economic performance, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should raise or lower interest rates or adjust its monetary policy stance to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the amount of inflation-protected securities outstanding and the ability to gauge real interest rates across different maturities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides information on how the FOMC can monitor real interest rates, which is a tool for assessing economic conditions. This information can be used in the formulation of policy but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
2,"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite the labor market being close to full employment, there are indicators of remaining slack, such as the employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation rate for prime-age workers not yet reaching pre-recession levels, and the lack of significant wage growth. This implies that there may be room for the economy to grow without causing inflationary pressures, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment and economic activity."
0,"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic observation regarding the relationship between low inflation, deflation, and their potential economic costs without indicating a specific policy action or direction. It acknowledges the challenges posed by both very low inflation and deflation but does not suggest an immediate response or change in monetary policy. The focus is on the potential impact of these conditions rather than on a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,maintaining low and stable inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""maintaining low and stable inflation"" reflects one of the core objectives of the FOMC, which is to ensure price stability. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it describes a general goal of the Committee without providing information on the current policy stance or future policy actions. The statement is consistent with the FOMC's long-term target of a 2% inflation rate and does not by itself suggest a change in policy direction."
2,"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it suggests a discussion or consideration of factors influencing inflation performance, without a clear implication for immediate policy action. It reflects a balanced view, acknowledging that the current understanding of inflation dynamics may have limitations or that there are complexities not fully accounted for."
2,"Even so, most members viewed a slowing to a rate closer to most estimates of the growth of the economy's potential as a reasonable expectation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members expect economic growth to slow to a rate that aligns with the economy's potential growth. This suggests a view that the economy is moving towards a state that neither overheats (which might require a hawkish response) nor cools excessively (which might prompt a dovish response). It reflects a balanced perspective that does not clearly signal an imminent change in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance."" This suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring economic indicators and may be prepared to act, possibly by raising interest rates, to preempt inflationary pressures or other economic imbalances, in line with their goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""asymmetric directive"" implies that there is a greater focus on the possibility of tightening rather than easing, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"So we want to see that healthy process unfold as we decide what the true state of the economy is, and we think it will evolve in a way that will mean lower inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects inflation to decrease without specifying the need for aggressive monetary policy tightening. The use of ""healthy process"" suggests a natural or gradual adjustment in the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation to foster maximum employment and stable prices. The expectation of ""lower inflation"" without a direct reference to tightening measures indicates a leaning towards a less aggressive policy approach."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies a scenario where there is less need for monetary policy tightening because the easing of supply issues itself is expected to help in achieving the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment. Therefore, the stance is dovish as it indicates conditions that could lead to a more accommodative policy approach."
2,"The slower growth of M2 followed strong expansion in August and September, however, and growth since midyear was at about the same pace as in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about the growth rate of the money supply (M2), noting that it has slowed down but is consistent with the growth rate earlier in the year. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides context on economic conditions. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest any immediate action or concern regarding the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of inflation targeting, specifically its association with improved communication and transparency to make the central bank's policy intentions clear. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the procedural aspect of how the policy is communicated. This is in line with the FOMC's commitment to transparency but does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments."
0,"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic principle regarding the negative effects of deflation, similar to those of inflation, on resource allocation and the economy's potential. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. The statement is informative about the goals of monetary policy without providing a clear direction on future policy actions."
2,"Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Broad equity prices rose, adding to their substantial gains since the middle of 2010"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely an observation of market conditions, specifically the performance of equity prices over a period. This statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to the monetary policy in response to inflation or employment levels. It is a neutral comment on market performance, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, including but not limited to monetary policy."
2,"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a return to previous conditions with retail energy prices decreasing after a temporary post-hurricane increase and consumer confidence recovering. This suggests a normalization of the economic situation without implying a clear need for a change in monetary policy stance. It does not directly suggest an action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather an observation of economic indicators that are expected to stabilize."
2,"If the FOMC were to tie mechanically our actions to market prices, then we would be placed in the sorry position of validating whatever whim that currently struck investors' fancy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the potential pitfalls of aligning monetary policy too closely with market prices, suggesting that the FOMC should not be swayed by short-term market fluctuations. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of maintaining an independent and measured approach to policy decisions. This stance is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a comprehensive assessment of economic indicators, rather than reacting to market volatility."
0,We want to see lower unemployment.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""We want to see lower unemployment"" suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is focused on reducing unemployment, which aligns with a dovish stance. This implies that the FOMC may be willing to keep monetary policy more accommodative to support job creation, even if it risks higher inflation in the short term. This dovish approach is consistent with the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment."
2,Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the extraction of equity through amortization, which is a normal financial process, rather than indicating a specific monetary policy action or stance. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide clear insights into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates. The sentence seems to be more focused on the observation of a financial behavior rather than a policy direction."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad goals that guide the Committee's actions."
2,"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests that the speaker will discuss potential economic issues such as equity price imbalances, personal saving rates, current account status, and household debt burden. These topics are important for understanding the economic context and potential risks, but the sentence itself does not reveal how the FOMC might adjust monetary policy in response to these concerns. It reflects an awareness of various economic indicators that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions, but without additional context, it does not suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"It is true that changes in longer-term interest rates in the United States—but also in other advanced economies—does have some effect on emerging markets, particularly those who are trying to peg their exchange rate, and can lead to some capital inflows or outflows.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the effects of changes in longer-term interest rates on emerging markets, particularly in relation to capital flows and exchange rate pegs. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the interconnectedness of global financial systems and the potential impact of U.S. monetary policy on other economies. This reflects an understanding of the external consequences of policy decisions without suggesting a specific policy direction."
0,"Although participants considered it unlikely that the economy would reenter a recession, many expressed concern that output growth, and the associated progress in reducing the level of unemployment, could be slow for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants are concerned about slow output growth and a potentially prolonged reduction in unemployment levels. This concern suggests a stance that leans towards easing monetary policy to support economic growth and accelerate the reduction in unemployment, consistent with a dovish approach. The focus on supporting the economy and preventing a recession aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, indicating a readiness to maintain or introduce stimulative measures if necessary."
2,"She showed there some so-called optimal policy rules that come from trying to get the best possible outcomes from our quantitative econometric models, and what you see, if you look at that, is that the best possible outcomes, assuming perfect certainty, assuming perfect foresight—very unrealistic assumptions—still involve inflation staying quite close to 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the use of optimal policy rules derived from quantitative econometric models that aim for the best possible outcomes, which include keeping inflation close to the 2 percent target. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of stable prices and does not explicitly suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of ""perfect certainty"" and ""perfect foresight"" as unrealistic assumptions indicates a recognition of the complexities in policy-making, without a clear indication of a current policy stance."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent inflationary pressures and are therefore in favor of a ""patient approach"" to adjusting the federal funds rate. This suggests that they are not inclined to tighten monetary policy in the near term, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation to stimulate the economy or prevent it from slowing down. The use of ""muted inflation pressures"" implies that inflation is not a current concern, which is consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,Participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect moderate economic growth in the near term with a slight acceleration over time. This outlook does not strongly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it portrays a stable economic situation that is neither overheating (which would be inflationary and thus HAWKISH) nor slowing down significantly (which would warrant a DOVISH response to stimulate the economy). The use of ""most likely remain moderate"" and ""pick up very gradually"" implies a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a NEUTRAL stance."
1,Economic DevelopmentsReal economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economy is growing at a solid pace, which could suggest that the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, in line with its mandate for stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. A strong expansion in real economic activity often leads to concerns about potential inflationary pressures, which a hawkish stance would aim to address."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation that national saving has increased, which has provided further impetus to economic growth. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather reports on an economic condition that could be a result of various factors. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or altering its monetary policy. The increase in national saving could potentially affect employment and inflation, but the sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether it would lead to a more hawkish or dovish policy response."
0,Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC's 2 percent target over coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect inflation to approach the Committee's long-term goal of 2 percent in a gradual manner. This expectation suggests a balanced view on the economic outlook, without signaling an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The use of the word ""gradually"" implies that the current state of inflation is not far off target, and thus the Committee may not need to adjust policy significantly in the near term to achieve its objectives."
2,"Several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long-run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time, and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy strategies, tools, and communications practices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion about the timing and context of a decision regarding the long-run composition of the Federal Reserve's portfolio, which is a part of its broader monetary policy framework. The participants' view that there is no immediate need to make a decision and that it should be considered as part of an ongoing review suggests a balanced approach without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on strategy, tools, and communication practices reflects a deliberative stance that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish."
0,labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend"" does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it describes a positive economic condition that could potentially support higher employment without leading to inflationary pressures. High labor productivity can be associated with a healthy economy, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on how this productivity trend affects the FOMC's assessment of inflation or employment, the stance remains neutral."
1,Persistently strong demand and increasingly supportive conditions in debt and equity markets suggested the possibility of rising inflation pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential rising inflation pressures due to strong demand and supportive conditions in financial markets. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that labor market conditions will self-correct over time, leading to a balance between labor demand and supply, which would naturally ease wage and price pressures. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, neither clearly signaling an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a belief in the eventual stabilization of key economic variables without explicit intervention, aligning with a neutral stance."
0,"As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation describing the impact of the pandemic on the economy, without directly indicating a future policy action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It sets the context for the economic challenges faced but does not in itself suggest a stance on how the FOMC will adjust policy in response to these challenges."
0,"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects real GDP growth to exceed potential growth due to a highly accommodative monetary policy, which would lead to a decrease in unemployment to historically low levels. This suggests that the economy is performing strongly, and there may be a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking action to increase the availability of dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions by expanding swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank, and even removing formal quantity limits. This action is aimed at easing monetary conditions by providing liquidity, which is a dovish policy stance typically associated with stimulating economic activity and supporting financial markets during times of stress. It reflects a response to a potential tightening in financial conditions that could adversely affect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a member of the FOMC is considering the implementation of more stringent criteria for inflation and unemployment before adjusting monetary policy. This suggests a bias towards ensuring inflation remains in check and unemployment does not fall too low, which could lead to an overheating economy. By setting lower thresholds, the Committee would be signaling a readiness to tighten monetary policy sooner or more aggressively to prevent the economy from running too hot, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,Many indicated that they expected cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that participants expect inflation to rise due to a tightening labor market, which typically leads to higher wages as employers compete for a smaller pool of unemployed workers. This expectation of higher inflation could prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, in line with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy."
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members do not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy due to the expectation that inflation will remain low for some time. The emphasis on the lack of urgency and the consideration of international reactions suggest a stance that leans towards maintaining or easing the current policy rather than tightening it. This dovish stance aligns with a focus on supporting economic activity and employment, as long as inflation remains below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
0,"Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members were concerned that a 50 basis point reduction in interest rates, if communicated as a response to balanced risks, might be misinterpreted as the end of the Committee's policy easing. This suggests that those members were not ready to signal a halt to monetary policy easing, implying that they were still open to further actions to stimulate the economy if necessary. The use of policy easing (reducing interest rates) is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it aims to support economic activity, potentially at the expense of higher inflation in the short term. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, indicating a readiness to act against economic slowdowns."
0,"Given the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, there is a dispute on how widely productivity implicit in the information revolution has spread across the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in measuring productivity increases by industry and the extent to which the information revolution has affected productivity across the economy. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexities of economic measurement, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a positive trend in the unemployment rate but also expresses caution by noting that this improvement might be overstated due to a decline in labor force participation. This suggests a balanced view that neither clearly indicates a need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of the complexities in interpreting labor market indicators, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,"However, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite some improvements, there are still signs of underutilization in the labor market, with a low labor force participation rate, a presence of discouraged workers, and individuals working part-time for economic reasons. Additionally, it mentions low rates of hiring and quits, which are indicators of labor demand. This suggests that the labor market is not overheating and there may be slack, implying that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to cool down the economy. The FOMC might use this information to justify maintaining or introducing more accommodative policy measures to support maximum employment, one of their key goals."
2,"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the nature of policymaking as a complex and uncertain process. It neither suggests an intention to raise nor lower interest rates, nor does it comment on the current state of employment or inflation relative to the Committee's goals."
2,"In the near term, the 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation, as measured by the 12-month change in Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices, will rise above the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that there may be upward pressure on prices, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too high, in line with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical development in technology and its impact on the coordination of train movements, which is unrelated to the current monetary policy stance or the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's current views on monetary policy tightening or easing."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation rates being persistently below the FOMC's 2% target, which could lead to lower long-term inflation expectations. The mention of ""makeup"" strategies suggests that some economists are advocating for measures that would allow inflation to rise above the target for some time to compensate for previous periods of below-target inflation. This approach is dovish as it implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily and suggests a potential easing of monetary policy to boost inflation to the desired level."
2,"With regards to inflation, the median inflation projection of FOMC participants is 2.4 percent this year and declines to 2 percent next year before moving back up to 2.1 percent in 2023.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a projection of inflation rates that are close to the FOMC's target of 2%, with a slight overshoot in the current year and a return to target in the following year. This suggests that the FOMC sees inflation as relatively controlled and does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The projection implies that the current policy stance may be appropriate to maintain inflation around the target level, without signaling an immediate need for a policy adjustment."
2,"The role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context about the organizational structure of the Federal Reserve System and does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy. It refers to the balance of centralized and regional responsibilities within the Federal Reserve, which is more about the institutional framework rather than an immediate policy direction. The sentence does not provide information on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it discuss current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"payroll employment posted solid gains, and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there have been solid gains in payroll employment and a general improvement in the utilization of labor resources, suggesting a tightening labor market. This could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The statement aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but also hints at the need to balance this with the goal of stable prices, which could require a hawkish stance if employment gains are strong."
2,"But even for many other workers, a rapidly evolving work environment in which the skill demands of their jobs are changing can lead to very real anxiety and insecurity about losing their jobs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a social and labor market issue regarding the anxiety and insecurity workers feel due to the rapidly changing skill demands of their jobs. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges a nonmonetary factor that could potentially impact employment, which is one of the FOMC's concerns. However, without a clear link to policy actions or intentions to adjust the federal funds rate, the sentence remains neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
1,"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to preventing inflation, which could undermine economic expansion and efficiency. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve price stability, which is one of the FOMC's primary goals. The focus on containing inflationary forces typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent overheating."
0,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker is comfortable with a tight labor market despite inflation being below the 2% target, implying that there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance leans towards supporting employment, even at the risk of lower inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses fiscal policy rather than monetary policy, focusing on the management of budget and trade deficits through government spending and taxation. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, nor does it provide information on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it does not suggest a hawkish or dovish monetary policy stance."
2,"Instead, I would like to address a separate but not unrelated topic, the interaction of bank supervision and regulation with monetary policy, and how supervision and regulation might work to make monetary policy implementation more effective in the current environment, particularly as it relates to a bank's demand for reserves.2 But first, let me start with a brief take on the current economic outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a discussion on how bank supervision and regulation can interact with and potentially enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy implementation. This reflects a focus on the operational aspects of policy execution rather than a shift in policy direction."
1,Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve's goal is to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies measures to control inflation and potentially slow down growth to maintain stability. The concern mentioned about the Treasury's actions potentially conflicting with the Fed's objectives further underscores the Fed's intent to maintain or increase interest rates to achieve its goals."
2,"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a challenge in evaluating the current level of economic slack and acknowledges uncertainty due to differing indicators of excess demand. It does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a complex economic environment that the FOMC must consider. This reflects a balanced approach, as the FOMC is weighing various factors before making a policy decision."
2,Communications about monetary policy over the intermeeting period generally had little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the market's reaction to the FOMC's communications, stating that there was little effect on Treasury yields or the expected path of the federal funds rate. This indicates that the communications were likely perceived as consistent with current expectations and did not signal a clear shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced or status quo situation regarding the FOMC's stance on monetary policy."
0,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low"" suggests that expectations for future inflation are subdued, as reflected in financial markets. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and it may even open the door for easing if the FOMC is concerned about too-low inflation relative to its target. The dovish stance is consistent with a policy that would support economic growth and employment, as long as inflation expectations remain anchored around the Committee's long-term goal."
2,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have reached a consensus to maintain the current stance of monetary policy without any changes. This suggests a balanced approach, neither tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy at the time of the meeting. It reflects a decision to hold steady and suggests that the current policy is in line with their objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without the need for immediate adjustments."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there may be a need for more tightening overall, an accelerated pace of tightening is not deemed necessary at the moment. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for some tightening (which could be seen as hawkish) but also recognizing factors that allow for a more measured pace, such as economic slack, productivity growth, and contained inflation (which could be seen as dovish). The Committee is weighing the risks and appears to be taking a middle ground, neither signaling an immediate tightening of policy nor indicating a move towards easing."
2,"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about potential imbalances growing during an unsustainable economic boom, which could lead to rising inflation and necessitate sharply higher interest rates to counteract these effects, potentially causing a recession. This indicates a stance towards preventing inflationary pressures by being open to tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. The focus on preventing an unsustainable boom and the willingness to raise interest rates to combat inflation align with a tightening bias to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
1,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a noticeable increase in both short- and long-term inflation expectations according to survey measures. Rising inflation expectations can signal a potential for actual inflation to rise, which may prompt the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
0,"In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the U.S. dollar has appreciated against the currencies of Advanced Foreign Economies (AFEs), which is attributed to the divergence in monetary policy expectations between the United States and AFEs, as well as political uncertainty in Europe. A stronger dollar in this context suggests that investors expect tighter monetary policy (e.g., higher interest rates) in the United States compared to AFEs, which is typically a hawkish stance. Tighter monetary policy can be used to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The appreciation of the dollar could also affect the FOMC's other goals, such as maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence specifically points to expectations of a divergence in policy, which is more often associated with a hawkish outlook."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting improvements in the labor market and moderate economic activity, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the economy's performance relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that monetary policy has been effective in stabilizing inflation, which suggests that the actions taken (likely tightening measures) have been successful in achieving one of the FOMC's key goals: stable prices. This indicates a stance that is supportive of maintaining or possibly increasing the tightness of monetary policy to ensure that inflation remains stable, aligning with a hawkish perspective."
0,The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a forecast of economic indicators, specifically unemployment and inflation rates, without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It indicates an expectation of progress towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not explicitly state whether the FOMC will respond with tightening or easing measures. The projection itself is neutral, as it simply outlines anticipated economic conditions."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a statement about economic growth, which could be influenced by various factors, including past monetary policy actions. However, without additional context on how the FOMC views this growth in relation to inflation and employment, it is not clear whether this would lead to a hawkish or dovish response. The sentence could be seen as positive news that might lead to a hawkish stance if the growth is associated with rising inflation pressures, or it could remain neutral if the growth is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic behavior, noting that despite strong profit growth, there has been a modest recovery in capital expenditures, leaving a significant portion of cash buildup unexplained. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of current economic conditions, which the FOMC might use to inform its policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should raise or lower interest rates or adjust its monetary policy stance to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"More than two years after the recession trough, and following several quarters of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that, based on historical patterns, the Federal Reserve would typically have already begun tightening monetary policy in response to several quarters of strong growth following a recession. This suggests that there may be an expectation or rationale for the Fed to start implementing measures to prevent the economy from overheating, which aligns with a hawkish stance that favors increasing interest rates to control inflation and stabilize the economy."
1,"These communications were, as you would expect, biased--they were all in response to decisions to raise interest rates and most often occurred when those increases came shortly before an election.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical pattern of communication in response to interest rate increases, particularly around election times, but does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy action. It is more of a commentary on the timing and context of past communications rather than a clear indication of a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the adequacy of current techniques to measure inflation in the future, which is a methodological issue rather than a direct indication of the current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather points to the challenges in monitoring one of the key indicators that inform policy decisions."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the role of inflation in promoting financial innovation in Brazil, which helped firms and households reduce their need for cash. It does not directly indicate a current stance on U.S. monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide clear guidance on future policy actions by the FOMC. It is merely an acknowledgment of the impact of inflation on financial behavior in a different country's context."
2,Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are in a state of observation and are not committing to either tightening or easing monetary policy at this moment. They are expressing vigilance regarding inflation and global economic conditions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This stance suggests that they are waiting for more information before deciding on any policy changes."
1,Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports on the actions of foreign central banks without directly indicating the Federal Reserve's stance on its own monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease the monetary policy by the FOMC but rather provides context on the global economic environment. The FOMC may consider such information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy direction in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC decided against tightening monetary policy preemptively based on forecasts due to uncertainties about empirical relationships. This suggests a cautious approach, favoring the avoidance of potentially unnecessary restrictive measures that could hinder economic growth or employment, aligning with a dovish stance that is less aggressive in fighting inflation and more supportive of economic expansion."
1,"Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for high inflation and suggests that the nominal federal funds rate should not be below near-term inflation expectations. This implies that the FOMC may consider raising the federal funds rate to combat inflation, which is a tightening of monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to stabilize prices, one of the FOMC's key goals."
0,"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and non-energy import prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the Committee's target, suggesting that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. The reference to external factors like declines in energy and non-energy import prices as reasons for low inflation implies that the current monetary policy could remain accommodative or even be eased to help push inflation towards the target level. This stance aligns with a dovish approach, which is generally supportive of lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity and move inflation towards the desired goal."
2,The trimmed mean measure of 12-month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained at or near 2 percent in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that a specific measure of inflation, the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, has been stable at or near the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is neither accelerating beyond the target, which would be a concern for the FOMC and might warrant a hawkish response, nor falling significantly below the target, which might prompt a dovish response to stimulate the economy. The stability of this inflation measure at the target rate implies that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining the inflation goal, and there is no clear indication from this sentence alone that a change in policy stance is necessary."
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target, suggesting that if inflation has been persistently below this level, the Committee is prepared to allow it to run moderately above 2 percent for some time to balance out the average. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, reflecting a hawkish stance. The focus on anchoring expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability shows a proactive approach to managing inflation, which is often associated with a hawkish policy when inflation is below target."
1,Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most major indexes of equity prices moved up sharply on the bullish economic reports"" is simply a statement of fact regarding market reactions to economic reports and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide information on their balance of risks regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral observation of market conditions without an explicit link to the FOMC's policy actions or intentions."
0,"In their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting, participants reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary conditions. This is in line with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with policies that are aimed at stimulating economic activity, such as lowering interest rates or purchasing assets, to achieve maximum employment and price stability, especially during challenging times."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to foster conditions that lead to stable prices and sustainable economic growth. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes the overall goals of the Committee. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide specific information on the actions the FOMC might take to adjust monetary policy in response to economic conditions."
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic conditions and factors that have led to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar, such as higher U.S. interest rates, expectations of tax reform, and actions by foreign central banks. It does not directly indicate a future stance of the FOMC on monetary policy, whether tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on the international financial environment that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. The statement is factual and does not suggest a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments."
1,"In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight and that inflation was far above the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants recognize a very tight labor market and inflation levels significantly above their 2 percent target. This suggests a concern for overheating in the economy, which typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to cool down inflation and align it with the Committee's objectives."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a defensive stance regarding the FOMC's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of considering both inflation and employment in their decision-making process. The statement is a response to criticism and a reminder of the balanced approach the FOMC takes in fulfilling its objectives, without a clear directional signal on policy adjustments."
1,"But the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term, especially if labor markets tightened further.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are worried about potential inflationary pressures arising from tighter labor markets in the intermediate term. This concern suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an unwanted increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, with the aim of keeping inflation in check."
2,"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the modeling of the term structure of interest rates and how these models fit better when assuming changes in inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic modeling and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor provides a clear direction on the future path of monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the dynamic nature of economic factors and the central bank's responses, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of being informed by a range of indicators and adjusting policy as necessary."
2,"Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So, what happened?"" does not provide any clear indication of a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It seems to be the beginning of a discussion or analysis rather than a statement of policy stance. The sentence could be leading into an explanation of economic conditions that might inform the FOMC's decisions, but without further context, it does not suggest a particular direction in monetary policy. It is neutral as it does not directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a clear response to deviations from these goals."
0,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges a positive economic development (solid productivity growth) that could support both price stability and maximum employment in the long term. However, it does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response to this observation. The sentence suggests that the productivity gains are more structural than cyclical, which could have implications for long-term policy but does not convey an immediate stance on policy adjustments."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is monitoring various economic indicators, including monetary aggregates (like money supply), their velocities (how quickly money circulates), and overall economic and financial developments, to assess progress toward their goal of price level stability. This approach suggests a balanced and data-driven stance, without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on evaluating these factors in relation to their goals of stable prices suggests a commitment to their mandate but does not signal a specific policy direction."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where technological advances in biotechnology are leading to productivity improvements across various sectors. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic developments that could influence productivity and, potentially, long-term economic growth. It is neutral because it does not explicitly suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy stance in response to these advances. The FOMC might view such productivity gains as beneficial for the economy without necessitating a change in policy in the short term."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members anticipate that an increase in employment could lead to slower productivity growth, which in turn might result in higher unit labor costs and upward pressure on prices. This scenario implies a risk of inflation, which could necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Therefore, monetary policy in Japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies,","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It discusses the consideration of how monetary policy in Japan might be affected by views on its impact on macroeconomic performance, given fiscal policies. This reflects a general statement about policy considerations without a clear indication of a stance towards hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not anticipate a significant change in inflation, suggesting that they might not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The expectation of ""slight further disinflation"" implies a small decrease in the inflation rate, but since no material change is expected, the stance is neither clearly hawkish nor dovish. It reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to discuss the impact of rising asset prices on the economy, suggesting that there could be a positive contribution from such an increase. However, it does not directly indicate a clear stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. The sentence could imply that if asset prices are rising, it might signal an improving economy, which could eventually lead to a more hawkish stance if inflation concerns arise. Conversely, it could also suggest that the rise in asset prices is helping to support the economy, potentially reducing the need for immediate policy action. Since the sentence does not explicitly mention any intent to adjust monetary policy in response to the change in asset prices, it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy in the context of global financial flows. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather considers the potential challenges that globalization might pose to the traditional mechanisms of monetary policy. The focus is on the influence of cross-border capital flows on domestic interest rates, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy direction."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering international economic factors as part of its forecasting process. This does not directly suggest a move to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows a comprehensive approach to understanding the economic environment. The focus on international developments is part of the balanced assessment of risks and does not inherently signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies an expectation of slow economic growth, which typically leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. In this context, the FOMC might lean towards easing policies to stimulate demand and support economic activity, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the projection for core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation has been raised due to higher recent readings, which suggests that inflation is trending higher than previously expected. This could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract rising inflation and align with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices with a 2% inflation target over the long term. Raising inflation projections often signals concern about inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a decrease in headline inflation due to falling energy prices, which suggests that inflationary pressures are easing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or reducing interest rates to encourage economic growth and employment."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical economic cycles and the causes of downturns, specifically noting that financial imbalances, rather than inflation in goods and services, were elevated at those times. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of past events. This statement is more analytical and does not indicate a clear stance on the current monetary policy direction."
0,The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of the pandemic on the economy, noting its unprecedented nature and the resulting unemployment and economic shock. It does not directly indicate a future stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides context for the economic environment in which the FOMC is operating. The statement is factual and does not suggest a specific policy direction, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members were considering an easing of monetary policy to support financial markets and mitigate risks to economic growth. Easing policy typically involves lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors more accommodative monetary policy to support employment and growth when there is no significant inflationary pressure."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation expectations are low, which suggests that investors anticipate low inflation in the future. This could imply that there is less pressure on the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there might be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic growth and employment. Low inflation expectations are often associated with a dovish monetary policy stance, as they provide central banks with more flexibility to maintain or lower interest rates to stimulate the economy."
2,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that current negotiations for wages and prices are incorporating expectations of future inflation. This suggests that there is an anticipation of inflationary pressures, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is a hawkish stance, as it aims to curb inflation and maintain price stability, which is one of the FOMC's primary goals."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumers' inflation expectations are either decreasing or are at historically low levels. This suggests that inflation pressures may be less than previously anticipated, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, lower inflation expectations could reduce the need for immediate action to increase interest rates, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real interest rate in the context of productivity trends. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it describes a scenario where fiscal policy (government spending and surplus) could influence the equilibrium real interest rate, which is a factor the FOMC might consider when making monetary policy decisions. The sentence suggests a balancing effect on the real interest rate due to fiscal conditions, which does not inherently signal a move to either raise or lower the federal funds rate."
2,"Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered in shorter time frames, or improved in quality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of entrepreneurs in a market economy, using market prices to gauge consumer demand and improve products and services. It does not directly indicate any stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it does not reflect a hawkish or dovish stance but rather remains neutral with respect to monetary policy."
2,The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance towards either tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. It suggests a balanced perspective without signaling a clear move to adjust monetary policy in either direction."
1,"With inflation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the current inflation rate is significantly higher than the federal funds rate, which means that in real terms (after adjusting for inflation), the rate is negative. This suggests that the FOMC recognizes the need to raise the federal funds rate further to combat high inflation and move towards a positive real interest rate, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve their goal of stable prices."
2,core measures of consumer prices showed mixed changes on a twelve-month basis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""core measures of consumer prices showed mixed changes on a twelve-month basis"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that there is variability in inflation indicators, which could mean that the FOMC might not see a clear path to either increase or decrease the interest rates based solely on this information. The mixed data would likely lead to a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the current policy stance until a clearer trend in inflation emerges."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative stance on monetary policy for an extended period, even after the conclusion of the asset purchase program and as the economic recovery gains strength. This suggests a commitment to easing monetary policy to support employment and stabilize prices, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes economic growth and employment over immediate concerns about inflation."
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a theoretical viewpoint on market efficiency and asset pricing, rather than directly indicating a current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather presents a perspective on how markets might function in theory. This does not directly relate to the FOMC's immediate policy actions or goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the rapid pace of investment is contributing positively to the economy by expanding productive capacity, which helps to contain inflationary pressures. This suggests a balanced view where current economic conditions are seen as neither excessively inflationary nor deflationary, and thus does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an economy that is growing in a way that aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates without explicitly suggesting a change in policy stance."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that rising oil prices are expected to lead to higher consumer energy prices, which could contribute to inflation. This scenario may prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,they noted that inflation had been persistently below 2 percent during the current economic expansion and that core inflation on a 12-month basis was little changed in recent months at a level below 2 percent.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been consistently below the FOMC's target of 2 percent, suggesting that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support economic expansion and help push inflation towards the target level."
2,"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has made significant changes to its policy statement, enhancing its forward guidance on the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and providing detailed information about its policy reaction function. This suggests a proactive stance in adjusting policy tools to manage economic conditions, which could include tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target or to address other economic imbalances. The mention of ""upgraded our forward guidance"" and ""unprecedented information about our policy reaction function"" implies a commitment to transparency and potentially a readiness to act, which can be interpreted as a hawkish signal, especially if these changes are made in response to concerns about inflation or financial stability."
2,The effect of higher energy prices on real incomes was likely still restraining consumer spending.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that higher energy prices are having a negative impact on real incomes, which in turn is likely reducing consumer spending. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds that could lead to lower inflationary pressures or even deflationary risks. In this context, a dovish stance would be more likely as the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract the negative impact on consumer spending and support the economy. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to fostering maximum employment and stable prices."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed correlation between the decline in term premiums and the decrease in long-run inflation uncertainty as well as short-term interest rate uncertainty since 1990. This statement is primarily analytical, reflecting on past economic conditions and trends without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on market conditions and uncertainties that may inform the FOMC's decisions."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that economic activity is stronger than expected and that inflation pressures may be increasing. This indicates a potential need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Because equity valuations may pose asymmetric risks to the economic forecast, the implied optimal responses of policy to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential risks that equity valuations pose to the economic forecast and suggests that the policy response to changes in asset prices may be nonlinear, which means it could vary depending on the situation. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of the relationship between asset prices and monetary policy decisions. It reflects a balanced view that policy may need to adapt in different ways to different situations, without committing to a specific direction of policy adjustment."
0,"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is not only currently low but also expected to decrease slightly in the near future. This suggests that there is less concern about overheating in the economy, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a low and potentially falling inflation rate would not warrant a hawkish stance, and could even open the door for easing if there is a need to support employment or stimulate economic activity."
1,"Household spending was projected to grow at a fairly solid rate, supported by higher employment and somewhat lower energy prices but damped somewhat by lessened stimulus from gains in wealth and the need for households to rebuild savings.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a balance of factors affecting household spending, with positive aspects like higher employment and lower energy prices, and negative aspects like reduced wealth gains and the need to rebuild savings. This balance suggests that the FOMC sees both supportive and restraining forces on economic activity, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The mention of ""higher employment"" aligns with the goal of maximum employment, while the absence of direct references to inflation or interest rate pressures does not suggest a strong shift in policy stance."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about core inflation being ""uncomfortably high,"" which suggests they believe inflation is above the target level. The emphasis on the ""importance of further moderation"" implies that the Committee may be inclined to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down to their target, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes combating inflation even if it could potentially slow down economic growth or increase unemployment in the short term."
2,The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the Federal Reserve's role in maintaining price stability, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms the Fed's overarching responsibility."
2,"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the FOMC members expressing readiness to adjust policy in response to signs of either rising inflation or a weakening economic expansion. This suggests a stance that is neither explicitly geared towards tightening nor easing but rather emphasizes vigilance and flexibility in response to economic developments."
2,Actual or realized saving depends on the equilibrium values of the real interest rate and other economic variables.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a fundamental economic concept without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that actual saving levels are determined by the real interest rate and other economic variables, which is a neutral observation and does not suggest any immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,That means that we can run at low levels of unemployment and have a historically good—in some dimensions—labor market without having to worry about inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy can sustain low levels of unemployment without triggering inflationary pressures. This suggests that the FOMC does not see an immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports employment growth and may favor maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the slow growth of monetary aggregates (such as money supply) indicates that the current monetary policy is not too stimulative or loose. This suggests that there may be less need for further easing, and it leans toward a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent potential inflation or overheating of the economy, aligning with a hawkish view."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where interest rates are rising quickly, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The concern about not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve is anticipating the consequences of a higher interest rate environment, which could be due to efforts to control inflation or other economic factors that warrant a reduction in monetary stimulus. The mention of potential problems with congressional response indicates an awareness of the broader implications of such a policy stance."
1,"These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargentâ€™s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the potential for a high-inflation equilibrium, which suggests a focus on preventing or combating higher inflation. This concern aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies the need for tighter monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And we’re learning to, to engage in economic activity"" does not provide any clear indication of the direction of monetary policy. It does not suggest any action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It seems to be a general statement about economic behavior rather than a comment on monetary policy stance."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to keeping the federal funds rate at a very low level until specific conditions related to employment and inflation are met. This suggests a policy stance that is supportive of economic growth and is not looking to tighten monetary policy until there is clear evidence of sustained employment levels and inflation targets being achieved. The reference to allowing inflation to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time also implies a tolerance for higher inflation, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
0,"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees the public health crisis as a negative factor impacting economic activity, employment, and inflation, suggesting that the economy is facing headwinds. This view is dovish because it implies that the FOMC may be inclined to implement or maintain an accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and counteract the adverse effects mentioned. The mention of ""considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term"" further reinforces the likelihood of a dovish approach to ensure that the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices are not jeopardized by the ongoing public health crisis."
0,So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the distributional effects of unemployment rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather acknowledges a socioeconomic issue related to the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
1,"Putting It All Together I would now like to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in figure 6.7 To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of the factors contributing to the U.S. trade deficit, suggesting a balanced approach to understanding economic conditions without implying immediate action to adjust monetary policy. The focus on the trade deficit and its causes is more descriptive of the economic situation than prescriptive of policy changes."
2,"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about the natural rate of unemployment, which is a theoretical concept representing the lowest level of unemployment that can be sustained without causing inflation to rise. It does not directly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an inquiry into understanding the labor market dynamics, which is part of the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment. This understanding helps the FOMC to set policy that is consistent with its long-term goals, but the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate policy action."
0,The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of reduced pressures on resources and a moderation in core price inflation due to a period of slower economic expansion. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy and possibly more room for easing to support economic growth. The mention of ""appreciable easing of pressures on resources"" aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there may be slack that monetary policy could address to support the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that certain measures of inflation (trimmed price indexes) are aligning with the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation target of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is neither too high nor too low, which could imply that the current monetary policy stance is effectively steering inflation towards the desired level. The sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"That sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the August employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its ""soft patch. ""","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is recovering from a period of weakness, as indicated by Federal Reserve officials' comments and the August employment report. This perception of economic improvement could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures that might arise from a strengthening economy, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The use of the term ""soft patch"" implies that the period of weaker economic activity is ending, which could reduce the need for a dovish policy stance aimed at stimulating the economy."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat"" suggests that expectations for future inflation have decreased, which could imply that there is less pressure on prices to rise. This could be interpreted as a sign that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there may be less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could mean that the Committee might lean towards maintaining or lowering interest rates to support economic activity, as long as inflation is not a concern, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that inflation is expected to remain high unless there is a significant increase in aggregate demand, which the members do not currently anticipate. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to close the gap between actual and potential output, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target over the long term. Tightening monetary policy is a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation."
0,Consumer price inflation had remained relatively subdued over the summer months.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation has been relatively low during the summer months. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not strong, which could imply that there is less urgency for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, subdued inflation aligns with the target of stable prices and might reduce the need for immediate policy action to raise interest rates."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic condition (large current account deficits due to vigorous domestic imports) without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a potential concern for the future but does not indicate a clear stance on adjusting the monetary policy to address this issue. The focus is on the trade balance rather than directly on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC."
1,"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market-based measure of inflation expectations (inflation compensation from TIPS) that has increased but is still aligned with historical norms (pre-pandemic levels). This observation does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it suggests that inflation expectations are stable. The FOMC might view this stability as consistent with their long-term inflation target, without necessitating an immediate policy response."
2,"Headline stock price indexes in the AFEs generally ended the period higher, whereas bank stocks in Europe declined.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply reports on the performance of stock price indexes and bank stocks, which does not directly suggest a need for tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC would consider such information as part of the broader economic context but it does not directly relate to their stance on monetary policy in terms of achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that inflation is running below the target level, which could suggest that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the FOMC's 2% long-term goal. A ""prolonged shortfall of inflation"" indicates that the FOMC may consider easing policies to address the lower-than-desired inflation."
2,"In hindsight, the paths of inflation, real output, stock prices and exchange rates may have seemed preordained, but no such insight existed as we experienced it at the time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on economic conditions without providing a clear direction on future monetary policy actions. It acknowledges the unpredictability of economic indicators such as inflation and output, which the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, but it does not indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Consumer price inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective of 2 percent, restrained in part by earlier decreases in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is below the Committee's target of 2 percent, partly due to lower energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports. This suggests that there is less upward pressure on inflation, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy and possibly more room for easing to stimulate the economy and move inflation towards the target."
1,"And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And maybe reducing their level of the natural rate of unemployment, which has been the trend."" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about a trend in the natural rate of unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is a concept related to the level of unemployment that the economy can sustain without causing inflation to rise, and a reduction in this rate could be interpreted in various ways. It could suggest an improving labor market, which might eventually lead to inflationary pressures (a hawkish implication), or it could imply a reassessment of labor market dynamics that does not immediately warrant a policy change (a neutral implication). Without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this trend, the stance remains neutral."
2,"The productivity boom after the Civil War resulted from a variety of technological advances, including the expansion of and improvements in the use of steam power, railroad transportation, and communication by telegraph.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical economic developments related to technological advances and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on factors that can influence economic productivity."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment continued to expand through July and the civilian unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an update on employment conditions, indicating that nonfarm payroll employment has been growing and the unemployment rate has remained stable. This information by itself does not clearly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it reflects a situation where employment is expanding without a change in the unemployment rate. It suggests that the economy is maintaining its course with respect to employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals, but does not provide information on whether the FOMC would see a need to adjust policy in response to these conditions."
0,"These participants cited, for example, the still-elevated levels of long-term unemployment and workers employed part time for economic reasons as well as low labor force participation.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights concerns about high levels of long-term unemployment, part-time workers who would prefer full-time work, and low labor force participation. These issues suggest that the economy is not at full employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. Therefore, the statement leans towards a dovish stance, indicating that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to support employment."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, indicating no significant change in the economic conditions or outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent tightening or easing of policy, thus it is best classified as neutral."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives and statutory mandate. The sentence does not indicate a shift towards a more aggressive or accommodative stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2018 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine process of the FOMC, where members submit their economic projections based on their judgment of appropriate monetary policy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions and setting policy. The focus is on the methodology and the practice of forecasting, without revealing a bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The uncertainty about the threshold unemployment rate also suggests a differing degree of intensity in the response of monetary policy to deviations of inflation and output to their respective targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty about the level of unemployment that might prompt a change in monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC's response to inflation and output deviations from targets could vary. This reflects a balanced approach, as it does not clearly signal an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather to remain adaptable depending on economic indicators. It shows a commitment to flexibility and a data-dependent stance, which is consistent with a neutral policy position."
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the economy can sustain a higher utilization rate without triggering inflation, due to increased productivity. This statement is neutral because it does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply explains a condition under which the economy can grow without causing inflation, which is in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The sentence also implies that this balance could change if productivity growth changes or wage bargaining adjusts, but it does not indicate a current policy stance."
2,That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the nature of foreign trade deficits, suggesting that they tend to correct themselves over time without implying any immediate action for monetary policy adjustments. This statement is more descriptive of economic theory than prescriptive of policy action, and it does not specifically relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015,","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply provides a historical data point regarding the impact of net exports on GDP growth in 2014 and 2015. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is a neutral observation and does not reflect a clear direction in terms of the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the members of the FOMC acknowledge that real short-term interest rates are at a level that could be considered restrictive, which implies that the current monetary policy is tight. A restrictive monetary policy is typically associated with higher interest rates to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on preventing the economy from overheating and keeping inflation in check, consistent with their goal of stable prices."
2,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, particularly concerning inflation and employment, as the world economy reopens after a disruptive event (likely the COVID-19 pandemic). This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity and unpredictability of the current economic environment. The FOMC is signaling that it is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to adjust policy as needed, but it is not committing to a specific direction at this time."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the influence of monetary policy and cyclical factors on the short end of the yield curve. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the role that monetary policy plays in influencing interest rates, particularly at the shorter end of the yield curve, without suggesting any specific policy action."
0,"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the expectations of real short-term interest rates without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It reflects a change in long-term projections rather than an immediate policy stance."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an external event (the outbreak) on economic activity and financial markets without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges disturbances but does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing measures. The focus is on the observation of conditions rather than a policy stance."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement reflecting on past achievements of the Federal Reserve in controlling inflation. It does not directly indicate any current or future policy action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the historical performance of the Federal Reserve in achieving one of its goals, which is stable prices with a long-term inflation target of 2 percent."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of being informed about developments that could impact the Federal Reserve's ability to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a balanced approach, focusing on monitoring economic indicators and being prepared to adjust policy as needed to meet long-term goals."
1,"The first is what to do about supply shocks, like large increases in oil prices, which tend to increase both inflation and unemployment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario of supply shocks, such as significant increases in oil prices, which can lead to higher inflation and unemployment. This statement is simply acknowledging a challenge that the FOMC faces without indicating a specific policy action or direction. It does not explicitly suggest whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing monetary policy, as the appropriate response could depend on the context and the balance of risks between inflation and unemployment. Supply shocks can have ambiguous effects on monetary policy decisions, as they can lead to both inflationary pressures (which might warrant a hawkish response) and economic slowdowns (which might warrant a dovish response)."
1,"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of economic conditions, noting that there has been growth in consumer spending and exports, which contributed to the expansion of economic activity. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide a clear signal about the Committee's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate. The statement is simply reporting on recent economic developments without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy adjustments."
1,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects an acknowledgment of past forecasting errors regarding economic growth but does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor easing of monetary policy, but rather a neutral observation on economic projections."
2,"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical observation about the simultaneous attainment of low unemployment and inflation levels, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely acknowledges a past condition without suggesting a particular direction for policy adjustments."
2,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that banks can sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates, which implies that the FOMC might be comfortable with raising interest rates without causing undue harm to the banking sector. Higher interest rates are typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy, aimed at controlling inflation and stabilizing prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the establishment of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which in itself does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a planning and regulatory measure that aims to ensure monetary stability and growth within a set framework. The targets are broad enough to accommodate various economic conditions, and without additional context on the prevailing economic situation or the reasons for choosing these specific ranges, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. It appears to be a neutral action in the context of managing monetary supply to support the FOMC's broader goals."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while core inflation rates are currently below the FOMC's 2% target, there is an expectation that inflation will stabilize around the target level due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests a balance between concerns about current inflation levels and confidence in future inflation dynamics, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The Committee appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
0,The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an external economic assessment by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) regarding the impact of fiscal policy on GDP growth and unemployment. It does not directly indicate the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's decisions. The statement is factual and does not suggest a specific monetary policy action, such as tightening or easing, by the Federal Reserve itself. It acknowledges the influence of nonmonetary factors (fiscal policy) on the economy, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of considering a range of indicators and balancing risks when making policy decisions."
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technological advancement in terms of the cost of computing power, which is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a direct indication of monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement acknowledges a positive trend in technology cost efficiency, which could potentially impact productivity and economic growth, but it does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a change in policy to achieve these goals."
0,"that is, the capacity utilization rate is lower than would have been expected, based on past experience, at the prevailing unemployment rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about the relationship between capacity utilization and the unemployment rate, suggesting that the current capacity utilization is lower than what would typically be expected given the current unemployment rate. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions. It reflects an analysis of economic indicators, which is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. Therefore, the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their target of 2% inflation over the long term. The authorization and direction to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions likely refers to operations that would align with a tightening stance, such as selling securities or raising the federal funds rate, to temper the robust economic expansion."
2,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. Therefore, the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their target of 2% inflation over the long term. The authorization and direction to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions likely refers to operations that would align with a tightening stance, such as selling securities or raising the federal funds rate, to temper the robust economic expansion."
0,"Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Following these swings, inflation was expected to finish the year at just below 2 percent."" suggests that inflation is projected to be near the FOMC's target rate of 2%. This indicates a situation where there is neither a pressing need to tighten monetary policy aggressively (which would be hawkish) nor to ease it (which would be dovish). The expectation of inflation being just below the target suggests a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals, without a clear bias towards either tightening or easing policy."
2,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,"" does not provide enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide information on their views regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates. The sentence merely acknowledges a discussion about the effects of monetary policy on asset prices, which is a common topic of consideration for central banks. Without additional context on the nature of the effects or the intended policy response, the stance cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
2,"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a hypothetical scenario where the economy is assumed to be at an ideal state, with full employment and inflation at target levels. It does not indicate any particular action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather sets a baseline for discussion or analysis."
2,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the technical aspects of economic measurement rather than directly suggesting a stance on monetary policy. It discusses the importance of clear and consistent definitions for measuring productivity and standards of living, which is a foundational concept in economics but does not indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of considering the time lag between policy implementation and its effects on the economy, and it reflects a balanced approach to achieving the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the need for forward-looking decision-making based on projected economic conditions."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The expectation of a prolonged downturn in a specific sector implies that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are currently significant imbalances in the economy, including in the labor market, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without leading to persistent inflationary pressures. This indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of the economy and does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but does not yet see a need to adjust policy in response to these imbalances."
2,"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the economic growth and emerging problems in Asian economies without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy, but rather provides context or background information relevant to the global economic environment."
2,"The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there are multiple factors (monetary ease, fiscal stimulus, productivity gains, and improved business confidence) that are expected to provide a strong boost to spending. This could lead to increased inflationary pressures, which might require the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. The mention of ""considerable monetary ease"" implies that the current policy is already accommodative, and the anticipation of ""significantly more fiscal stimulus"" could mean that the FOMC might lean towards a less accommodative stance (i.e., a hawkish tilt) in the future to balance the effects of these stimulative factors."
2,"However, economic activity continued to be depressed in areas affected by the downturn in the energy sector and falling agricultural commodity prices, al­though several participants noted that the recent firming in crude oil prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific economic condition related to the energy sector and agricultural commodity prices, and it notes both negative and positive developments. The mention of ""economic activity continued to be depressed"" could suggest a dovish tilt, as it indicates weakness in certain sectors. However, the observation that ""the recent firming in crude oil prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity"" implies a slight improvement, which could counterbalance the negative aspect. Overall, the sentence does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of certain economic conditions. The FOMC might use such information to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy direction."
2,"Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the potential for inflationary pressures due to higher energy and other costs, which could suggest a hawkish stance if these pressures were deemed significant. However, it also notes that core inflation has been relatively low in the recent past and that longer-term inflation expectations are contained, which could imply a dovish stance if the FOMC believes these trends will continue. The combination of these two observations suggests a balanced view, with the FOMC recognizing both upward and downward risks to inflation but not committing to a policy shift in either direction. This reflects a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be weighing the risks of inflation against observed trends without indicating a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of the housing market, noting improvements in activity and a rise in house prices, but also acknowledges variability across regions. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reports on economic conditions without suggesting an immediate need for policy adjustment. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring various economic indicators, which can inform future policy decisions, but in itself, it does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
2,"This difficulty of forecasting inflation has important implications, as we shall see.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of predicting inflation, which is a factor the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. The statement is preparatory and does not commit to any specific policy action, thus it is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are concerns about potential lower-than-expected inflation (downside risks), the majority view is that the risks to the inflation outlook are evenly balanced between upside and downside risks. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone, reflecting a neutral stance."
2,"in contrast, however, overall business investment in equipment and software was projected to strengthen in response to the upward trend in replacement demand, especially for computers and software","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of increased business investment in equipment and software due to rising replacement demand, particularly for computers and software. This statement is a neutral observation about economic conditions, specifically regarding business investment trends, and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an aspect of economic activity but does not suggest an immediate response or adjustment in monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a neutral observation about the volatility of short-term economic indicators, such as gasoline prices, which can fluctuate and affect inflation measures. It does not directly suggest a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the variability in economic factors that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions."
1,"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive employment situation with millions of new jobs created and a low unemployment rate that has been sustained over two years. This information on its own does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states the employment conditions, which are one aspect of the FOMC's dual mandate. The statement does not provide information on inflation or the Committee's response to the employment situation, so it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish without additional context."
0,"The recent lower readings on inflation have been driven significantly by what appear to be one-off reductions in certain categories of prices, such as wireless telephone services and prescription drugs.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that recent lower inflation figures are attributed to specific, possibly temporary price reductions in certain sectors, rather than a broad-based decline in prices. This suggests that the observed deflationary pressures might not warrant a tightening of monetary policy, as they may not represent a sustained trend. The FOMC might therefore lean towards maintaining or easing the monetary policy stance to support maximum employment and stable prices, in line with their long-term inflation target of 2%."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an ongoing discussion about the adequacy of the unemployment rate as a measure of labor resource utilization. This suggests that the FOMC is considering various indicators to assess the labor market, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving maximum employment, one of their key goals. The sentence does not commit to any specific policy action, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where reduced mortgage interest rates are balancing out the negative impact of declining financial wealth on housing demand. This indicates that the FOMC is observing both positive and negative economic factors without suggesting a clear direction for policy adjustment. The mention of ""appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates"" could imply a previous easing action, but the overall tone of the sentence is balanced, reflecting neither a clear intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy further. It simply states an observation of the current economic conditions related to housing activity."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for an extended period, even after the conclusion of its asset purchase program and once the economic recovery has gained strength. This suggests a commitment to easing monetary policy to support employment and stabilize prices, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes stimulating economic growth and potentially tolerating higher inflation in the short term to achieve long-term objectives."
0,A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a supportive stance towards fiscal measures and suggests that monetary policy will be used to promote economic recovery and achieve the Committee's goals of inclusive employment and price stability. This implies a willingness to maintain or introduce measures that ease monetary conditions to support the economy, which is consistent with a dovish policy stance."
1,"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months,","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Consumer prices had edged up in recent months"" suggests that there has been an increase in inflation. Given the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and targeting a 2% inflation rate over the long term, an increase in consumer prices could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further. This could involve increasing the federal funds rate or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is considering the effects of climate change and associated policies as factors in its decision-making process to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges an additional consideration in their policy framework. It reflects a balanced approach to incorporating new information and risks into their policy assessments without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there was excessive risk-taking and overextension of credit in the late 1990s, which suggests that the FOMC might see a need to tighten monetary policy to prevent such overshooting. Tightening would be consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to control potential inflationary pressures and maintain financial stability by curbing overly optimistic credit expansion."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges factors that can affect the economy, such as election outcomes and oil prices, but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on uncertainties implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices without suggesting any immediate action to adjust the policy stance."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate is intended to offset an increase in the real federal funds rate due to a recent decline in inflation. This suggests a balancing act rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC appears to be making an adjustment to keep the real federal funds rate stable, which aligns with their goal of maintaining moderate long-term interest rates and stable prices, without necessarily indicating a shift towards a more aggressive monetary policy stance."
2,"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory statement that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It simply indicates a transition in the discussion to the topic of monetary policy without offering insights into whether the policy will be tightened, eased, or remain unchanged."
0,"So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect effects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the effects of lower interest rates, which could be a result of previous dovish actions, but it also mentions ""indirect effects"" without specifying what those are or how they might influence future policy decisions. The statement seems to be describing the current state of affairs rather than signaling a future policy stance."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The mention of underutilization implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support the labor market and stimulate economic activity, without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally in favor of lower interest rates and other expansionary monetary policies to support employment."
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to reducing monetary accommodation and a decisive response to data with the aim of controlling inflation. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to ensure the credibility of the FOMC's inflation targets, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the impact of weak foreign demand on the value of the dollar, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It neither indicates an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on international economic factors that could influence the FOMC's decision-making."
2,"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of macroeconomic stability and does not directly indicate a current or future action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that low long-term interest rates are typically associated with a stable macroeconomic environment, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The sentence does not provide specific information on whether the FOMC is inclined to adjust the monetary policy to be more accommodative or restrictive, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that many participants believe potential output growth could be stronger than the staff's estimates. This optimism about economic growth could lead to a tighter monetary policy stance if the participants expect that higher output growth might lead to inflationary pressures, which would need to be countered by raising interest rates or taking other measures to prevent the economy from overheating. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could suggest a leaning towards tightening to maintain price stability."
2,But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects uncertainty or complexity in interpreting how asset prices affect the broader economic outlook, which does not suggest a clear policy action. It implies a balanced view, acknowledging the challenges in assessing economic indicators, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,A widespread view that the Federal Reserve would take whatever steps were needed to hold down inflation over time probably had contributed to the persistence of subdued long-run inflation expectations during an extended period when rapidly rising demand was pressing on limited supply resources.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, suggesting that the Fed is willing to take aggressive measures to control inflationary pressures. This stance typically involves tightening monetary policy, which can include raising interest rates. The reference to ""whatever steps were needed"" implies a readiness to act decisively against inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability even in the face of rising demand and limited supply, which could otherwise lead to higher inflation."
2,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had changed little on balance"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the expectations of inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a situation where the FOMC might not see the need to adjust its policy stance aggressively in either direction, as long-term inflation expectations are stable and aligned with their target."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the challenges in predicting economic outcomes, which is a neutral position in terms of policy direction. The focus here is on the difficulty of making accurate forecasts, not on a specific policy action to be taken."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the impact of policy measures on unemployment statistics without directly suggesting a future course of action for monetary policy. It indicates that emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have influenced labor force participation and unemployment rates, but it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on understanding the labor market dynamics rather than signaling a change in monetary policy stance."
2,"This conclusion is buttressed by recent sizable increases estimated for labor productivity for the manufacturing sector, derived from a data system that, for the most part, is independent of the national accounts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of increased labor productivity in the manufacturing sector, which is a factor that can influence monetary policy but does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing. Higher productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily increasing inflation, which might not require a change in monetary policy. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Survey measures of expected future inflation were fairly stable,"" suggests that expectations regarding future inflation are not changing significantly, which implies that there may be no immediate need for a change in monetary policy stance. It indicates neither a clear sign of inflationary pressures that would warrant a tightening of policy (hawkish) nor deflationary concerns that would suggest a need for easing (dovish). The stability in inflation expectations is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the sentence does not lean towards any action to either raise or lower interest rates."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decline, reaching levels that are potentially below the natural rate of unemployment. This could lead to upward pressure on wages and inflation, suggesting that the FOMC might need to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. A projection of declining unemployment rates aligns with the goal of maximum employment but also signals vigilance against potential inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a significant drop in unemployment, inflation has not increased as might be expected. This suggests that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is weaker than previously thought, which could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation. The Committee members' estimates moving down suggests they are recognizing a lower risk of inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing monetary policy rather than tightening it."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a perception of downside risks to both economic activity and inflation projections, suggesting that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates or tighten monetary policy. This dovish stance implies a potential for easing to support economic activity and to prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
1,Several participants reported that business contacts had expressed growing concerns about the increase in their input costs and that there were signs that an increasing number of firms were seeking to pass on these higher costs to their customers in the form of higher prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is growing concern among businesses about rising input costs, and firms are attempting to pass these costs onto customers through higher prices. This suggests inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""There’s a lot more demand for risk sharing, for liquidity services, and so on."" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an observation about market conditions, specifically an increased demand for financial services related to risk management and liquidity. This does not inherently suggest a move towards raising or lowering interest rates or adjusting monetary supply, which are the typical actions associated with hawkish or dovish stances, respectively. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine how the FOMC might respond to this increased demand in terms of its policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where housing activity decreased but then showed signs of recovery due to falling mortgage rates. This indicates a mixed or balanced view of the economy, with no clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might see this as a sign that previous policy adjustments are having their intended effects on the housing market, which is an important economic sector, but the statement does not explicitly suggest an imminent change in policy stance."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards not tightening monetary policy (raising rates) solely based on low unemployment figures unless there is accompanying inflation. This suggests a tolerance for lower unemployment without preemptive rate hikes, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes supporting employment and is less concerned with immediate inflationary pressures, as long as they remain within target levels."
0,"Indeed, some expressed the concern that, with the persistence of considerable resource slack, inflation might run below mandate-consistent levels for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation might remain below the levels consistent with the FOMC's mandate due to considerable resource slack (i.e., underutilized economic resources). This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to prevent inflation from falling too far below the target level, which aligns with a dovish stance. The dovish stance is typically associated with lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity and push inflation towards the target."
2,"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it discusses the possible interpretations of congressional behavior regarding inflation targeting, which could be seen as either a lack of support or simply an absence of strong opinions. This does not provide clear guidance on the direction of monetary policy adjustments, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tolerance for inflation levels moderately above the 2% target, which suggests that the FOMC may not feel an immediate need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to bring inflation down to the 2% target. However, the acceptance of higher inflation can also be interpreted as a willingness to maintain or increase interest rates to prevent inflation from rising too much, which is a hawkish stance. The statement reflects a commitment to allowing some inflation for the sake of supporting employment, but it also implies vigilance against the risk of inflation becoming too high, which would necessitate a tightening of policy."
2,"The Survey of Market Participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a shift in expectations following the release of the new monetary policy framework.17 The median expected rate of unemployment at the time of liftoff moved down from 4.5 percent in the July survey, before the release of the framework, to 4.0 percent in the September and subsequent surveys, following the release of the new framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a change in market participants' expectations regarding the unemployment rate at which the Federal Reserve might begin to raise interest rates (referred to as ""liftoff"") following the release of a new monetary policy framework. The shift in expectations from a 4.5 percent to a 4.0 percent unemployment rate does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects an adjustment in market perceptions based on the new framework. The sentence does not provide information on whether the Federal Reserve will act in a hawkish or dovish manner but simply reports on observed changes in expectations."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC members are not ready to tighten monetary policy due to weaker labor market conditions and uncertainty about inflation. Waiting for more information before starting policy normalization (which typically involves raising interest rates to prevent inflation) implies a stance towards maintaining or easing the current policy rather than tightening it. This dovish stance aligns with the goals of supporting employment and ensuring that inflation moves towards the target rate in a stable manner."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework, without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Discussion of Communications Regarding Economic Projections As a follow-up to the FOMC's discussion in October about providing more information on the Committee's collective judgment regarding the economic outlook and appropriate monetary policy, the staff presented several options for enhancing the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's consideration of ways to improve the transparency of their economic projections and policy judgments. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on communication strategies. The discussion of enhancing the SEP is about providing clearer information, which is a procedural matter rather than a direct indication of policy direction."
2,"Members also agreed that their evaluation of progress on their objectives would take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to evaluating progress towards its goals by considering a broad set of economic indicators. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (neither tightening nor easing) but rather outlines the comprehensive and balanced manner in which the Committee assesses economic conditions. This reflects a commitment to data-driven decision-making without a predetermined bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Those few members who expressed a preference for easing at this meeting believed that, with unit labor costs and inflation expectations contained, enough evidence of further weakness already existed to warrant an immediate action.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some members of the FOMC were in favor of easing monetary policy because they observed contained unit labor costs and inflation expectations, alongside evidence of economic weakness. This suggests a preference for a more accommodative policy stance to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. Easing policy could help in achieving maximum employment and stimulating economic activity without stoking inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals when inflation is under control."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will adjust its asset purchase program based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced approach, where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further data. The statement reflects a readiness to adapt to changing economic conditions in pursuit of their goals, without a clear direction towards either increasing or decreasing monetary stimulus."
2,"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors are leading to an improvement in exports, which is generally positive for the U.S. economy. However, it does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The improvement in exports could potentially lead to higher economic growth and employment, aligning with the FOMC's goals, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate need for a policy change. It simply provides an observation of current economic conditions without a direct implication for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a research finding on the relationship between U.S. short-term interest rates and euro area bond yields, rather than directly indicating a current or future stance of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide a clear indication of the FOMC's stance on achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence is more about the transmission of U.S. monetary policy effects on international markets rather than a direct comment on the policy itself."
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is slower growth in final spending leading to inventory overhangs, which is an observation of current economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an economic development that the FOMC might take into consideration when making future policy decisions."
2,"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the relationship between equity price movements and investment spending, which is more of an analytical question rather than a direct statement on monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather reflects a consideration of how external economic factors (such as equity prices) might influence economic activity and potentially inform future policy decisions."
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it highlights the importance of business spending as a determinant of economic activity, which is a factor the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The focus on business spending suggests that the FOMC is monitoring economic indicators to inform future policy moves, but it does not reveal a clear intent to either increase or decrease the federal funds rate or adjust monetary policy."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is planning to adjust policy in a way that is consistent with its long-term objectives of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. The use of ""balanced approach"" suggests that the Committee is neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) but is aiming to strike a balance between the two to achieve its goals. This implies a careful consideration of the economic conditions without a clear indication of moving in a specific direction (tightening or easing)."
0,"So on the first, the Committee’s forecasts and those of most outside forecasters do show growth running below its longer-run potential this year and next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the growth is expected to be below its longer-run potential, which suggests a recognition of slower economic activity but does not directly imply an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear stance on changing the monetary policy direction."
2,"Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a state of uncertainty regarding inflation expectations, which suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging the unpredictable nature of economic indicators and is likely to continue monitoring the situation before committing to a specific policy action. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach that neither signals an immediate intent to raise interest rates (hawkish) nor a clear inclination to lower them (dovish)."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic slowdown is partly temporary and anticipates greater growth in the future. This implies an expectation of economic recovery without the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to encourage economic growth. The sentiment expressed does not indicate a concern for rising inflation that would necessitate a hawkish approach."
0,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a general principle regarding the relationship between money growth, inflation, and the business cycle without indicating a current policy direction. It suggests that a stable rate of money growth could theoretically control inflation and stabilize the business cycle under certain conditions, but it does not commit to any immediate action or change in policy. The statement is more of an observation about monetary theory rather than a signal of a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that despite low unemployment leading to higher wages, companies are not passing these costs on to consumers through higher prices, which suggests that inflationary pressures are not intensifying. This could indicate that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports accommodative policy measures to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factor contributing to economic growth in the past quarter and anticipates a change in that factor for the current quarter, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an analysis of economic conditions, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stance."
0,"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that central banks, in reaction to a slowdown in economic activity and a decrease in inflationary pressures, have taken measures to ease monetary policy significantly. This easing could involve lowering interest rates or implementing other expansionary monetary policies to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and is generally less concerned with high inflation in the short term."
1,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the increase in oil prices has had only a modest impact, suggesting that the situation does not currently warrant a significant change in monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing, but rather implies a wait-and-see approach as the effects of oil price changes are not causing major disruptions."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. economic activity has been revised upward, which suggests a more positive outlook on the economy. However, without additional context on how this revision compares to the Committee's goals for employment and inflation, or how it might influence the FOMC's monetary policy decisions, it is not clear whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral as it simply reports an updated economic forecast without a clear directional implication for monetary policy."
2,Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the balance of various factors that are influencing market sentiment, including both negative (increasing coronavirus cases) and positive (improving economic data and policy support) developments. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC but rather acknowledges the mixed economic signals that the Committee must consider. This reflects a balanced or unclear stance on the direction of future monetary policy."
1,"However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated, with the 12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has risen more than expected, with the PCE price index reaching a 12-month change of 3%. This suggests that inflation is above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the target level. A higher-than-anticipated inflation rate typically prompts a hawkish response, as the FOMC may consider increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from spiraling further."
2,"1 The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' projections for economic variables in the long run, assuming an ""appropriate"" monetary policy and no new economic shocks. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather a state of equilibrium that the economy is expected to reach under suitable conditions. The use of the term ""appropriate"" suggests a policy that is neither particularly hawkish nor dovish but one that is balanced and aimed at achieving the FOMC's long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion about the operational aspects of implementing monetary policy through open market operations, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a procedural aspect of how the Federal Reserve conducts its policy rather than a stance on the policy itself."
2,"Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It expresses uncertainty or lack of clarity regarding the relationship between monetary policy, maximum employment, and stable prices. This suggests a balanced or uncertain stance rather than a commitment to either a more hawkish or dovish policy direction."
2,the effect of prior changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar on core consumer prices had apparently been limited.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about the limited impact of currency exchange fluctuations on core consumer prices, without suggesting a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions rather than a policy stance."
2,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the release of mortgage price data and concerns about equal access to credit, which is more related to financial regulation and fairness in lending practices rather than direct monetary policy actions such as adjusting the federal funds rate or changing the stance on inflation or employment. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural step in the FOMC's meeting process, focusing on discussing economic conditions and policy implementation without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's routine consideration of economic data and policy options, which is a standard part of their decision-making process."
2,"It isn’t really just targeting the headline numbers, but it’s about taking all of those things into account in your thinking about what constitutes maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a balanced approach to defining maximum employment, indicating that the FOMC considers a range of factors beyond just headline employment figures. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather an inclusive and thoughtful analysis of employment data to inform policy decisions. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to making well-informed decisions based on a comprehensive view of the labor market, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic environment with strong performance and credit availability that supports the growth of innovative enterprises. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of the economic conditions. The focus on a conducive environment for business growth aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment and stable prices, but without explicit policy direction, the stance remains neutral."
2,"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a period in which monetary policy was aligned with the Taylor Rule, a formulaic approach to setting the federal funds rate based on economic conditions, but notes that the nominal federal funds rate remained roughly constant. This suggests a balance between adjusting policy in response to economic indicators and maintaining stability in the interest rate, which does not clearly indicate a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In addition, some of the correlation may reflect the effect of the response of monetary policy to exchange rate developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between monetary policy responses and exchange rate developments without indicating a clear direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It suggests that the FOMC is aware of the impact of exchange rates on the economy and is considering this in their policy decisions, but it does not provide information on whether they are inclined to move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The focus is on the interaction between policy and exchange rates rather than a commitment to adjust the policy in a specific direction."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. This sentence does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a change in market perception. The sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy action or direction, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there is an expectation of reduced stimulus (which could be seen as HAWKISH), this is expected to be offset by other factors such as low long-term interest rates and diminishing energy-related issues (which could be seen as DOVISH). The balance of these factors implies a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be neither signaling a clear move towards tightening nor easing monetary policy, but rather expecting different economic forces to equilibrate."
2,"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It merely states a fact about the scarcity of information regarding price and nominal wage expectations from businesses. This lack of data could potentially make it more challenging for the FOMC to assess inflation pressures accurately, but the sentence itself does not suggest a clear action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's ongoing assessment and data-gathering process, which is a neutral and regular part of their approach to achieving their goals."
2,"Financial markets seem to think the sameâ€”5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates.6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the market's inflation expectations are aligned with the FOMC's long-term target of 2%, suggesting that current inflation pressures are seen as temporary. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly signal a need for immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy, as the market expects inflation to stabilize around the target level in the long run."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the limitations of the Federal Reserve's authority, specifically what it cannot do in terms of directing funds to specific entities or purposes. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather clarifies the scope of the Fed's powers. This statement is more about the legal and operational constraints of the Fed rather than its current monetary policy stance."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of how interest rate changes impact various economic factors such as asset prices, household wealth, exchange rates, net exports, and import prices. It also compares the effects of short-term rate changes with balance sheet policies, noting that the influence of the federal funds rate is better understood due to extensive historical data. This statement does not explicitly indicate a direction for future monetary policy but rather describes the mechanisms through which monetary policy operates. It reflects a balanced view on the tools of monetary policy without suggesting an immediate need for either tightening or easing."
0,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants expect certain inflationary pressures (energy prices and rents) to stabilize or decelerate in the future. This expectation does not clearly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as these factors evolve. The statement reflects a balanced view on inflation—one of the key concerns of the FOMC—without signaling a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is closely monitoring inflation trends and expectations, which is a standard part of their mandate to ensure price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows a commitment to vigilance regarding one of their key goals. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to policymaking, where decisions are made based on incoming data."
0,"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the value central bankers place on credibility in the context of disinflation costs but does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a general statement about central banking principles rather than a specific policy direction."
2,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, which suggests a continuation of the existing monetary policy stance rather than a shift towards tightening or easing. This indicates a balanced approach, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making any significant policy changes."
1,"In these circumstances, any tendency for price pressures to mount was likely to emerge only gradually and to be reversible through a relatively limited policy adjustment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that price pressures are expected to rise slowly and can be managed with minimal policy adjustments. This implies that the FOMC does not see an immediate threat of high inflation that would require a significant tightening of monetary policy. The use of ""only gradually"" and ""relatively limited policy adjustment"" indicates a stance towards easing or at least not aggressively tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish outlook."
1,Participants' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC have grown more concerned about inflation, which typically suggests a bias towards tightening monetary policy to control rising prices. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates to achieve their target inflation rate of 2% over the long term. Increased concern about inflation often leads to a hawkish stance as the committee seeks to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation expectations well-anchored."
0,"A few members observed that, in their judgment, current and prospective economic conditions--including elevated unemployment and inflation at or below the Committee's objective--could warrant the initiation of additional securities purchases before long.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members believe that the current and expected economic conditions, which include high unemployment and inflation at or below the target level, could justify further quantitative easing measures, such as the purchase of additional securities. This suggests a leaning towards an easing of monetary policy to support economic activity and employment, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
2,This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past assessment of inflation forecasting without directly indicating a future policy action or change in stance. It acknowledges an unexpected outcome in inflation trends, which is part of the FOMC's regular analysis and does not inherently suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to tolerate a higher inflation rate in exchange for a lower unemployment rate, which indicates a preference for easing monetary policy to support employment. This dovish stance implies a focus on the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, even at the potential cost of allowing inflation to rise above the target level temporarily."
2,"If this high-pressure management inadvertently carried the economy beyond its productive potential, some cost in terms of inflation could be expected,","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that an overly aggressive monetary policy could lead to the economy operating above its productive capacity, which would likely result in increased inflation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating the economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish view."
2,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of a return to solid growth and a solid labor market, which does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a general positive outlook on the economy's future performance, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not provide specific guidance on policy adjustments."
2,"First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""First, with more complete information available, markets will price financial assets more efficiently."" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a principle related to market efficiency and the role of information in financial decision-making. It does not provide insight into the FOMC's current or future monetary policy actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants in the FOMC have adjusted their views on the appropriate path for policy due to a slower projected path for global growth and some tightening in credit conditions. This suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary policy stance to address potential risks associated with slowing growth and tighter credit conditions, which could be inflationary or could affect financial stability. The mention of an increase in spreads implies concerns about financial markets that could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent economic overheating or financial imbalances."
0,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation regarding stock prices in relation to the economic conditions of the time. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy. Instead, it reflects on the relationship between market perceptions and underlying economic realities, which is a neutral statement in the context of current monetary policy stance classification."
2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about financial imbalances potentially becoming more closely associated with the business cycle due to a combination of a low neutral interest rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation. The statement implies that while monetary policy might not be the only tool to address these issues, there is an acknowledgment of the risks that financial imbalances pose to the economy. This recognition could lead to a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent such imbalances, which is in line with a hawkish approach to ensure stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The mention of using ""tools other than monetary policy"" does not negate the hawkish tone, as it still reflects a proactive stance on preventing potential financial instability."
2,"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the current risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, which suggests that they do not currently see a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The mention of monitoring inflation developments closely does not inherently suggest a leaning towards a more hawkish or dovish stance but rather indicates vigilance and readiness to adjust policy if necessary to maintain their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is prepared to tighten monetary policy if the economy shows signs of overheating and inflation rises to an undesirably high level. This suggests a willingness to increase interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes the control of inflation over stimulating economic growth."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence lists various factors that can influence the economy and monetary policy decisions but does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an understanding that the FOMC considers a wide range of economic indicators when making policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Monthly increases in nonfarm payroll employment averaged nearly 180, 000 over the three months ending in November, in line with the average pace of job creation over the past year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a steady state of employment growth, indicating that the job creation rate is consistent with past performance. It does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it reflects a continuation of existing conditions rather than a change that would warrant a policy adjustment. The FOMC may view this level of job creation as consistent with its goal of maximum employment without signaling immediate concerns about inflationary pressures or economic overheating that would be associated with a hawkish stance, nor does it indicate underperformance or economic weakness that would suggest a dovish stance."
0,"Inflation pressures remain muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of their historic ranges.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is not a current concern, as it remains ""muted"" and the long-term expectations for inflation are low. This suggests that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would be more accommodative to support employment and economic growth."
1,Business contacts in a few Districts reported that they had begun to have some more ability to raise prices to cover higher input costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that businesses in some districts are starting to pass higher input costs onto consumers by raising prices. This suggests an environment where inflationary pressures are present, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a recognition of the risks associated with very low (zero or negative) inflation rates, which could suggest a bias towards avoiding such scenarios by potentially tightening monetary policy to keep inflation within the target range. This stance aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices and could indicate a willingness to raise interest rates to prevent inflation from falling too low."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are labor shortages in several districts, which can lead to upward pressure on wages as businesses compete for qualified workers. Higher wages can contribute to inflationary pressures, which may prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could indicate a hawkish stance if such pressures are deemed significant enough to warrant action."
1,"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been expanding at a good pace, which implies that there is not much slack (unused capacity) in the economy. This could lead to inflationary pressures, and therefore, it might be necessary to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to slow down the expansion to maintain stable prices, aligning with their goal of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, showing that the FOMC is attentive to inflation trends, which is consistent with their mandate for stable prices. The commitment to monitoring suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed, but the sentence itself does not reveal a bias towards either increasing or decreasing the interest rate or implementing other monetary policy measures."
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of technological advancements on the definition and measurement of money, and how this has affected the relationship between monetary policy and economic activity. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the challenges that innovations pose to the traditional mechanisms of monetary policy implementation. The mention of structural changes in mortgage finance also reflects an observation of the evolving economic landscape without a clear directional policy implication."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the frequency of the Chairman's testimonies before Congress and does not provide any information on the direction of monetary policy. It neither indicates a tightening nor an easing of policy, nor does it offer insights into the FOMC's stance on employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations regarding the foreign trade component of the economy, with both exports and imports projected to rise due to various factors. It concludes that the net effect on real GDP from the external sector would likely be neutral. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the trade balance's impact on economic growth."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms the Committee's ongoing commitment to its dual mandate."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the equilibrium real rate in the context of long-term economic balance, considering factors like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of understanding a fundamental economic concept that guides policy decisions. The equilibrium real rate is a theoretical construct that helps the FOMC gauge the appropriate stance of policy over the long run but does not in itself suggest an immediate policy action."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation is not widespread across the economy, which suggests that the FOMC might not see a need for aggressive policy action either way. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of the current state of inflation. This could be interpreted as the FOMC taking a wait-and-see approach, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation rates are close to the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining price stability. There is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease the monetary policy based on this information alone, as the inflation rates are near the desired level."
2,"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the history of the European Central Bank (ECB) and does not provide any indication of the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy, nor does it offer insight into the current economic conditions or the FOMC's policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the potential effects of globalization on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather poses a question about the broader impacts of globalization. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not directly relate to immediate policy actions but rather to an understanding of economic dynamics that could inform future decisions."
2,"These indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resilience of the financial system in the face of increased volatility and falling asset prices, without directly suggesting a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It indicates that the financial system has been able to withstand shocks without significant funding stress, which is a positive sign for stability but does not in itself indicate a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
1,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence reflects a hawkish stance because it acknowledges the economic pain caused by previous actions to slow down the pace of economic activity in order to reduce inflation. This suggests a willingness to endure short-term economic difficulties to achieve the long-term goal of price stability, which may imply support for tightening monetary policy if necessary to control inflation."
1,"And I really don’t have much for you other than to say that they will be data dependent—that, over time, the stance of policy will be adjusted to try to keep the economy on a track where we see continuing progress toward achieving our goals of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will adjust its policy stance based on economic data to maintain progress towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a balanced approach that could either tighten or ease monetary policy depending on future economic indicators, without a clear direction towards either hawkish or dovish policy at this time."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, indicating that the market's long-term inflation expectations (inflation compensation) have not significantly changed. This observation does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance but rather indicates stability in market expectations regarding inflation. The FOMC might view this stability as consistent with their inflation goals, suggesting no immediate pressure to adjust policy in response to changing inflation expectations."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical assumptions about productivity growth and labor force growth, which are factors that can influence the FOMC's decisions but do not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past conditions that were considered stable and predictable, which could be part of the broader context in which the FOMC makes its decisions."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an educational statement that describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate and does not provide any specific information on current or future monetary policy actions. It does not indicate a leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the purpose of the Fed's monetary policy."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation."" suggests that while wages are increasing, the purchasing power of those wages is being offset by inflation. This statement does not clearly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges an existing condition of the economy that the FOMC might consider when making decisions, but it does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects the ongoing challenge of balancing between supporting employment (through wage increases) and maintaining stable prices."
0,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy has not yet achieved the goal of maximum employment, which is one of the FOMC's key objectives. This suggests that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support further job growth, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance. The dovish implication is that the FOMC may lean towards easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it until maximum employment is approached."
2,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, focusing on the dual mandate of dealing with inflation and unemployment. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to consider both variables in decision-making. This reflects a commitment to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,Participants commented that an increase in inflation from recent rates could have especially adverse effects on longer-run economic performance.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern among FOMC participants that rising inflation could negatively impact the economy over the long term. This concern typically indicates a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent or counteract higher inflation, aligning with the goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish action as it often involves increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down inflationary pressures."
1,"In this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about potential inflationary pressures, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an increase in inflation. This aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy is a typical response to rising inflation risks, which is considered a hawkish stance."
0,Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it describes a general economic observation that stable growth and long-term planning are beneficial for a country's fiscal health. This statement does not provide specific guidance on the direction of interest rates or other monetary policy tools and thus is considered neutral in terms of policy stance."
2,such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there are ongoing uncertainties regarding labor market dynamics and the sustainable potential growth of the economy. This reflects a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexities and unknowns in the economic environment, which suggests a cautious approach to policy-making but does not commit to a specific direction of policy adjustment."
0,"also, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of U. S. exports for some period ahead.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""also, continued solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the growth of U.S. exports for some period ahead"" does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation of positive economic conditions that could support U.S. export growth. This statement is more of an economic outlook rather than a clear stance on monetary policy adjustments. It does not explicitly suggest actions to be taken by the FOMC regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish policy stance."
0,"The members recognized that a typical recovery-period surge in consumer spending was unlikely inasmuch as expenditures had registered solid growth through the economic downturn, implying an absence of significant pent-up demands.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation by the FOMC members that a surge in consumer spending, which is common during economic recovery periods, may not occur because consumer spending remained strong even during the downturn. This suggests that there is no significant pent-up demand to drive a post-recession spending boom. The statement does not directly imply an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic situation regarding consumer spending. It reflects a balanced view without a clear indication towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October"" suggests a strengthening labor market, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. This could imply a need for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to slow down economic growth and keep inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
0,"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite economic strengthening, job growth remains weak and there is considerable slack in the labor markets. This suggests that the FOMC may be more inclined to maintain or introduce measures to stimulate the economy and improve employment levels, rather than tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on underperformance in employment suggests that the FOMC might prioritize measures to boost job creation, consistent with its goal of maximum employment."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations, as measured by the breakevens from inflation-indexed bonds, have decreased. This could suggest that the market anticipates lower inflation in the future, which might be seen as a result of previous tightening measures or as a justification for maintaining or possibly increasing the tightness of monetary policy to ensure that inflation expectations remain anchored around the FOMC's target. A hawkish stance is generally concerned with preventing inflation from rising too high, and this sentence implies that current or past policy measures are effectively managing inflation expectations."
0,"Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is subdued and has not increased, even when considering core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy items). This suggests that inflationary pressures are not building in the economy, which could imply that there is less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat rising inflation. A dovish stance is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to support economic growth when inflation is low and not a current concern."
2,"Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) present evidence of a strong correlation between fiscal deficits and money creation in high-inflation economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about research findings regarding the relationship between fiscal deficits and money creation in high-inflation economies. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC, such as tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely provides context or background information that could be used to inform policy decisions."
1,"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that delaying the adjustment towards the neutral interest rate could lead to negative outcomes such as excessive inflation or financial instability. This implies a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy sooner rather than later to prevent such risks, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where household spending is strong despite an economic downturn, suggesting resilience in that sector, but it also acknowledges potential limitations on future growth in spending. Additionally, it mentions competitive pressures that could limit profits, investment, and equity prices. This reflects a balanced view of the economic situation, with both positive and negative aspects, without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests caution and a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,Some participants noted that communications about the appropriate path of policy would be a focus of market participants in the current environment and commented that it would be important to emphasize that the Committee's reaction function or commitment to its monetary policy framework had not changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are aware of the market's focus on their communication regarding the future path of monetary policy. They stress the importance of conveying that their approach to making policy decisions (reaction function) or their overall monetary policy framework remains consistent. This statement does not directly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes transparency and consistency in their policy approach. It reflects a balanced stance, as it neither signals a clear move towards more aggressive rate hikes (hawkish) nor towards rate cuts or increased monetary accommodation (dovish)."
2,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the FOMC's decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate was expected by market participants and did not cause significant market movement. This suggests that the FOMC's action was in line with market expectations and did not signal a clear shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of ""extended period"" language indicates a commitment to maintaining the current policy stance for a foreseeable time, which is consistent with a neutral policy position aimed at fostering the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a change in policy direction."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is prepared to continue or expand its asset purchase programs and use other policy tools to stimulate the economy if there is not a substantial improvement in the labor market, provided that price stability is maintained. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further to support employment, which aligns with a dovish stance that prioritizes economic growth and job creation, even at the potential risk of higher inflation. The reference to ""price stability"" ensures that such measures would be taken with consideration for their inflation mandate, but the emphasis on labor market improvement indicates a bias towards accommodative policy actions."
2,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes characteristics of certain exchange rate regimes without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply explains that a currency board and dollarization represent more binding forms of fixed exchange rate systems, which would make it more expensive to abandon. This statement does not directly suggest any action or stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC. It is more of a factual statement about exchange rate mechanisms rather than a comment on current economic conditions or policy directions."
0,"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a statement about the complexity of productivity growth, which is a factor in the overall economic situation but does not in itself suggest a specific monetary policy action. The FOMC might consider productivity growth in its assessments, but this sentence does not reveal a clear direction for policy change."
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both headline and core inflation are expected to remain low and stable, with little change from previous forecasts. This suggests that there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that would support maintaining or easing current monetary policy to encourage employment and economic growth, as long as inflation remains under control."
1,wholesale prices edged up in March relative to their level of a year earlier and posted the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that wholesale prices have increased compared to the previous year and marks the first annual increase since a specific date in the past. This could be interpreted as a sign of rising inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might respond to with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. An increase in wholesale prices can lead to higher overall inflation if passed on to consumers, which the FOMC may counteract by raising interest rates or taking other contractionary measures."
2,"And those don’t—those, frankly, don’t carry significant implications in the long run for the—for inflation or for the American economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the factors being discussed do not have significant long-term implications for inflation or the overall economy. This indicates a view that the current situation does not warrant a change in monetary policy to either tighten or ease conditions, as there is no perceived impact on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The statement reflects a balanced perspective that neither anticipates the need to counteract inflation (which would be hawkish) nor suggests concerns about economic weakness that would require stimulative measures (which would be dovish)."
0,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that credit availability, combined with low housing prices, is enabling people to purchase more house than they could in the past. This suggests an easing condition in the housing market, which could be indicative of a broader monetary policy stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate borrowing and economic activity. The dovish stance is aligned with efforts to support maximum employment and economic growth, as easier credit conditions can help to boost demand in the economy."
2,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent,"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding global inflation expectations and does not provide information on the FOMC's intended actions to adjust monetary policy. It neither suggests imminent policy moves to counter high inflation (which would be hawkish) nor indicates a need to stimulate the economy due to low inflation (which would be dovish). Instead, it reflects an observation of the current state of inflation forecasts without a clear directional policy implication."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand. This action would be in line with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent inflation from rising above the Committee's long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
2,"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, which are typically expansionary monetary policy actions, the expected stimulative effect on the economy or prices might be limited because the banking system is not functioning normally, and banks may be reluctant to lend. This implies that there may be room for a more accommodative policy stance to encourage lending and stimulate economic activity, as the current measures are not having the intended impact."
0,"So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential overheating in the labor market due to a prolonged period of highly accommodative (easy) monetary policy. The speaker is worried that if the economy remains strong and risks do not materialize, the labor market could become too tight, which might lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the speaker is considering the need for future tightening of monetary policy to prevent such an outcome, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although real growth was likely to be moderate in coming quarters, in his view it was unlikely to be slow enough to bring core inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite expecting moderate real growth, the speaker believes it will not be sufficient to reduce core inflation. This implies a concern for persistent inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a low federal funds rate is being used to stimulate economic growth and reduce slack in resource utilization, which suggests a policy stance aimed at easing rather than tightening. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies that the FOMC is focused on supporting the economy and addressing unemployment rather than on concerns about rising inflation."
2,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to two distinct issues that can affect monetary policy: the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, which limits the central bank's ability to use traditional monetary policy tools when rates are near zero, and labor market conditions, which are a key determinant of both inflation and employment. The sentence does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges challenges that the FOMC must consider in its policy decisions. The mention of the zero bound could imply a constraint on easing policy further, while labor market conditions could signal either a need to tighten or ease policy depending on the specific circumstances. Without additional context on the state of the labor markets or the position of interest rates relative to the zero bound, the stance remains balanced or unclear."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected economic condition related to the foreign exchange value of the dollar and its impact on exports and imports, without directly suggesting an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It acknowledges the influence of exchange rates on trade balance, which is a factor the FOMC considers, but it does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. The statement is more about the observation of economic dynamics rather than a hint at future monetary policy moves."
0,"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.4 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a significant decrease in core consumer price inflation, which suggests that inflationary pressures are diminishing. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflation rate is moving away from the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. In response to lower inflation, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent deflationary risks."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to correct market prices if they are misaligned with the Federal Reserve's assessment of the economy or its policy intentions. This suggests that the FOMC is prepared to take action, potentially tightening monetary policy, to ensure that market expectations align with their goals for price stability and to anchor the market accordingly. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the central bank is proactive in addressing inflationary pressures or other economic imbalances."
1,They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering the impact of higher energy prices on household income and spending, which is a factor in their assessment of economic conditions. It does not directly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows attentiveness to economic indicators that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on understanding the effects of energy prices aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on a range of indicators."
0,"moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is experiencing slow growth, which implies that the recovery is fragile and could be easily disrupted by negative events. This indicates a concern for economic weakness, which would typically lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth and employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
1,The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The unemployment rate ticked down to 5."" provides information about a decrease in the unemployment rate but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It is a factual statement about an economic indicator. Without additional context on whether the FOMC views this level of unemployment as close to maximum employment or whether it will influence their policy decisions, it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish. It simply reports a change in an economic condition relevant to the FOMC's goals."
0,Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that firms have increased productivity through significant cost-cutting measures, which could potentially have various implications for monetary policy. On one hand, increased productivity can lead to higher output without additional inflationary pressure, which might not necessitate a change in monetary policy stance. On the other hand, cost-cutting could imply layoffs or reduced wage growth, which could affect employment levels. However, the sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL. It reflects an economic development that the FOMC might consider in its broader analysis of economic conditions without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that businesses are not increasing prices despite rising labor costs, likely due to strong competition. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The lack of price increases to offset higher labor costs implies that the FOMC might not see an immediate need to raise interest rates to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current monetary policy to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the benefits of stable prices for all, particularly for those on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution. It reflects the FOMC's goal of price stability, which is one of its key mandates. However, the sentence does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy (tightening or easing). Instead, it provides a rationale for why price stability is important, which is a core objective of the FOMC and is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance that aims to balance the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential complications and questions that could arise from selecting a range for inflation targets without specifying a preferred midpoint. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather addresses considerations in policy communication and target setting. The focus is on the clarity and implications of policy decisions rather than immediate action to adjust monetary conditions."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the speaker does not believe that a moderate increase in the federal funds rate would significantly impact investor optimism regarding emerging technologies. This indicates a view that monetary policy adjustments of 50 to 100 basis points would not have a strong influence on this aspect of the economy, which implies neither a clear call for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective on the effectiveness of monetary policy in this context, aligning with a neutral stance."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like"" does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions. It is a reflective statement that does not provide information on whether the speaker believes policy should be tightened or eased. It merely acknowledges past experiences with high inflation, without suggesting any particular policy direction in response to current economic conditions."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies that the conditions are expected to become more conducive to growth without adding inflationary pressure, which could reduce the need for tightening monetary policy. The expectation of reduced inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates less urgency for measures to cool the economy."
2,Another factor viewed as likely to exert a moderating effect on the growth of economic activity was the expectation of some slowing in inventory investment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a natural moderation in economic growth due to a projected slowdown in inventory investment. This does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a factor that could influence economic activity. It reflects an observation of economic conditions without a clear bias towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In agriculture, depressed levels of crop prices and weak global demand continued to weaken farm income.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are sector-specific economic challenges, such as low crop prices and weak global demand, which are leading to reduced farm income. This suggests that the agricultural sector is not contributing to inflationary pressures, and might even be experiencing deflationary conditions. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy to support this sector and counteract these negative economic trends, without risking the overshooting of their inflation target."
1,What policy options exist to deal with the U.S. current account deficit?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about policy options to address the U.S. current account deficit, which is a broader economic issue and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. The current account deficit is related to trade and investment balances rather than the specific monetary policy goals of employment, inflation, and interest rates. Therefore, without additional context suggesting a preference for either tightening or easing monetary policy, the sentence is classified as neutral."
1,"The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to make gradual adjustments to monetary policy, which suggests a balanced approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The use of the word ""gradual"" implies a careful and measured approach to policy changes, neither signaling a clear intent to tighten aggressively (hawkish) nor to ease (dovish). The expectation of moderate economic expansion and strong labor market conditions reflects a view that the current policy path is appropriate to maintain the balance between their objectives."
1,Core measures of price inflation had moved up over recent quarters and particularly so over the last few months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that core measures of price inflation have been increasing, particularly in the recent months. This suggests that inflation is trending above the FOMC's long-term goal of 2%, which could lead the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to cool down inflation and steer it back towards the target. Tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates or taking other actions that would be considered hawkish."
0,Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is being kept low due to reduced demand and lower oil prices, which suggests that there is less pressure on the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply a stance that leans towards easing or maintaining the current policy to support economic activity, as inflation is not posing a significant threat to the stability of prices, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of monetary policy as a broad tool that affects the overall economy rather than being able to target specific sectors or regions. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the limitations of the tools at the FOMC's disposal. This statement is more about the characteristics of monetary policy instruments than about a specific policy direction."
1,"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates expectations of strong economic growth leading to a rapid decrease in unemployment rates, which could potentially overshoot the FOMC's maximum employment goal. This scenario often creates upward pressure on wages and prices, potentially leading to higher inflation. In such a context, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation. This statement is more of an observation on economic behavior and historical context rather than a direct indication of current monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy by the FOMC. Instead, it reflects on factors that influence the public's response to potential inflationary policies and their understanding of inflation, which are important considerations for the FOMC but do not in themselves indicate a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that commodity prices have been rising sharply, which could signal increasing inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, rising inflation may prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from moving too far above the target rate."
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where credit conditions in the commercial real estate sector are easing and loan growth is solid, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It is merely an observation of current market conditions without a clear implication for tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might view this as a positive development for economic activity, but it does not suggest an immediate need for policy action to either curb excessive growth (which would be hawkish) or to stimulate the economy (which would be dovish)."
1,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that with interest rates already low, the central bank has limited room to maneuver in the event of additional negative demand shocks. This suggests a recognition of the need to possibly raise rates or at least maintain them at the current level to preserve the ability to cut them in the future if necessary, which is a stance associated with tightening monetary policy."
0,"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an overview of the actions taken by major central banks in response to crises, highlighting the correlation in their monetary policies. It does not indicate a specific direction for future policy (tightening or easing) but rather describes past coordinated actions to address economic challenges. The mention of cutting policy rates to effective lower bounds, increasing balance sheets, and offering forward guidance reflects past responses to stimulate economies during downturns but does not signal a current policy stance."
0,"I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, and people are having a hard time there.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes regional economic conditions, specifically in parts of South Carolina, mentioning high unemployment and foreclosure rates, and the difficulties faced by people in that area. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments, such as changes to the federal funds rate or other measures that the FOMC might take to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Instead, it provides context on local economic disparities, which may be considered in the broader analysis of economic conditions but does not in itself suggest a move toward tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a general belief in the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in achieving noninflationary economic growth, without indicating a specific direction for future policy changes. It emphasizes the importance of focusing on long-run goals, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and maximum employment. However, it does not provide information on whether the policymaker supports tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral."
1,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for stronger growth in investment and its positive effects on incomes and overall spending. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather describes an economic scenario that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The sentence is neutral as it does not lean towards a stance that would suggest an imminent change in monetary policy but rather acknowledges a factor that could impact economic conditions."
1,"In addition, though the unemployment rate has fallen since the middle of 2003, the participation rate currently remains near the low point reached in the first half of 2004.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the unemployment rate has improved but is counterbalanced by a low participation rate, which does not clearly indicate a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed economic situation where employment has increased (potentially hawkish), but the low participation rate could suggest underlying weaknesses in the labor market (potentially dovish), thus the overall stance is neutral."
1,The unemployment rate fell to 5.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""The unemployment rate fell to 5%"" indicates an improvement in the labor market, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. This situation might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy when employment is strong can help to stabilize prices, which is consistent with the FOMC's mandate for maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Over time, spot prices are inexorably drawn back to the long-term equilibrium price, as the balance between underlying supply and demand is restored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general economic principle regarding the relationship between supply and demand and their effect on prices over time, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on the FOMC's stance on current economic conditions relative to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes the effects of an ""unanticipated monetary ease,"" which typically means a loosening of monetary policy. However, the context of the sentence implies that this is not the current stance but rather a theoretical scenario. The mention of ""lower interest rates"" and a ""stimulus to net exports"" as a result of monetary easing suggests that the current policy is not aligned with these outcomes, implying that the actual stance is more restrictive or 'hawkish' compared to the scenario described. The FOMC might be maintaining or considering a tighter policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target or to address other economic concerns."
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target, suggesting that if inflation has been persistently below this level, the Committee is prepared to allow it to run moderately above 2 percent for some time to balance out the average. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much. The stance is proactive in ensuring price stability by adjusting policy to correct for past deviations in inflation, aligning with the goal of achieving the long-term inflation target."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence presents a balanced view of inflation expectations, with potential downside risks being counterbalanced by upside risks. On one hand, it acknowledges the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations might have decreased, which could be seen as a dovish signal suggesting less concern about inflationary pressures. On the other hand, it warns that current inflation could persist, especially in an economy operating above its potential, which is a hawkish concern indicating the possibility of needing to tighten policy to prevent overheating. The use of ""roughly counterbalanced"" indicates that the FOMC sees these risks as evenly matched, which supports a neutral stance."
2,"In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In Japan, consumer prices were about unchanged"" does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy. It is merely an observation of price stability in the Japanese economy, which does not suggest a clear action for tightening or easing U.S. monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such international economic conditions in their decision-making process, but this statement alone does not reflect a specific policy direction regarding the U.S. goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided not to change the previously set tentative ranges for money growth, due to substantial uncertainty in projections. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the current policy stance without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. The decision reflects a balanced view, aiming to achieve the Committee's objectives while considering economic uncertainties."
0,"In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the household sector where mortgage debt growth is slowing, which is a reflection of decelerating house prices. This statement is simply an observation of economic conditions and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or altering its monetary policy stance. The sentence is more about the state of the housing market and consumer borrowing rather than a clear signal of policy direction."
0,Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement regarding economic research findings on productivity growth and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that could inform future policy decisions."
1,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there."" suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to maintain the current economic conditions. The use of the phrase ""a good place"" implies satisfaction with the current state of the economy in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The commitment to using monetary policy tools to maintain these conditions suggests a readiness to respond to changes but does not signal a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"I would note, by the way, that at the current moment, it doesn’t really matter whether we have one mandate or two, because we’re below our inflation target and we—unemployment is above where we’d like it to be.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both inflation and unemployment are not at their desired levels, with inflation below the target and unemployment higher than preferred. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to stimulate the economy, raise inflation to the target level, and reduce unemployment, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"With the Committee in the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies and communication, and no additional accommodation being provided at this meeting, a few members indicated that they could support the Committee's decision even though they had not favored recent policy actions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while some members did not agree with recent policy actions, they are willing to support the Committee's current decision to not provide additional accommodation. This suggests a pause or status quo in policy rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing, reflecting a balanced or neutral stance. The mention of a review of monetary policy strategies and communication also implies a period of assessment rather than immediate action."
0,Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Some survey measures of inflation expectations declined during the period"" suggests that inflation expectations are falling, which could indicate a lower risk of inflation in the future. This could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation. Lower inflation expectations are consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and if these expectations are aligned with the target inflation rate, it may reduce the need for immediate policy action to raise interest rates."
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects inflation to be higher than previously anticipated due to persistent upward pressure from import and commodity prices. This suggests a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the FOMC's target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to stabilize prices, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Moreover, many members saw some risk that an easing move at this point might trigger a strong further advance in stock market prices that would not be justified on the basis of likely future earnings and could therefore lead to a relatively sharp and disruptive market adjustment later.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern among FOMC members that an easing of monetary policy could lead to an unjustified surge in stock market prices, potentially resulting in a disruptive correction later on. This concern about the risk of market instability and the implication that policy easing might not be appropriate at this time suggests a preference for maintaining or tightening monetary policy to prevent such outcomes, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically the high demand for Treasury securities and the resulting low overnight repo rate, as well as the high number of failures to deliver Treasury securities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of financial market phenomena. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
0,The effects of the saving outflow may thus have been felt disproportionately on U.S. interest rates and the dollar.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically the impact of saving outflows on U.S. interest rates and the dollar, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather it provides an analysis of factors affecting the economy. This type of statement is typically used to inform the public and market participants about the economic considerations that the FOMC takes into account when making policy decisions."
1,"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of addressing projected growth in entitlement spending on expectations of stability. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather speaks to fiscal policy and its potential effects on economic expectations. The focus on long-term fiscal stability aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but without a clear direction on immediate monetary policy adjustments, the stance is neutral."
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects real GDP growth to increase slowly, with the support of accommodative monetary policy, which typically means lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in line with a dovish policy approach aimed at supporting growth and employment."
2,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is unable to provide additional monetary easing through its usual method of cutting short-term interest rates. This suggests that the current policy stance is not towards easing (which would be dovish), and the inability to cut rates further could be interpreted as a signal that monetary policy may be tight or is at least not becoming more accommodative, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to not easing monetary policy until there is convincing and compelling evidence that inflation is decreasing. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on combating inflation and is prepared to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to ensure that inflation trends towards their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy has been growing above trend for three years, which has substantially reduced economic slack. This implies that the economy might be operating near or at its full capacity, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence merely observes a market phenomenon, noting the ""remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market."" It does not directly indicate a policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is descriptive and does not provide insight into the Committee's plans to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools in response to inflation or employment changes. It lacks a clear direction on how the FOMC might act to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook on business investment growth due to favorable factors such as attractive pricing, technological improvements, and the availability of financing. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on supportive factors for business investment aligns with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as a healthy investment climate can contribute to economic growth and job creation. However, the sentence does not suggest immediate policy action, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"So in terms of financial markets and monetary policy, we—as we say in our statement every cycle, we do take financial conditions into consideration because financial—broader financial conditions do affect the broader economy, and they’re one of the many things that we take into account.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC considers financial market conditions as one of many factors in its decision-making process. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather communicates that financial conditions are a part of the broader economic picture that the Committee evaluates. This reflects a balanced approach to considering various indicators in line with their goals for maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential implications of a slower rate of price declines in high-tech products on investment demand and productivity growth. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather assesses factors that could influence economic conditions. The focus is on understanding how changes in technology prices might affect economic forecasts, which is part of the FOMC's broader analysis when considering policy decisions."
0,Measures of forward inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation swaps fell further.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that measures of expected inflation are falling, as seen in Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation swaps. This suggests that market participants anticipate lower inflation in the future, which could imply that there is less pressure for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Lower expected inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it may lead to maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic activity and employment."
2,"Case studies of individual industries show that, in some cases, the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the effectiveness of technological investments in certain industries and their impact on productivity and profits, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions."
0,"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that current inflation expectations are stable enough that fluctuations in energy prices do not significantly impact core inflation, suggesting that these price changes do not necessitate a strong monetary policy response. This reflects a balanced view, implying neither an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor for easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC sees the current situation as within their target range for inflation, where temporary price shocks do not lead to an automatic change in policy."
2,"In dissenting, Mr. Meyer noted that although the money growth ranges do not play an important role in the conduct of monetary policy today, Congress has mandated that the FOMC set and report ranges for money and credit growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural aspect of the FOMC's operations regarding the setting and reporting of money and credit growth ranges, as mandated by Congress. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a member's view on the role of money growth ranges in current policy conduct, which is more about the process and legal obligations rather than an active policy direction aimed at influencing employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,President George dissented because she believed that an unchanged setting of policy was appropriate based on the incoming data and the outlook for economic activity over the medium term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that President George preferred to maintain the current monetary policy settings, suggesting a view that the existing policy was adequate in light of the economic data and medium-term outlook. This stance does not clearly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to keep it unchanged, reflecting a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Signs of an actual change in inflation were still quite tentative and anecdotal, and they did not warrant an adjustment to policy at this meeting.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the evidence of inflation change is not strong enough to justify a change in monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC does not see an immediate need to tighten policy to combat inflation. This implies a stance towards maintaining or easing the current policy rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It seems to be describing a factor or a formula that might be considered in the context of economic analysis or policy setting. The mention of inflation and productivity growth does not inherently suggest a stance on adjusting the monetary policy but rather points to components that might influence such decisions. The FOMC might use this as part of their assessment in achieving stable prices and maximum employment, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective on economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty levels."
1,"In response to the resulting high inflation, the Fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in response to high inflation, which is a tightening of monetary policy typically associated with a hawkish stance. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down an overheating economy and bring down inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The mention of a weakened economy as a result of this action does not change the classification but rather describes a consequence of the hawkish policy."
0,"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a view on productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates a concern about the pace of productivity growth, which can affect long-term economic performance, but it does not explicitly advocate for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on productivity data reflects the FOMC's use of a range of indicators to inform its decisions, but the sentence itself does not reveal a clear stance towards a more hawkish or dovish policy direction."
1,Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants expect inflation to increase as resources become more utilized and wage pressures grow. This expectation of rising inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
1,"These forecasts and forward guidance had a significant effect on raising market interest rates, even though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in December 2021.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the effect of forecasts and forward guidance on market interest rates without indicating a change in the primary policy tool, the federal funds rate. It suggests that communication alone influenced market conditions, but it does not explicitly state a policy action towards tightening or easing. The sentence reflects the FOMC's transparency and its impact on expectations but does not directly signal a shift in monetary policy stance."
0,"we project that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation will rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC expects inflation to increase gradually to the target rate under the current monetary policy framework, without suggesting any immediate action to either tighten or ease the policy. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the inflation goal, suggesting that the current policy stance is appropriate to meet the objectives."
0,"""4 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.5 Concluding Remarks While economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not forget that full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the new framework as an evolution in strategy but emphasizes that the core goals of maximum employment and price stability remain unchanged. It also recognizes the ongoing economic recovery while noting that there is still significant progress to be made. This statement does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather maintains a balanced view on the current economic situation and the Federal Reserve's objectives."
2,they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully"" indicates a stance of vigilance and ongoing assessment rather than a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to policy-making, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices, one of its key goals. The statement suggests that the Committee is neither signaling an immediate action nor ruling out future actions, but rather emphasizing the importance of monitoring economic indicators to inform their decisions."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, aiming to achieve both goals without leaning towards either tightening or easing measures."
1,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members referred to widespread indications of increasingly tight labor markets and to statistical and anecdotal reports of faster increases in labor compensation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are observing signs of tight labor markets and increasing labor compensation, which are often precursors to higher inflation. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of globalization on inflation and the performance of the standard model in predicting inflation trends. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the complexities of understanding inflation dynamics. The statement is analytical and does not suggest any immediate policy action, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a neutral observation about the challenges in economic forecasting due to changes in productivity. This statement does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future monetary policy adjustments, as it does not explicitly relate to employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the core concerns of the FOMC. It merely acknowledges that increasing productivity can make it more difficult to predict economic outcomes, which could have various implications for monetary policy."
2,"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it offers to explain the function of the FOMC and the general effects of monetary policy on the economy, which is a neutral statement regarding policy stance."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of economic condition regarding productivity levels. Low productivity could have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral. It does not inherently suggest an immediate need for a policy change to either tighten or ease conditions."
1,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the consumer price index (CPI), a measure of inflation, rose faster than in recent months, which is primarily due to an increase in consumer energy prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures may be building, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
1,"It was noted, however, that increases in compensation that exceeded productivity gains might be absorbed to some extent by a narrowing of firms’ high profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the relationship between compensation increases, productivity gains, and firms' profit margins. It suggests that if wages rise faster than productivity, the impact on inflation might be mitigated by a reduction in firms' profit margins, rather than leading directly to inflationary pressures. This statement does not clearly lean towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses a potential balancing factor in the economy. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions without a direct indication of a policy action."
2,The reserve conditions contemplated at this meeting were expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of slower growth in the money supply measures M2 and M3, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. This could be seen as a move to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Slowing the growth of the money supply is typically a tool used to cool economic activity and reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations and expectations without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. The decline in Treasury bond yields could be due to various factors, including market expectations of future policy rates and a shift in investor preferences towards safer assets. This does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is moving towards a more hawkish or dovish stance, but rather reflects market participants' perceptions and reactions to economic conditions."
1,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is economic growth in terms of household spending and business investment, which is generally a positive sign for the economy. However, it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is simply an observation of economic conditions without a clear direction on policy adjustments. It reflects the FOMC's goal of fostering maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates, but without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
1,"Inflation-targeting regimes may allow some consideration of real-side costs either by specifying relatively long adjustment periods, to allow a high probability that the central bank can bring inflation down to the target within the allotted time, or by including ""escape clauses"" that grant temporary exemptions for large supply shocks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a feature of inflation-targeting regimes, explaining how they can be designed to consider the real-side costs of economic adjustments. It mentions the possibility of allowing longer periods for inflation to return to target levels or including escape clauses for exceptional circumstances. This does not directly indicate an immediate stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a flexible approach to achieving long-term inflation targets while balancing economic stability. It reflects a balanced view that accommodates the dual mandate of price stability and employment without signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential consequences of setting a strict numerical target for price stability, suggesting that doing so without legislative support could harm the democratic balance and provoke a backlash. This statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects on the broader implications of the FOMC's approach to setting targets. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between the FOMC's goals and the democratic process, without providing a clear direction on future monetary policy adjustments."
0,"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a scenario where economic activity is severely disrupted, resulting in lower real GDP and inflation, and a higher unemployment rate. This suggests that the economy is underperforming relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In such a context, a dovish stance would be appropriate, as it would imply a need for easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and counteract the negative trends in GDP, inflation, and unemployment."
1,Hungary and Poland adopted inflation targeting following parliamentary acts stipulating that price stability was the main objective for the central bank.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about the monetary policy frameworks adopted by Hungary and Poland, stating that they chose inflation targeting with a focus on price stability. It does not provide information on the current stance of monetary policy (whether it is being tightened or eased) by the Federal Reserve or any indication of a change in policy direction. It simply states a fact about other countries' central banks' objectives, which aligns with the general goal of price stability that many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, aim to achieve."
0,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is expected to move towards full utilization of its resources without causing a rise in inflation. This suggests that there is room for the economy to grow without the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing to encourage employment and growth when inflation is not a concern."
0,"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a trend toward disinflation, which means a reduction in the rate of inflation, and this trend might continue due to a potentially large amount of economic slack (unused economic capacity). A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that aim to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other measures to increase economic activity. In this context, the mention of disinflation and economic slack implies that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates, which aligns with a dovish policy stance that supports easing to promote employment and economic growth, consistent with the FOMC's objectives."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes that the current state of monetary policy is appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the current policy stance in relation to the economic outlook at the time of the meeting. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
2,We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""We're looking at wages and we're looking at ultimately inflation"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC is monitoring key economic indicators, such as wages and inflation, which are central to their mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on the trends or levels of these indicators, or the FOMC's interpretation of the data, it is not possible to determine whether this statement leans toward a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is best classified as neutral."
2,"In preparation for the Federal Reserve's semiannual report to the Congress on the economy and monetary policy, the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submitted individual projections of the growth of GDP, the rate of unemployment, and core consumer price inflation for the years 2006 and 2007.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine preparatory activity where members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks submit their economic projections. This activity is part of the Federal Reserve's process for informing Congress and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and data-driven decision-making but does not reveal any specific policy direction."
0,U.S. inflation remains muted.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""U.S. inflation remains muted"" suggests that inflation is not currently a concern, as it is not rising or is below the target level. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, which is typically done to combat high inflation. Therefore, the stance is dovish, indicating a potential for easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy or at least maintaining the current policy without tightening."
2,Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fiscal development regarding the budget balance, moving from a deficit to a surplus, and notes that this change was more dramatic than anticipated. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on fiscal outcomes, which are distinct from the monetary policy actions the FOMC is responsible for. While fiscal policy can influence the economic conditions the FOMC considers when setting monetary policy, this sentence alone does not suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants' outlook on the economy is stable, with expectations of moderate growth continuing and a gradual pickup over time. There is no clear indication of a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an expectation that the current state of the economy will persist, which aligns with a neutral stance. The sentence reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a need to adjust policy in response to changes in economic activity or inflation pressures."
2,Higher productivity is unambiguously good.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Higher productivity is unambiguously good"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a general statement affirming the positive aspect of increased productivity, which can lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflation. This statement does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. It simply acknowledges that productivity growth is beneficial for the economy, which aligns with the FOMC's long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not suggest any immediate policy adjustments."
0,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the historically observed relationship between resource utilization (or unemployment) and inflation is weakening. This suggests that low unemployment is not leading to higher inflation as it might have in the past. Therefore, the FOMC may not need to tighten monetary policy as aggressively in response to falling unemployment rates, which is a dovish stance. It indicates a potential for a more accommodative policy to support employment without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the difficulty of predicting asset price bubbles and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects on the challenges of forecasting economic events that could impact the FOMC's goals but does not suggest any specific policy action."
2,"Indeed, consumer expenditures appeared to have been expanding moderately over the previous few months, buoyed by increases in employment, personal income, and household wealth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where consumer expenditures are growing at a moderate pace, supported by positive economic indicators such as employment, personal income, and household wealth. This suggests a balanced economic environment that does not explicitly call for immediate monetary policy adjustments. The statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a steady state of economic conditions that align with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising inflation, which is often a signal for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The mention of ""the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks"" and specific factors like rising oil prices, stabilizing commodity prices, and increasing health care costs suggests that inflationary pressures are building, which aligns with a hawkish stance that may lead to increased interest rates or other contractionary measures to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices with a 2% inflation target."
0,"The drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in actual output relative to its potential, that is, the level of output that the economy can produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a decrease in demand which is causing actual output to fall below its potential, suggesting that the economy is not operating at the maximum sustainable level of employment. This scenario typically calls for a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate demand and move the economy towards its potential output, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies a need for easing monetary policy to address the shortfall in employment and output."
1,"The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the fundamentals for capital spending are strong, with rapid expansion in business sector output, firms having ample funds, and decreasing relative prices for high-tech equipment, which lowers the cost of its use. This suggests a robust economic environment where businesses are likely to invest more due to favorable conditions. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such strength in the business sector could lead to increased inflationary pressures, which might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
0,This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""This supports the view that there has been an increase in trend productivity growth"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about economic conditions, specifically productivity growth. Increased productivity can potentially lead to non-inflationary growth, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on how this productivity growth affects the overall economic outlook or monetary policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
1,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to maintaining price stability, which is often associated with preventing high inflation. The mention of having ""both the tools and the will to act"" suggests that the Federal Reserve is prepared to tighten monetary policy if necessary to control inflation. This stance is typically considered hawkish, as it emphasizes the priority of controlling inflation, which could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce monetary supply."
0,"Although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues to expect that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a slowdown in output and employment, the FOMC expects that with continued policy accommodation (which typically means keeping interest rates lower or providing other forms of monetary stimulus), economic activity will grow and labor market conditions will improve. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in order to support the economy and move closer to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States"" suggests that inflation expectations are relatively stable, which does not clearly indicate a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The stability in expectations aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests that the current policy stance may be appropriate to maintain the targeted inflation rate. Therefore, the sentence does not strongly signal a hawkish or dovish stance but rather a neutral one, as it reflects a situation where the FOMC might not see an immediate need to adjust policy in response to inflation expectations."
2,The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary tool for adjusting monetary policy—the target range for the federal funds rate—but does not indicate whether the Committee plans to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states the mechanism they use to influence monetary conditions, which is consistent with their standard approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Developments during the Second Period: 1998-2007 Research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on past research and its contributions to the understanding of monetary policy design in the face of uncertainty. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in policy direction, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the evolution of economic research, which is a neutral statement regarding the stance of monetary policy."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations to prevent them from causing instability but does not indicate a current policy direction or change. It emphasizes a general principle of successful monetary policy rather than suggesting an immediate action towards tightening or easing."
0,"Earlier in the year, as you will all recall, after careful study over a period of years, actually, the Committee announced the decision to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past decision by the FOMC to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime after a period of careful study. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a strategic choice regarding the framework for conducting monetary policy, which is neutral with respect to the immediate direction of policy adjustments."
1,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Home prices continued to rise briskly"" suggests that there is strong upward pressure on the housing market, which can be a sign of inflationary pressures in the economy. Rising home prices can contribute to overall inflation, which the FOMC may seek to control through a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Therefore, the statement can be interpreted as indicating a potential need for a more hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between consumer spending and changes in home values, particularly in the context of sophisticated mortgage markets like those in the United States. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on economic behavior that could be relevant to the FOMC's decision-making process. The sentence suggests that changes in home values might have a more significant impact on consumer spending than in the past, which is an important factor for the FOMC to consider when assessing economic conditions and setting policy, but it does not in itself advocate for a particular policy direction."
2,"If inflation remains higher during the course of 2022, then we may already have met that test by the time we reach liftoff.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if inflation continues to be high, the conditions for increasing interest rates (""liftoff"") may have already been met. This suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to address higher inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to high inflation to bring it back towards the target level, in this case, the 2% inflation rate goal."
2,"With inventories lower, firms were beginning to raise production to meet at least a portion of increased demand, and this adjustment was expected to make an important contribution to economic recovery in the fourth quarter of the year and, to a lesser extent, in 2010 as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically that firms are increasing production in response to higher demand, which is expected to contribute to economic recovery. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic situation. It suggests a balanced view of economic developments without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical context where Regulation Q impacted savings and loans institutions' ability to meet mortgage demands due to interest rate fluctuations. This statement is more of an observation of past regulatory effects on financial institutions rather than a current stance on monetary policy. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on the future direction of policy."
1,"Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where investment spending by corporations has grown faster than their retained earnings, leading them to seek additional funds through capital markets. This observation is a neutral statement regarding the state of corporate finance and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides an insight into corporate behavior that could be influenced by various factors, including but not limited to monetary policy."
2,"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy"" suggests a situation where the current state of the economy does not necessitate a change in monetary policy. It implies that the existing policy stance is appropriate for achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""may"" indicates uncertainty, which supports a classification of NEUTRAL, as it does not clearly signal an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
1,"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that monetary policy might be used to turn a temporary decrease in inflation into a permanent one. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to ensure that inflation remains low, aligning with a dovish approach that typically involves lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment, even at the risk of allowing inflation to fall below the target level."
0,"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a structural economic issue related to labor market dynamics and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges the impact of technical change on the labor market, which is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a signal of future monetary policy actions. The FOMC might consider such information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy response."
2,"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about market expectations leaning too much towards further easing, which suggests a preference to avoid signaling a potential loosening of monetary policy. This stance implies a readiness to tighten policy if necessary to prevent the embedding of easing expectations, aligning with the goal of maintaining stable prices and preventing an inflationary bias in market interest rates."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth, with a focus on the components of that growth such as private domestic final purchases and inventory investment. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects an observation of the current economic trends."
2,"The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the broad set of factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions, consistent with the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The inclusion of various indicators suggests a comprehensive and measured evaluation process rather than an immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected pattern of economic growth relative to the staff's estimate of potential growth, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that output is expected to grow slightly above potential in the near term and then slow down, which suggests a balanced view of economic performance. There is no clear indication that this would lead to either tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it does not explicitly relate to inflation pressures or employment shortfalls."
2,Such increases in productivity along with slack in foreign economies contributed to the very strong competition in most markets that was continuing generally to suppress efforts to raise prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that rising productivity and slack in foreign economies are leading to strong competition, which in turn is suppressing price increases. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not a current concern, which aligns with a dovish stance where there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The FOMC might interpret this as a signal that there is room for a more accommodative policy to support employment without risking their inflation target."
1,"After the stock-market decline that began in March 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there was a decline in stock-market activity leading to reduced capital investment and a lower demand for financing globally. This suggests an economic slowdown, which would typically lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance (i.e., easing) to stimulate investment and economic activity. The FOMC might consider such conditions as a reason to lower interest rates or implement other dovish policy measures to support maximum employment and stable prices, aligning with their long-term inflation target."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about inflationary pressures resulting from excessive government spending financed by money creation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation and protect the value of nominal assets, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
2,"However, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the long-term inflation expectations have remained stable, neither increasing significantly nor decreasing, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining inflation expectations around the target level. This stability in expectations does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL. It reflects a situation where the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates are being met without the need for immediate policy adjustments."
0,"Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target for some time, following periods when it has been below that level. This suggests a stance of monetary easing, as the FOMC is signaling a tolerance for higher inflation, which is typically associated with a dovish approach to stimulate the economy and support employment."
0,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a stance of monetary easing. The reference to ""highly accommodative policies"" suggests that the FOMC is keeping interest rates low or possibly engaging in other measures to stimulate the economy. This is in response to the conditions of elevated unemployment and inflation rates that are below the Committee's target, which aligns with a dovish approach aimed at supporting economic growth and pushing inflation towards the desired level."
0,"Even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for August showed weak job gains.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the employment report for August, even after adjusting for anomalies like strikes, showed weak job gains. This suggests that the labor market is not overheating and may be underperforming, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate employment, in line with its commitment to maximum employment. There is no indication of concern over inflation or the need to tighten policy to cool down the economy."
0,Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5."" does not provide a complete context or direction for monetary policy. An increase in the unemployment rate could be interpreted as a sign of a weakening economy, which might suggest a dovish stance if the FOMC were to consider easing policy to stimulate employment. However, without additional context on the reasons for the increase or its implications for inflation and long-term interest rates, it is not possible to determine a clear policy direction. Therefore, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment levels are holding steady and labor markets remain tight, which is generally a sign of economic strength, but it also notes signs of softening, which could suggest potential future weakness or uncertainty. This balance between positive and negative signals does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus the stance is neutral. It reflects an acknowledgment of the current state of employment, which is one of the FOMC's key concerns, without indicating a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the historical composition of America's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the nature of economic growth, which is influenced by various factors, including productivity and technological advancements, rather than just physical output. This statement does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future monetary policy adjustments."
1,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a recognition of positive economic developments, specifically in terms of progress towards achieving a sustainable unemployment rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather acknowledges an ongoing trend towards the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide information on the Committee's plans to adjust the monetary policy in response to the observed economic conditions."
2,"In a traditional growth accounting setup, these effects would show up in multifactor productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical aspect of economic analysis (growth accounting and multifactor productivity growth) rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is simply a statement about where certain economic effects would be observed within an analytical framework."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of predicting economic indicators and the complexities the FOMC faces in setting policy. This historical context does not suggest an immediate action towards achieving the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less upward pressure on prices, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. Instead, the FOMC might consider maintaining or easing monetary policy to move inflation towards its target, consistent with a dovish stance."
1,"In their discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence in the press statement to be issued shortly after this meeting, all the members agreed that the latter should continue to express, as it had for every meeting earlier this year, their belief that the risks remained weighted toward rising inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that all FOMC members agree that the risks are weighted toward rising inflation, which suggests a concern about inflation potentially exceeding their target. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically a weakening expansion in capital expenditures that may be due to an excess capacity in certain industries. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of the current economic situation. This information could be used to inform future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy stance."
2,"For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing a factual statement about how equities are evaluated in financial markets, specifically mentioning the use of the price-earnings ratio as a standard benchmark for assessing a stock's valuation. It does not directly indicate any stance on monetary policy or reflect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's views on current economic conditions or future policy moves."
0,"Regarding the ELB, the previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the likelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and the implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dual-mandate goals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) and acknowledges the challenges it presents for monetary policy without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects an awareness of the limitations that the ELB can impose during economic downturns and how it might affect the FOMC's ability to achieve its dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"Also, in the view of a number of participants, the economy was possibly producing in the neighborhood of its potential, and the persistent strength in spending of late suggested that resource markets could tighten further and inflation pressures build.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe the economy is operating near its potential and that strong spending could lead to tighter resource markets and increased inflation pressures. This suggests a concern for rising inflation, which would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, members of the Board of Governors and participating Federal Reserve Bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate for each year from 2015 through 2017 and over the longer run, conditional on each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects the Committee's practice of considering a range of economic indicators and forecasts to inform their policy decisions. The sentence shows the Committee's commitment to transparency and data-driven decision-making, which is consistent with their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not, however, provide information on the direction of policy adjustments."
2,"As you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement describing the federal funds rate and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's future policy actions or its current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but simply explains the mechanism through which the FOMC influences short-term interest rates."
0,"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider a wide range of information before deciding on the duration of a highly accommodative monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced approach, as the Committee is not signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing policy. Instead, it is stating that it will take into account various economic indicators, including labor market conditions, inflation data, and financial developments, to inform its policy decisions. This reflects a commitment to a comprehensive assessment of the economic situation, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a specific direction for future policy changes."
2,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a shift towards a more balanced view of economic risks, with neither a clear indication of a need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. The mention of increased upside risks to domestic demand could be seen as potentially hawkish, as it might suggest stronger economic activity that could lead to inflationary pressures. However, the simultaneous diminution of foreign risks seems to counterbalance this, suggesting that the overall risk to the economic outlook is neither particularly skewed towards overheating (which would be hawkish) nor towards underperformance (which would be dovish). Therefore, the statement is best classified as neutral, reflecting an even-handed view of the economic landscape in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Demand-pull inflation pressures from emerging-market economies abroad appeared to be continuing, and anecdotal reports from business contacts suggested greater willingness domestically to pass rising costs through to prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation pressures are persisting, particularly from demand-pull factors in emerging-market economies, and that there is a domestic trend of businesses passing on rising costs to prices. This suggests that inflation is a concern and may warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep it in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"November 01, 2006 Community Development Financial Institutions: Promoting Economic Growth and Opportunity Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the Opportunity Finance Networkâ€™s Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. Share Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to your annual conference.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a greeting and does not provide any information on monetary policy stance. It neither indicates a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy, nor does it offer insights into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged over the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of supply and demand for small business credit without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It suggests that there has been no significant change in the conditions, and demand remains weak, which does not directly imply a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is simply observational and does not hint at any particular action the FOMC might take in response to these conditions."
2,"In contrast, Robert Lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (Lucas, 1972; Sargent and Wallace, 1975).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to the academic views of economists Robert Lucas and others regarding the effectiveness of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC but rather discusses a theoretical perspective on the limitations of monetary policy's impact on the real economy."
0,"Two changes have particular relevance for the employment leg of the dual mandate.15 The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in the Federal Reserve's approach to a more accommodative stance regarding employment. By focusing on eliminating shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, rather than also minimizing deviations when employment is too high, the FOMC is signaling a willingness to tolerate potentially higher levels of employment without preemptively tightening monetary policy. This suggests a dovish tilt, as the emphasis is on supporting employment rather than containing inflation that might arise from an overheated labor market."
