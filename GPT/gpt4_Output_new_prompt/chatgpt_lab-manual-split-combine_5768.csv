0,"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the U.S. international trade deficit has decreased due to a significant rise in exports compared to a moderate increase in imports. This information is primarily related to trade balance and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC, as it does not directly address inflation pressures, employment levels, or long-term interest rates. The statement is simply reporting an economic development without a clear implication for monetary policy adjustments."
0,"Based on historical experience, it seems improbable that all of the large rise in multifactor productivity could be attributed to cyclical or transitory factors.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the increase in multifactor productivity is likely to be more structural than temporary. Higher productivity can lead to higher potential output without increasing inflation, which might reduce the need for accommodative monetary policy. This could be interpreted as a signal that less monetary stimulus might be needed, aligning with a hawkish stance that favors tightening to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check."
2,"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical context where mortgage lenders were limited by regulations that affected their deposit base during periods of rising interest rates. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather provides background on past regulatory impacts on financial institutions."
2,The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic data regarding net exports and their impact on real GDP growth, without directly suggesting a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It indicates an improvement in the trade balance component of GDP but does not explicitly tie this to a policy action or change in stance. The FOMC may use such data to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in monetary policy."
2,"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method for assessing inflation pressures by excluding volatile food and energy prices, which is a common practice to understand the underlying inflation trend. This approach does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a technique for better understanding inflation dynamics. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to making informed decisions based on a range of indicators, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance focused on achieving stable prices over the long term."
2,"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy"" suggests a situation where the current state of the economy does not necessitate a change in monetary policy. This indicates that the FOMC does not see a need to either tighten or ease the policy, implying a balanced approach that is neither hawkish nor dovish. The statement reflects a stance where the FOMC believes that its current policy is appropriate to maintain maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without the need for immediate adjustments."
0,"In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation in the U.S. is not accelerating, which suggests there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat rising prices. This could imply a stance towards easing or maintaining the current policy rather than moving towards a more restrictive approach. The FOMC may interpret muted inflation as being in line with or below their target inflation rate of 2%, which could reduce the need for immediate policy tightening to control inflation."
0,These geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that geopolitical events are expected to have a negative impact on economic growth. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that support growth when there is a risk of economic downturn, which may include maintaining lower interest rates or implementing measures to ease monetary conditions. The focus on downside risks to growth aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies a potential need for monetary policy easing to counteract these risks and support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members expect inflation to decrease in the near future, which implies that there may be less need for aggressive tightening of monetary policy. This anticipation of moderating inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a potential easing of concerns over inflationary pressures."
2,"But it could be that if interest rates rise quickly, for example, that we would be in a situation of not giving remittances to the Treasury for a couple of years, and that would create problems, no doubt, for the Fed in terms of congressional response.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where interest rates are rising quickly, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. The concern about not giving remittances to the Treasury suggests that the Federal Reserve is anticipating the consequences of a higher interest rate environment, which could be due to efforts to control inflation or other economic factors that warrant a more restrictive monetary stance. The mention of potential problems with congressional response indicates an awareness of the broader implications of such a policy move."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about technological innovation and its impact on productivity, specifically the spread of electrification to the factory floor following World War I. It does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates that would influence the current monetary policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral with respect to monetary policy."
1,"Major stock price indexes were up a bit over the intermeeting period, as positive first-quarter earnings reports more than offset the negative effects of higher energy prices and rising interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply states that stock prices increased due to positive earnings reports, which balanced out the negative impacts of higher energy prices and rising interest rates. This information is more about the economic environment the FOMC is considering rather than a signal of their policy intentions."
0,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical lesson in monetary policy, cautioning against overreacting to temporary fluctuations in inflation. It suggests that responding to short-term changes in inflation could be counterproductive, especially when policy rates are near the lower bound, which limits the effectiveness of monetary policy. This stance is neither explicitly advocating for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather emphasizes a measured approach that takes into account the limitations and potential risks of policy adjustments."
1,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a preference for responding vigorously to economic disturbances, such as bubbles, even if the response is traumatic, over the long-term negative effects of a high-inflation monetary policy. This implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent high inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability over short-term growth concerns."
0,But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the target level of 2 percent. This suggests that if inflation is currently below the target, the FOMC is willing to adopt policies that could increase inflation, which may include lowering interest rates or other expansionary measures. However, the commitment to raising inflation typically implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy once the inflation target is approached or exceeded to prevent it from going too high, which is a hawkish stance."
2,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a low target range for the federal funds rate, which is a sign of an easing monetary policy stance. The decision to keep rates low until labor market conditions align with maximum employment objectives and inflation reaches and is expected to moderately exceed the 2% target suggests a focus on stimulating economic activity and employment, rather than on containing inflation—a typical characteristic of a dovish stance. The Committee's willingness to allow inflation to exceed the target temporarily without tightening policy further reinforces the dovish classification."
1,"Spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern over the potential risks associated with very low spreads on risky private-sector debt and the negative consequences of high real estate prices and excessive leverage in the housing market. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to address these financial imbalances and mitigate the risk of inflationary pressures that could arise from an overheated housing market. Tightening monetary policy could help to prevent the formation of asset bubbles and ensure long-term price stability, aligning with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nationâ€™s underlying productive capacity.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that to achieve a sustainable and non-inflationary economic expansion, there needs to be a moderation in the growth of economic activity. This suggests that the FOMC may consider slowing down the economy to prevent it from overheating and causing inflation to rise above their target. Such a stance typically involves tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish approach."
0,Significant cost cutting by firms was thought to have led to a sizable increase in productivity growth in the first half of the year,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that firms have increased productivity through significant cost-cutting measures. Higher productivity growth can lead to a stronger economy without adding to inflationary pressures, which might reduce the need for an accommodative monetary policy stance. In this context, the statement could be interpreted as leaning towards a tighter monetary policy, or at least providing justification for one, as it implies that the economy might be performing well enough to handle a reduction in monetary stimulus. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could be seen as a step towards preventing potential overheating of the economy."
1,They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is growing at a potentially unsustainable rate, which could lead to overheating and higher inflation. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to slow down economic growth to a sustainable level and prevent inflation from rising above their target. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see a higher likelihood of inflation falling rather than rising, due to factors such as excess capacity in the economy (resource slack), potential declines in economic activity, and the risk of falling inflation expectations. This view suggests that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy and prevent deflation."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about inflationary pressures resulting from excessive government spending financed by money creation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent the devaluation of nominal assets and to maintain price stability, which aligns with a hawkish view. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to control the money supply and curb inflation."
2,"Of the 1,700 Washington employees, roughly 250 are Ph.D. economists, the majority of whom support the Board's monetary policy responsibilities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides information about the composition of the staff supporting the Board's monetary policy responsibilities but does not indicate a direction for monetary policy (tightening, easing, or maintaining current levels). It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor reflects a stance on the economic outlook, inflation, or employment levels."
0,"Regarding the ELB, the previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the likelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and the implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dual-mandate goals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Effective Lower Bound (ELB) and acknowledges the challenges it poses for monetary policy without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects an awareness of the constraints that the ELB can have on monetary policy effectiveness during economic downturns, which is a consideration for both tightening and easing policies. The focus is on the potential limitations to achieving the dual-mandate goals due to the ELB, rather than suggesting an immediate policy response."
1,"To date, the spillover from the surge in oil prices has been modest.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the increase in oil prices has had only a modest impact, suggesting that there may not be a significant immediate effect on inflation or economic activity that would warrant a change in monetary policy. It does not clearly signal a need to tighten or ease policy, but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as the situation develops."
0,"The “extended period” language is conditioned on exactly those same points: “Extended period” is conditioned on resource slack, on subdued inflation, and on stable inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the use of ""extended period"" language in the context of monetary policy is contingent upon the presence of resource slack, subdued inflation, and stable inflation expectations. This suggests a conditional approach to policy that is neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish), but rather dependent on the economic indicators mentioned. It reflects a balanced stance that could lead to either tightening or easing depending on how these conditions evolve."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is currently low and any increase in inflationary pressures is expected to rise slowly. This indicates that there is no immediate concern for inflation to overshoot the target, which would typically prompt a tightening of monetary policy. The mention of strong demand existing alongside stable financial conditions implies that the economy is performing well without generating significant inflation, which could justify a more accommodative stance or at least no rush to tighten policy. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, as it suggests there is room for monetary policy to remain easy or become more accommodative to support demand without risking the FOMC's inflation target."
0,A few participants judged that the expectations regarding the path of the federal funds rate implied by prices in financial markets were currently suggesting greater provision of accommodation at coming meetings than they saw as appropriate and that it might become necessary for the Committee to seek a better alignment of market expectations regarding the policy rate path with policymakers' own expectations for that path.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe the market expects a more accommodative policy (i.e., lower interest rates) than they deem appropriate. They suggest that it might be necessary to realign market expectations with a less accommodative stance, which implies a potential tightening of monetary policy to ensure that the federal funds rate path aligns with the policymakers' views. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus might be on preventing inflation from rising above the target or on other concerns that warrant less monetary accommodation."
0,another indicated that the Committee could provide guidance stating that it would not raise its target for the federal funds rate if the inflation rate was expected to run below a given level at a specific horizon.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee might consider committing to not raising the federal funds rate if inflation is expected to remain below a certain level at a specific future time. This indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy or at least not tightening it, in order to support economic activity and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's long-term target of 2%. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and is consistent with a policy that would be more accommodative if inflation is not at risk of overheating."
1,"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that fiscal stimulus may lead to higher inflation expectations (as seen by increased inflation compensation) and a steeper yield curve, which often suggests that investors expect stronger economic growth and potentially higher inflation. A broad dollar depreciation can also be inflationary as it makes imports more expensive. In response to these developments, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perspective on the unemployment rate is one of uncertainty, with risks perceived as being evenly distributed on both sides of their outlook. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based specifically on the unemployment rate at this time, as there is no implied bias towards concern over either rising unemployment (which might suggest a dovish stance) or overheating in the labor market (which might suggest a hawkish stance). Instead, the statement reflects a balanced view, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"We found that a surprise increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about 1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.17 Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that an unexpected increase in the federal funds rate target leads to a decline in equity indexes, which is a result of tightening monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy, such as raising the federal funds rate, is generally considered hawkish because it is used to control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. The fact that the sentence discusses the impact of a rate increase on the market suggests a focus on the potential for a tightening stance."
2,"Operationally, maintaining price stability requires abiding by the Taylor principle of raising nominal interest rates more than one for one in response to movements in inflation, especially those movements perceived as persistent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising nominal interest rates more than proportionally in response to increases in inflation, particularly when these increases are seen as persistent. This approach, known as the Taylor principle, suggests a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, which aligns with a hawkish stance. By adhering to this principle, the FOMC would be actively working to counteract inflationary pressures, consistent with its goal of stable prices."
2,"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about credit access and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states a fact about the growth of subprime mortgage lending and its impact on credit accessibility for lower-income households, without suggesting any particular action or concern regarding inflation or employment, which are the primary focuses of the FOMC's monetary policy decisions."
2,"And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is questioning the potential perception of a central bank's role in influencing asset prices if it takes certain steps. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a concern about the central bank's actions being interpreted as managing asset prices. This is more about the central bank's communication and the market's interpretation of its actions rather than a clear indication of a policy shift towards being more hawkish or dovish."
1,"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is increasing the pace at which it is reducing its balance sheet, which is a form of monetary tightening. By reducing the balance sheet at a faster rate and increasing the policy rate, the Fed is actively working to decrease demand to match supply, which is a typical hawkish approach aimed at controlling inflation and stabilizing prices. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating."
0,"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects a slow economic recovery and a gradual decrease in unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC may maintain or introduce policies to stimulate the economy until it sees more robust signs of recovery and a faster decline in unemployment, aligning with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support growth and employment."
0,"It was a question of not getting inflation up to our target on a robust, symmetric kind of a way.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern about inflation not reaching the target level in a consistent and balanced manner. This suggests that the FOMC may consider easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the desired 2% target. The use of ""not getting inflation up to our target"" indicates that current inflation is below what the Committee considers optimal, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates or other expansionary measures to increase economic activity and inflation."
2,"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today’s policy decision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the attention given to the policy decision, without indicating a stance on the economic outlook or policy adjustments."
2,"It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who pioneered the original Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of respect and acknowledgment towards former Federal Reserve Chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen for their roles in establishing the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012. It does not provide any indication of the current stance on monetary policy, whether it be tightening, easing, or maintaining the status quo. It merely references a historical fact about the development of the FOMC's policy framework and does not discuss current economic conditions or policy adjustments."
1,"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the economy has been growing above trend for three years, reducing the amount of slack (unused economic capacity). This suggests that the economy is closer to its full potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC participants on the long-term normal federal funds rate being lower due to secular forces affecting real interest rates. This observation is a neutral assessment of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of imminent policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment that will inform policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a change in the current policy stance."
2,"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the technical aspects of how the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) might use certain economic indicators (like the unemployment gap) to inform their policy decisions. It refers to the selection of coefficients for policy rules, which is a methodological choice rather than a direct indication of a policy stance. The sentence does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather it describes part of the process by which the FOMC might analyze economic conditions to make informed decisions."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about the frequency of the Chairman's testimonies before Congress and does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It neither indicates a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy, nor does it offer insight into the Committee's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided not to change the previously set tentative ranges for money growth, due to substantial uncertainty in projections. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the current policy stance without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced position that neither explicitly aims to counteract inflation nor to stimulate the economy, but rather to observe how the economic situation unfolds before making further adjustments."
2,"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the equilibrium real rate in the context of long-term economic balance, considering factors like productivity and population growth. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides a framework for understanding how the FOMC might assess the appropriate level for interest rates over the long term to achieve its goals. The focus on the equilibrium rate is about gauging the neutral rate that neither stimulates nor restrains economic activity, which is inherently a neutral concept."
1,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes both positive and negative effects of a rise in oil prices on the economy, indicating a balanced view without a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Lowering real household incomes and demand could be seen as a drag on the economy, while increased investment in drilling and benefits to oil-producing areas could stimulate economic activity. The statement does not explicitly suggest a need to adjust the monetary policy in response to these mixed effects."
2,So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical description of how trend inflation is determined and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely explains that there are statistical methods to identify a trend in inflation data, which is a neutral statement regarding policy actions."
2,"In the Committee’s discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, nearly all members favored keeping the target federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent at this meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the majority of the FOMC members agreed to maintain the target federal funds rate at its current level during the intermeeting period, suggesting a decision to neither tighten nor ease monetary policy at that time. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a shift towards more aggressive inflation control (hawkish) or stimulus (dovish)."
2,"But we are also searching for an absolute concept, the point of balance between supply and demand in the respective markets that divides excess demand from excess supply--in effect, the origin in a diagram relating inflation to excess demand and supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's analytical approach to finding a balance between supply and demand, which is a conceptual framework for understanding inflation dynamics. It does not directly indicate a current or future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects a neutral stance focused on analysis and assessment. The mention of seeking a ""point of balance"" suggests an aim for stability, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but without a clear direction on policy adjustments."
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of credit conditions and loan growth in the commercial real estate sector without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply reports observed conditions, which could be part of the broader economic assessment that informs policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy in response to these conditions."
1,"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that labor market conditions will self-correct over time, leading to a balance between labor demand and supply, which would naturally ease wage and price pressures. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, where the FOMC is not signaling an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy but is rather expecting the market to adjust on its own. This stance is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but reflects a belief in the eventual stabilization of key economic variables without immediate intervention."
1,Money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets (as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening).,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a rise in the opportunity cost of holding M2 assets, which usually happens when there is a tightening of monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The reference to policy tightening suggests a move towards a more restrictive monetary stance, which is considered hawkish."
2,"A few participants pointed to continued strong growth in multifamily construction, although the limited pipeline of new projects in one District suggested that activity could slow in 2015.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations on the state of multifamily construction growth, with a mixed outlook suggesting potential slowing in one District. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions in a specific sector. This type of information would be part of the broader economic analysis the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, but on its own, it does not suggest a move towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
1,"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's forecast for inflation has been revised upward due to recent data showing faster-than-expected increases in inflation, which suggests that the observed inflation is not entirely temporary. This could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation and bring it back towards the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. A revision upwards in the inflation forecast typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as it may lead to actions such as raising interest rates to maintain price stability."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing educational and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. This is more of a statement on structural issues within the economy rather than an immediate monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather highlights long-term economic challenges that could indirectly affect employment and productivity."
1,"Some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened,","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is a concern about potential inflationary pressures arising from tighter resource utilization, which could indicate a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target level. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates."
2,"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the current monetary policy action is being justified by a forward-looking approach that considers future output gaps and inflation. The Taylor Rule is a guideline for setting interest rates based on economic conditions, specifically the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation. A forward-looking variant implies that the FOMC is preemptively adjusting policy based on expected future economic conditions rather than just current data. If the policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation, it indicates a proactive stance to prevent overheating of the economy or rising inflation, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, hence a hawkish stance."
2,"The shift in the stance of monetary policy that we undertook in 2019 was, I believe, well timed and has been providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC's action in 2019 was a shift toward a more supportive monetary policy stance, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is described as having a positive effect on the economy and contributing to maintaining a favorable economic outlook, suggesting that the policy change was aimed at easing rather than tightening. The use of ""providing support to the economy"" implies efforts to boost economic growth and employment, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Some contacts indicated that while input costs were higher, it appeared that the pass-through of these higher costs to consumer prices was limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there is an increase in input costs, this increase is not leading to a proportional rise in consumer prices. This indicates that inflationary pressures from input costs may be contained, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is balanced, acknowledging a potential risk (higher input costs) but also noting that this risk is not currently translating into higher inflation for consumers."
2,"However, household spending had been relatively robust during the cyclical downturn and likely had only limited room for a pickup over coming quarters, and intense competitive pressures could well constrain profits, investment, and equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where household spending is strong despite an economic downturn, suggesting resilience in that sector of the economy. It also indicates that there may be limited potential for further growth in household spending and that competitive pressures might limit profits, investment, and equity prices. This assessment does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, as it presents a mixed view of economic conditions. It acknowledges both a positive aspect (robust household spending) and potential challenges (limited room for growth and competitive pressures), which could balance each other out in terms of policy implications."
2,Consumer food prices were little changed in August.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Consumer food prices were little changed in August"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the stability of food prices within that period, which could be interpreted as a sign of stable inflation in that sector. This stability aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices but does not provide enough context to suggest a shift in monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral."
0,largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there are increases in nominal labor compensation (wages) that are outpacing productivity growth. This situation can lead to inflationary pressures because when wages increase faster than productivity, it can result in higher costs for businesses, which may be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. The FOMC, which targets a 2% inflation rate over the long term, might see this as a signal to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that raising interest rates too soon could negatively impact the economic recovery and labor market conditions, which would be counterproductive to the FOMC's goals of achieving maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. This suggests a preference for maintaining a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support continued economic growth and progress towards these objectives, rather than tightening policy through rate increases."
2,"In contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the Desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of how the Federal Reserve's trading desk (the Desk) conducts open-market operations, specifically the use of repurchase agreements (repos) to manage temporary variations in the demand for reserves or changes in reserve supply. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a method of operational implementation to maintain market functioning. This is a procedural detail and does not inherently signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view on the underlying economic theory, suggesting that the basic interactions between demand, supply, and expectations remain consistent despite the impact of globalization. This statement is more about the understanding of economic mechanisms rather than an immediate policy direction."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance."" This suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring economic indicators and may be prepared to act, possibly by raising interest rates, to preempt inflationary pressures or other economic imbalances, in line with their goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""asymmetric directive"" implies that there is a greater likelihood of tightening than easing, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Conversely, fiscal policy expansion in the surplus countries could be used to augment domestic demand, but any such adjustments would need to take account of medium-term goals for fiscal consolidation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential use of fiscal policy to increase domestic demand in countries with a budget surplus, while also considering the importance of medium-term fiscal consolidation goals. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it refers to fiscal policy, which is separate from the monetary policy tools the FOMC uses. The sentence suggests a balanced approach to fiscal policy, weighing the benefits of stimulus against the need for fiscal sustainability, without providing clear implications for the direction of monetary policy."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a data-dependent approach, suggesting that future policy adjustments will be based on new economic information as it becomes available. This reflects a balanced stance, as it does not commit to either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather to responding to economic indicators related to inflation and growth. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, as it implies a willingness to adjust policy in either direction to maintain these objectives."
2,"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about the behavior of equity prices during different phases of the economic cycle, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic indicators that the FOMC might consider in their analysis."
2,Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent"" does not explicitly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the current rate of wage inflation, which is in line with the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2 percent. This suggests that the current wage inflation rate is neither causing concern for overheating (which would be hawkish) nor signaling a need for stimulus (which would be dovish), thus making the stance neutral."
0,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity has slowed down significantly after a period of rapid growth. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to support continued economic expansion and prevent a downturn, as a slower economy typically reduces concerns about inflation and may lead to underperformance on the employment front. The FOMC may consider measures to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"The role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical perspective on the structural changes within the Federal Reserve System following the 1929 stock market crash and during the early years of the Great Depression. It highlights the balance between centralized and regional responsibilities within the Federal Reserve System but does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it sets the stage for a discussion on how monetary policy is formulated, without revealing a specific direction or inclination towards hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"Although the unemployment rate is around a 50-year low, wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while unemployment is very low, which could suggest a tight labor market and potential inflationary pressures, the rise in wages is in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation. This balance suggests that the current situation is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation that would warrant a hawkish response, nor showing signs of economic weakness that would require a dovish stimulus. The FOMC might view this as a situation where the current policy stance is appropriate, and no immediate change is necessary to achieve their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny"" suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring inflation trends with the possibility of taking action to ensure price stability. This focus on inflation, especially if it is rising or expected to rise, often indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy, which is a hawkish stance."
1,Members agreed that the statement should continue to convey that inflation risks remained of greatest concern and that additional policy firming was possible.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about inflation risks and are considering further tightening of monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The mention of ""additional policy firming"" suggests that they are prepared to raise interest rates or take other measures to control inflation, aligning with their goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
0,Several participants commented that the factors that had contributed to low inflation during the previous expansion could again exert more downward pressure on inflation than expected.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a concern about potential downward pressure on inflation, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy. The mention of factors that could lead to low inflation indicates a readiness to maintain or ease monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling below the Committee's long-term target of 2%. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and might lead to actions that support economic growth and employment."
1,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. A widening trade deficit could have various implications for the economy, but without additional context on how the FOMC views this change in relation to inflation or employment, it does not clearly suggest a move toward either tightening or easing monetary policy. It is simply a statement of fact about the trade balance, which could be influenced by many factors outside of monetary policy."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees both economic activity and inflation projections as having more downside risks. This suggests that there is concern about economic weakness and lower inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and move inflation towards the target level. This dovish stance implies a potential easing of monetary policy to counteract the perceived risks of slowing economic growth and falling inflation."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply acknowledges external economic developments without suggesting a specific policy response by the FOMC."
2,"Participants noted that the timing of the resumption of growth in the U. S. economy depended on the containment measures put in place, as well as the success of those measures, and on the responses of other policies, including fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's view on the factors that will influence the timing of economic growth, specifically mentioning containment measures and the success of those measures, as well as the impact of other policies like fiscal policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the various external factors that will affect the economy's performance. This suggests a balanced approach, waiting for more information before committing to a specific monetary policy direction."
2,One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of behavioral finance theories on predictions for asset prices and saving behavior, which is more of an academic observation rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Accordingly, considerable caution needed to be exercised in assessing the outlook for productivity and in relying on projections of the economy and prices, which necessarily embodied judgments about this outlook, in making monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the need for careful consideration and caution in making monetary policy decisions based on projections that involve judgments about productivity and the economic outlook. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather underlines the importance of prudence in policy formulation. This reflects a balanced approach, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making while managing the risks and uncertainties inherent in economic forecasting."
2,several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is concern about inflation not reaching the Committee's objective due to external factors such as a strong dollar and its effect on commodity prices, as well as a slow response of inflation to tighter resource utilization. This implies that the Committee might consider maintaining or introducing more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the rise of inflation towards their target, rather than tightening monetary policy."
2,"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of financial stability in achieving the Federal Reserve's goals of maximum employment and price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a principle learned from past experience. The focus on financial stability as a prerequisite for their statutory goals is a general policy stance and does not suggest an immediate action towards either raising or lowering interest rates."
1,"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive employment situation with millions of new jobs created and a low unemployment rate that has been sustained over two years. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a status update on employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. The statement is factual and does not suggest a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"At the same time, the incentive to take advantage of increasingly efficient high-tech equipment and software typically available at declining prices would continue to provide an important underpinning for further large gains in investment spending, with favorable implications for continued rapid growth in productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where technological advancements and declining prices for high-tech equipment are expected to support further investment spending and productivity growth. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an observation on economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. It reflects an expectation of positive economic trends without suggesting immediate action by the FOMC."
2,"Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook on business investment growth due to favorable factors such as attractive pricing, technological improvements, and the availability of financing. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic conditions. The mention of these favorable conditions suggests that the FOMC sees a supportive environment for business investment, which is consistent with their goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not imply an immediate need for policy adjustment."
2,"Clearly, businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable, and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in turn were helping to offset rising compensation and to maintain profit margins in highly competitive markets.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that businesses are experiencing high profitability and productivity gains, which are helping to offset rising compensation costs and maintain profit margins. This indicates a strong economy where businesses are able to absorb higher costs without reducing their profit margins, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that rising expectations of inflation could lead to higher actual inflation. This implies a concern for inflationary pressures, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, with the goal of maintaining price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"For example, the evidence suggests that changes in the demographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that government programs, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses factors that influence the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU), which is a theoretical level of unemployment below which inflation would be expected to rise. It does not directly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of underlying economic factors that could affect their policy decisions. The mention of demographic changes and government programs as factors influencing NAIRU suggests a focus on understanding the economy rather than signaling a specific policy direction."
0,"The Committee also reiterated that it would continue its asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to continue asset purchases and the use of other policy tools until there is a substantial improvement in the labor market, within a context of price stability. This suggests a willingness to maintain or increase monetary accommodation to support employment, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity. The focus on improving the labor market without immediate concern for inflationary pressures implies a preference for supporting growth and employment over tightening policy to prevent inflation."
0,"And no, we’re not—we, we have not at all changed our view, and I haven’t changed my view that inflation running above 2 percent, moderately above 2 percent, is a desirable thing.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an acceptance of inflation running moderately above the 2% target, which suggests that the speaker is not inclined to advocate for immediate tightening measures to bring inflation down to the target. However, the context of this statement is crucial. If the current inflation rate is significantly above 2%, the statement could be seen as hawkish because it implies a tolerance for higher inflation and, therefore, a potential delay in implementing contractionary measures. On the other hand, if inflation is near or just above 2%, the statement could be interpreted as neutral or even dovish, as it would align with the FOMC's flexible average inflation targeting framework, which allows for periods of above-target inflation following periods of below-target inflation.

Given the lack of context about the current inflation rate and economic conditions, the classification is somewhat speculative. However, the statement's content, which expresses a view that moderately higher inflation is desirable, leans toward a hawkish interpretation, as it suggests a willingness to let inflation run hotter without immediate policy intervention."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective that does not explicitly signal a change in policy stance."
0,"As a result, the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased, and yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury coupon securities fell.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that investors are expecting a more rapid and extensive easing of monetary policy, which is typically associated with lower interest rates. The decline in yields on both nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities further suggests that the market is anticipating a dovish shift, which aligns with a policy stance that supports economic growth and is generally associated with efforts to stimulate the economy, possibly in response to lower inflation or weaker employment growth. This would be in line with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if there are concerns about economic slowdown or deflationary pressures."
2,"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to ""look through"" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the considerations that monetary policymakers must take into account when assessing the impact of disasters on the economy. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the need for careful assessment of the situation. The focus is on understanding the persistence and breadth of the effects of disasters to make informed decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the slow growth of monetary aggregates (such as money supply) indicates that the current monetary policy is not too stimulative or loose. This suggests that there may be no need for further easing of the policy, and it could even hint at a potential for tightening to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In the United States, evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices have been an integral part of the development of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general approach to monetary policy development that includes considering the effects of balance sheet adjustments and asset price changes on the economy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather reflects a comprehensive and balanced analysis as part of the policy-making process. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on a wide range of economic indicators."
0,"As was highlighted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this figure likely understates the extent of unemployment; accounting for the unusually large number of workers who reported themselves as employed but absent from their jobs would raise the unemployment rate by about 3 percentage points.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a statistical anomaly in the measurement of unemployment, rather than directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that the official unemployment rate may not fully capture the actual extent of unemployment, but it does not in itself advocate for a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might use this information to inform their decisions, but the sentence is focused on providing a more accurate picture of the labor market rather than suggesting a specific policy direction."
1,"Nonetheless, given a recovery in U. S. domestic demand approximating their current forecasts, growth in imports likely would exceed that of exports by a wide margin over the forecast horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation regarding trade dynamics, with imports expected to grow more than exports, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a neutral observation that could have various implications for the economy, depending on the context and how this trade imbalance might affect employment, inflation, and interest rates. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any immediate adjustments to monetary policy."
2,"However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, indicators of economic activity in Japan and Brazil remained weak."" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of U.S. monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides an observation of economic conditions in other countries, which might be considered in the broader context of global economic conditions. This information could potentially influence the FOMC's policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action. It is more of a neutral statement reflecting part of the economic landscape the FOMC might consider when making decisions to achieve its domestic objectives."
0,"In addition, to address the sizable demand for dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions, the FOMC authorized the expansion of its existing swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank; by the end of the intermeeting period, the formal quantity limits on these lines had been eliminated.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking action to increase the availability of dollar funding in foreign jurisdictions by expanding swap lines with the European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank, and even removing formal quantity limits. This action is aimed at easing monetary conditions by providing liquidity, which is a dovish policy stance typically associated with stimulating economic activity and supporting financial markets during times of stress. It does not suggest tightening of monetary policy, but rather an easing to ensure stable financial conditions."
1,"While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy by mentioning the moderation of asset purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate. These actions typically signify a move to cool down the economy and are consistent with a hawkish approach to control inflation and maintain stable prices, in line with the FOMC's goals. The mention of potential effects on capital flows, interest rates, and asset prices in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) acknowledges the global impact of such policy changes, but the focus remains on the intent to adjust policy in a tightening direction."
2,"Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight over the intermeeting period, though signs of easing continued to emerge amid further gains in house prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of mortgage credit conditions and the housing market without directly indicating a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges some easing in credit conditions and rising house prices, which could be seen as a balanced view of the market, reflecting neither a clear concern about inflation (which would be hawkish) nor a signal of a need for monetary stimulus (which would be dovish). The statement is more of an observation of current conditions rather than a policy stance."
2,"Some members nonetheless referred to indications of increasing expenditures for various categories of high-tech equipment and software, and they noted that impetus to demand from a positive outcome in the war against Iraq should have a favorable effect on business capital spending, especially if it were accompanied by a rally in the stock market.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that members of the FOMC are observing signs of increased spending in high-tech equipment and software, and they anticipate that a positive outcome in the war against Iraq could further boost business capital spending, particularly if it is supported by a stock market rally. This implies expectations of economic growth and increased investment, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the impact of policy measures on unemployment statistics without directly suggesting a future course of monetary policy action. It indicates that emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have influenced the unemployment rate by affecting labor force participation, but it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on understanding the labor market dynamics rather than signaling a change in monetary policy stance."
0,"The Committee's accompanying statement noted that economic growth had slowed over the course of the year, partly reflecting a substantial cooling of the housing market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in economic growth and a cooling of the housing market, without directly suggesting an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's role in monitoring economic indicators but does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. The statement is simply providing context on the economic situation, which is a neutral action in terms of policy stance."
2,"Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of indexed bonds and how their returns are tied to price indexes, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather comments on the nature of indexed bonds and their relation to inflation expectations. This statement is more about the financial instruments and market perceptions than about the FOMC's policy stance."
2,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the FOMC's decision to maintain the federal funds rate target range and the language used in their statement were expected by market participants and did not cause significant market movements. This indicates that the FOMC's actions were in line with market expectations and did not signal a clear shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of the term ""extended period"" suggests a commitment to maintaining the current policy stance for a while, but without additional context, it does not clearly indicate a hawkish or dovish direction."
0,"Long-term sovereign bond yields declined notably in the advanced economies, in part as foreign central banks announced additional monetary policy easing measures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of market conditions, specifically the decline in long-term sovereign bond yields due to monetary policy easing by foreign central banks. It does not directly indicate the Federal Reserve's stance on its own monetary policy but rather reports on the actions of other central banks and their effects on bond yields. This information could be used to inform the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a tightening or easing of policy by the Fed."
1,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is experiencing strong growth, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, strong economic growth might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, with longer-term interest rates already very low, there did not appear to be a need for enhanced forward guidance at this juncture or much scope for forward guidance to put additional downward pressure on yields.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current state of longer-term interest rates does not necessitate a change in the forward guidance, which is a communication tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence market expectations about the future path of interest rates. The statement neither suggests an imminent tightening (which would be hawkish) nor an easing (which would be dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a view that the status quo is appropriate given the current conditions, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,These members expected that the target range would be maintained at this level until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that certain members of the FOMC expect to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until they are confident that the economy has overcome recent challenges and is on course to meet the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a stance of monetary easing or at least a pause in tightening, as the focus is on supporting the economy through a difficult period rather than on preventing overheating or inflation, which would be associated with a hawkish stance. The commitment to maintaining the target range until the economy is on a solid path towards the FOMC's goals implies a readiness to provide accommodative monetary conditions to aid in the recovery process."
0,U.S. inflation remains muted.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""U.S. inflation remains muted"" suggests that inflation is not currently a concern as it is low or not increasing significantly. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,"Participants expected that productivity growth would pick up as firms slowed hiring to a pace more in line with output growth but acknowledged that the improvement might be limited, particularly if business investment spending were to remain soft.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about productivity growth and its relationship with hiring and business investment but does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges potential limitations to productivity improvements, which could have implications for both employment and price stability, but it does not suggest immediate action by the FOMC. The focus is on economic analysis rather than policy prescription."
0,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed phenomenon regarding the weakening relationship between resource utilization (or unemployment) and inflation, without directly suggesting a specific monetary policy action. It indicates an understanding of economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's decisions, but it does not explicitly advocate for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about the context within which the FOMC operates rather than a clear direction on policy stance."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for efficient resource allocation and achieving maximum sustainable employment. This focus on price stability often implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to control inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The statement suggests that maintaining low and stable inflation is a priority, which could lead to actions such as raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests uncertainty about future inflation trends, which could lead to either an increase or decrease in policy intervention depending on how the situation evolves. The focus on the uncertainty of inflation's trajectory implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative stance on monetary policy for a significant period even after the conclusion of its asset purchase program and as the economic recovery gains strength. This suggests a commitment to easing monetary policy to support employment and stabilize prices, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes stimulating economic growth and employment over concerns of potential inflation that might result from such accommodative measures."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports on trade activity, which can be influenced by a variety of factors, including exchange rates, global demand, and relative production costs. While trade deficits can have implications for the economy, this statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate monetary policy action by the FOMC to either tighten or ease conditions. It is a factual statement about economic conditions without a clear directional signal on policy."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to correct market prices if they are based on misconceptions about the economy or the Federal Reserve's intentions. This suggests that the FOMC is prepared to take action, likely in the form of tightening monetary policy, to ensure that market expectations align with their views and objectives. The reference to providing an ""anchor"" implies a commitment to stabilizing prices, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation and maintaining credibility in their inflation target."
0,"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of lower oil prices on commodity-exporting countries and the subsequent spillover effects on the global economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on external economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus is on the observation of international economic developments rather than a clear direction for domestic monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Martin Baily and Robert Lawrence (2004) present a much more thorough analysis of this issue and come to a similar conclusion.4 To investigate further the relationship between restructuring and labor productivity, we compared the performance of industry employment to the performance of industry productivity for the period from 2000 to 2002 (chart 5).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing an analysis of the relationship between restructuring and labor productivity, comparing industry employment to industry productivity. This is a factual statement about research findings and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the FOMC's position regarding adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition regarding credit availability and housing prices, without directly indicating a future policy action or stance. It simply states that those with access to credit can afford more house due to lower prices, which does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the market rather than a commitment to adjust monetary policy."
2,Inflation expectations that currently appeared by various measures and survey results to be essentially flat or even to have declined a bit were reinforcing the factors holding down price increases.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations are stable or slightly declining, which suggests that there is less pressure on prices to increase. This could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, as the current situation seems to be under control or improving in terms of price stability. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it leans towards a more accommodative policy or maintaining the current policy without tightening."
0,Recent data on core consumer prices led the staff to mark down slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff has revised its forecast for core PCE inflation downward based on recent data, suggesting that inflation pressures may be less than previously anticipated. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat higher inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to encourage employment and economic growth, as long as inflation is not a concern."
1,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is above its historical average, which suggests that monetary policy is tighter than usual. A higher federal funds rate typically corresponds to a tightening of monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation and cooling economic activity, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of strengthening household demand due to increased equity prices and fiscal policy support, which does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a commitment to adjust monetary policy in response to those conditions."
2,"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general effects of surprise monetary policy actions on stock prices without indicating a current or future direction of policy. It explains that a surprise tightening of policy would raise the risk premium and lower stock prices, while a surprise easing would lower the risk premium and raise stock prices. This statement is simply an observation of market mechanics and does not suggest an imminent policy move towards either tightening or easing."
0,Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an expectation regarding fiscal policy and its impact on economic growth. This statement is more of an economic outlook rather than a clear indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either raise or lower interest rates or adjust its balance sheet policies in response to fiscal policy expectations. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"Although the pace of job losses was moderating, the unusually large fraction of those who were working part time for economic reasons and the unusually low level of the average workweek pointed to only a gradual decline in the unemployment rate as the economic recovery proceeded.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite a slowdown in job losses, there are still signs of labor market weakness, such as a high number of people working part-time for economic reasons and a low average workweek. This indicates that the unemployment rate may only decrease slowly as the economy recovers. The dovish stance is implied as the FOMC may be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support employment and hasten the recovery process, consistent with their mandate of maximum employment."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, indicating no significant change in the economic conditions or outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather implies a steady state of economic conditions."
1,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering additional firming (tightening) of monetary policy to address risks related to inflation and economic growth. The use of the term ""firming"" typically refers to actions such as raising interest rates, which are taken to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The statement suggests that if incoming information implies that inflation is rising or economic growth is too rapid, the FOMC may increase interest rates or take other measures to tighten monetary policy. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which prioritizes controlling inflation and may involve tightening monetary policy even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
2,"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a principle from economic literature regarding the appropriate response to uncertainty in monetary policy, rather than indicating a current policy stance or future policy action. It reflects a theoretical approach to policy-making under uncertainty, suggesting that policymakers should be cautious when the effects of monetary actions on real activity and inflation are unclear. This does not directly signal an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather informs the approach to decision-making."
1,"At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the economy is performing in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It implies that the current state of the economy is close to the Committee's objectives, suggesting a balanced approach without the need for immediate policy adjustments."
1,"The asset purchases are about creating some near-term momentum in the economy, trying to strengthen growth and job creation in the near term, and the increases in the federal funds rate target, when they ultimately occur, are about reducing accommodation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a two-phase approach to monetary policy: initially, asset purchases are used to stimulate the economy and support growth and job creation, which is typically a dovish stance. However, the latter part of the sentence refers to future increases in the federal funds rate target as a means of ""reducing accommodation."" This implies a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a hawkish stance. Since the focus of the sentence is on the eventual increase in interest rates to reduce monetary policy accommodation, the overall stance is hawkish."
0,"By getting unemployment down, we hope to bring back to work some of the people who’ve been out of work as long as they have and, in that respect, try to avoid the longer-term consequences of people being out of work for months at a time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing unemployment and mitigating the long-term negative effects of extended joblessness. This suggests a willingness to maintain or implement more accommodative monetary policy measures to support job creation and economic recovery, which aligns with a dovish stance. The emphasis on bringing people back to work aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, one of its key objectives."
0,A number of participants indicated that the Committee should resume asset purchases only if substantially adverse economic circumstances warranted greater monetary policy accommodation than could be provided by lowering the federal funds rate to the effective lower bound.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants would consider resuming asset purchases only in the event of significantly adverse economic conditions that require more accommodation than can be achieved by merely lowering the federal funds rate to its effective lower bound. This implies a stance where the default position is not to engage in further monetary easing through asset purchases unless the economic situation deteriorates markedly, indicating a bias towards tightening or at least not further loosening monetary policy unless absolutely necessary. This can be seen as a hawkish stance because it sets a high threshold for additional easing measures."
2,"In its March forecast, the staff's projection for real GDP growth over the medium term was somewhat higher than the one presented in January, mostly reflecting an improved outlook for economic activity abroad, a lower foreign exchange value for the dollar, and a higher projected path of equity prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an updated economic forecast that is more optimistic than the previous one, due to improvements in international economic conditions, a weaker dollar, and rising equity prices. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic factors that could influence future policy decisions. It reflects a balanced view of the economic outlook without suggesting immediate action to adjust monetary policy."
2,"King (1999) shows that, if a long enough interval is given to hit the target, there may be little difference between a price level target and an inflation rate target.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the theoretical implications of different monetary policy targets (price level vs. inflation rate) over a long time horizon, rather than indicating a current stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides an analysis of how these targets might function similarly if given enough time. This is a conceptual point and does not directly reflect on the current goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a change in policy in response to current economic conditions."
2,They noted that the realization of such a development could make it harder for the Committee to achieve 2 percent inflation over the longer run.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concern about the difficulty in achieving the 2 percent inflation target, suggesting that inflation is currently below the desired level. This could indicate a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling further and to steer it back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance."
1,"Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes positive economic indicators, such as solid holiday shopping and increased demand for home furnishings and construction materials due to improvements in the housing market. This information does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather provides a snapshot of economic conditions. The FOMC might use such data to assess the health of the economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest an imminent change in policy stance. It reflects economic activity that could be consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without implying a need for policy adjustment."
2,Monetary policy has an ambiguous effect on trade imbalances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Monetary policy has an ambiguous effect on trade imbalances"" does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation or assessment of the impact of monetary policy on trade imbalances without suggesting a specific policy action or change. It is a statement of fact rather than a signal of future policy moves, and thus it is classified as neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,"Thus, knowing where productivity growth is headed is, in many respects, equivalent to foreseeing our economic destinies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general statement about the importance of productivity growth for the economy's future. It does not provide specific guidance on the direction of future monetary policy adjustments."
0,"But, as a consequence of low interest rates, the servicing requirement for that debt relative to homeowners' income is roughly in line with the historical average.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while interest rates are low, the debt servicing requirement as a proportion of homeowners' income remains consistent with historical averages. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting upward pressure on inflation through excessive borrowing nor is it too restrictive, as the debt burden is manageable for homeowners. It reflects a balanced view of the current economic situation without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,Together these structural changes would imply that the economy can now operate at a lower unemployment rate and at a higher growth rate than previously without inflationary consequences.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a reassessment of the economic conditions that can be sustained without leading to inflation, indicating a change in the understanding of the relationship between unemployment, growth, and inflation. It does not directly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation that could inform future policy decisions. The statement is balanced, reflecting an updated view on the economy's potential without committing to a specific monetary policy direction."
2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the stock market is performing well (which is generally outside the direct influence of monetary policy), core inflation has moderated, which suggests that inflation pressures are not intensifying. This could imply that the current monetary policy stance is effectively balancing the FOMC's goals of stable prices without necessarily indicating a need for immediate policy adjustment either towards tightening or easing. The sentence does not explicitly suggest a shift in policy but rather an observation of economic conditions."
2,"One participant suggested that the Committee could announce an additional, lower set of thresholds for inflation and unemployment","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a Committee member is proposing the introduction of lower thresholds for inflation and unemployment, which would likely lead to a tightening of monetary policy sooner than with higher thresholds. Lower thresholds could mean that the FOMC would be more inclined to raise interest rates or take other contractionary actions to prevent inflation from rising above the new, lower target or to address unemployment falling below the new threshold, both of which are indicative of a hawkish stance."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It states the Committee's broad goals of fostering maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its statutory mandate. The sentence does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms its ongoing objectives."
2,"While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring economic indicators such as unit labor costs and profit margins, which could influence future policy decisions. However, it does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of ""robust"" productivity growth is a positive sign, but the call for ""careful attention"" to other developments suggests a wait-and-see approach, aligning with a balanced or neutral stance."
2,"However, nothing prevents a central bank from switching its focus from the price of reserves to the quantity or growth of reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states that a central bank has the flexibility to shift its focus from the price of reserves (interest rates) to the quantity or growth of reserves, which is a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation. This flexibility is inherent in central banking and does not by itself suggest a preference for more hawkish or dovish policy actions. It reflects the central bank's ability to adjust its tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"More fundamentally, however, the members believed that current growth in aggregate demand, should it persist, would continue to exceed the expansion of potential output and, by putting added pressure on already tight labor markets, would at some point foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economic expansion.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that persistent growth in aggregate demand exceeding the expansion of potential output could lead to inflationary pressures due to tight labor markets. This suggests that the FOMC members are considering the possibility of tightening monetary policy to prevent such imbalances and maintain economic stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Homebuilding was forecast to decline somewhat but to stabilize at a relatively high level in the context of continued income growth and the generally favorable cash-flow affordability of home ownership.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of a slight decline in homebuilding, but it also anticipates stabilization at a high level due to positive factors such as income growth and affordability. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the housing market conditions. It suggests a balanced view of the economic situation without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates."" does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It merely indicates that the speaker is about to address a topic related to exchange rates, without offering any insight into whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, or maintaining its current stance. Exchange rates can be affected by monetary policy decisions, but this sentence does not reveal the FOMC's position on such decisions."
2,"Although some of the recent data on economic activity had been better than anticipated, most participants saw the incoming information as broadly in line with their earlier projections for moderate growth; accordingly, their views on the economic outlook had not changed appreciably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while some economic data has been better than expected, the overall view of the economic outlook among most participants remains unchanged, with expectations for moderate growth. This suggests that the FOMC's stance is neither leaning towards tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy, but rather maintaining their current policy stance based on the information available. The use of the word ""moderate"" implies a balanced approach consistent with their long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,"Of course, the basic problem in tackling the inflation of the 1970s is that we have one observation and many competing theories.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on the challenges of addressing inflation in the past, specifically in the 1970s, and does not directly indicate a current policy stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. It speaks to the complexity of economic analysis and the difficulty in choosing the correct approach when historical data is limited and theories are numerous. This statement does not provide information on current or future policy actions but rather comments on the challenges faced in a historical context."
2,"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions where investment performance is improving and business spending is increasing, which could balance out a moderation in household spending growth. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic situation. It suggests that the economy is experiencing a shift in the components of growth but does not imply an immediate need for a policy change to address inflation or employment concerns."
2,"To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (2007) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the reliability and performance of real-time staff forecasts of inflation compared to statistical benchmarks, as presented in a study by Faust and Wright (2007). It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the effectiveness of forecasting methods. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on a range of indicators, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,"the approach can be applied equally well by ""inflation hawks,"" ""growth hawks,"" and anyone in between.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it suggests that the approach of the FOMC can be utilized by members with different priorities, whether they are more concerned with controlling inflation (""inflation hawks"") or promoting growth (""growth hawks""). This indicates a balanced perspective that can accommodate a range of views within the Committee, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of central bank independence in the context of achieving price stability, suggesting that a government mandate for price stability can protect the central bank's commitment to this goal. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the structural aspect of central bank governance and its objectives. The sentence emphasizes the importance of a clear mandate for maintaining price stability, which is one of the FOMC's goals, but does not provide information on immediate policy direction."
2,"however, for the two months combined, the deficit was considerably wider than its average rate for the second quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the size of the deficit over a specific period compared to its average rate in the previous quarter, which is a fiscal policy outcome rather than a direct indicator of monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such information in its broader economic analysis, but the sentence itself does not indicate a clear direction towards hawkish or dovish policy adjustments. It is more of a statement of economic condition without a direct implication for immediate monetary policy action."
0,"In fact, the low funds rate has been necessary to promote growth that, to date, has been just sufficient to begin reducing substantial margins of slack in resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that a low federal funds rate has been essential to stimulate economic growth, which has only just started to reduce the significant underutilization of resources. This suggests that the FOMC is maintaining an accommodative stance to support the economy and move towards full employment, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy that favors easing rather than tightening."
2,"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to providing information to the public about inflation projections and the distinction between short-term shocks and longer-term trends. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather focuses on the communication aspect of the FOMC's policy strategy. The aim is to help the public understand and plan based on the expected trajectory of inflation, which is a part of the FOMC's commitment to transparency. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates but does not signal a specific policy action."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a significant increase in nonfarm payroll employment, which suggests a strengthening labor market. A strong labor market could lead to upward pressures on wages and potentially increase inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could signal a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply explains the importance of the goal of maximizing employment without indicating a direction for monetary policy change. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms one of their objectives."
0,"A Framework for Analyzing the Growth of Labor ProductivityA great success story for the American economy has been the resurgence of productivity growth that began around 1995.1 From 1973 to 1995, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical context regarding labor productivity growth in the American economy, specifically mentioning the period of resurgence that began around 1995. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy, nor does it suggest any immediate actions to be taken by the FOMC in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence is more of an economic observation rather than a policy directive or indication of future policy moves."
2,"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where a model predicted deflation based on the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth, but it does not directly indicate whether the FOMC would respond by tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of ""judgmental adjustments"" suggests that the FOMC might not take the model's prediction at face value, indicating a balanced approach that weighs various factors and indicators before deciding on a policy stance. The sentence reflects the Committee's commitment to using a range of indicators and adjusting policy as necessary, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past market reaction to an employment report, rather than indicating a future policy direction. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reports on currency fluctuations in response to economic data. The focus on currency strength does not directly relate to the FOMC's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external factors (the fiscal situation in some European nations) are affecting global economic growth and financial stability, leading to ""flight-to-quality"" flows, which typically means investors are moving towards safer assets. This observation is a statement of fact regarding market conditions and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's awareness of international developments that could impact the U.S. economy but does not suggest an immediate policy response."
1,"Nonetheless, all but one of the members believed that in light of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, an immediate policy tightening was not needed in the absence of firmer indications that inflationary pressures might be emerging.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the majority of the members are not in favor of immediate policy tightening, suggesting they are waiting for clearer signs of inflation before taking action. This stance leans towards maintaining or easing the current monetary policy rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach. The members are showing caution and a willingness to keep policy accommodative in the face of economic uncertainties, which is consistent with a dovish stance that prioritizes supporting employment and economic growth until there is more concrete evidence of inflationary pressures."
2,"Therefore, monetary policy in Japan might be affected not only by views about how such policies would affect macroeconomic performance, for given fiscal policies,","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of monetary policy in Japan in relation to fiscal policies without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that monetary policy decisions might be influenced by their expected macroeconomic outcomes, considering the fiscal environment, but does not provide information on whether the policy stance would be more hawkish or dovish. The focus is on the interaction between monetary and fiscal policies rather than a specific policy direction."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October"" is a factual statement about employment trends without a clear indication of a policy shift. It suggests that employment is growing, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, without additional context on how this employment growth relates to inflation or the broader economic outlook, it does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reports on economic conditions, which is a neutral stance in terms of policy direction."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical assumptions about productivity growth and labor force growth, which are factors in the overall economic environment that the FOMC considers. However, it does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease policy. It is simply a statement of past conditions without a clear implication for future policy moves."
2,"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various factors that are supporting consumer spending, which is a component of economic activity, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and retail discounting are external economic factors that can influence consumer behavior, but the sentence does not suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy in response to these factors. It simply states observations that could be part of the broader economic context the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
1,"the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook for housing activity based on strong economic expansion, income growth, and attractive mortgage rates. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions. The mention of ""relatively attractive mortgage interest rates"" suggests that rates are not at a level that would warrant concern for overheating, nor are they so low as to suggest an immediate need for policy easing. The overall tone is balanced, reflecting an environment that is neither exerting pressure for a change in policy stance nor indicating complacency about potential risks."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a move towards tightening monetary policy (""an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy"") with the intention of controlling inflation and bringing it down to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. This suggests a commitment to reducing inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects inflation to be higher than previously anticipated due to sustained upward pressure from import and commodity prices. This suggests a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges factors that could impact the economy but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The mention of uncertainties like elections and oil prices reflects an awareness of external factors that could influence economic conditions, but it does not provide information on how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish direction."
0,"The weakness in labor market conditions remained an important concern to meeting participants, with unemployment expected to remain elevated for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC meeting participants are concerned about weak labor market conditions and expect high unemployment to persist, which suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support job creation and economic recovery. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, one of its key goals."
0,"Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both total and core inflation rates are expected to remain below the FOMC's 2% target, despite a slight projected increase. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. The expectation that low inflation is transitory and will continue to run below the target aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests that the FOMC may be more inclined to maintain or ease monetary policy to support economic activity and move inflation towards its goal."
2,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had moderated from its strong fourth-quarter pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of economic conditions, noting a moderation in household spending growth but also acknowledging strong growth in business fixed investment. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather presents a mixed view of economic activity. This balanced perspective does not clearly indicate a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the influences on the short end of the yield curve, acknowledging that it is affected by monetary policy and cyclical factors. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an understanding of how monetary policy can influence interest rates, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of transparency and informed decision-making."
2,"In their review of developments in key sectors of the economy, members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC members' observation of the economy, noting the strength in household spending and its role in balancing weaker areas of economic activity. This statement does not directly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions. It suggests that while there are weak spots in the economy, strong household spending is helping to mitigate these weaknesses, which could imply a wait-and-see approach or a balanced stance in terms of monetary policy."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have reached a consensus to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, suggesting that they believe the existing policy is suitable for achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This decision reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing."
2,"Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Labor productivity growth slowed to an average pace of 1.4 percent per year over this period"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding economic conditions, specifically labor productivity growth, which is one aspect of economic performance that the FOMC might consider. However, without additional context on how this productivity growth relates to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, or how it might influence the Committee's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
0,"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential feedback loop where declines in wealth could negatively impact economic activity, which in turn could affect financial markets. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges a risk scenario that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions. It reflects the Committee's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators and balancing risks when formulating policy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish position."
2,Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Recent data pointed to little change in underlying inflation trends"" suggests that inflation is neither accelerating nor decelerating significantly, which implies that the current monetary policy stance may be appropriate to maintain the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not clearly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
1,"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about high inflation levels and acknowledges uncertainty about the inflation outlook. This suggests a stance that would favor tightening monetary policy to bring inflation down towards the FOMC's target, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to reduce inflationary pressures."
2,"For example, monetary policy makers might attempt to influence market expectations of future short rates as an alternative to changing the current setting of the overnight rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that the monetary policymakers might use, which is influencing market expectations of future short-term interest rates, as an alternative to immediate changes in the overnight rate. This statement does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses a potential method of conducting policy, which could be used in either a hawkish or dovish context depending on the economic conditions and the goals of the FOMC. The sentence is more about the tools and communication strategies of monetary policy rather than a clear direction of policy adjustment."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will monitor monetary aggregates (such as money supply) alongside economic and financial developments to assess progress toward price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an ongoing evaluative approach. The mention of ""progress toward price level stability"" aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, but without a clear direction on whether policy will become more restrictive or accommodative, the stance is neutral."
2,"Some participants suggested that shifts of funds from abroad into U. S. Treasury securities may have put downward pressure on term premiums; the shifts, in turn, may have reflected in part a reaction to declines in foreign sovereign yields in response to actual and anticipated monetary policy actions abroad.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external factors, specifically international monetary policy actions, are influencing U.S. Treasury security yields through capital flows. It does not directly indicate a stance of the FOMC towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather observes the impact of global financial conditions on U.S. markets. The FOMC is acknowledging the influence of nonmonetary factors on the U.S. financial system, which is consistent with their commitment to transparency and informed decision-making based on a range of indicators."
2,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that one member of the FOMC did not see the need for further policy accommodation because they did not expect any significant impact on economic growth and unemployment, and they did not agree with the assessment that the economic activity and inflation outlook warranted such action. This stance suggests a preference against easing monetary policy, which is typically considered a hawkish position, as it implies maintaining or increasing the current level of monetary policy tightness rather than loosening it."
0,And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.,"HAWKISH

The sentence reflects on the historical context of achieving low inflation through significant monetary tightening, which involved high interest rates and high unemployment. This retrospective view emphasizes the importance of maintaining low inflation, suggesting a stance that would favor measures to prevent inflation from rising, even at the cost of higher interest rates and potentially higher unemployment. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which prioritizes inflation control, often through tightening monetary policy."
0,"still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy is expected to remain ""highly accommodative,"" which typically means that the Federal Reserve is inclined to keep interest rates low to stimulate the economy. This dovish stance is supportive of economic growth and suggests that the FOMC is not currently focused on tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, but rather on promoting maximum employment and supporting the economy. The reference to historically low unemployment levels implies that the FOMC is prioritizing its employment mandate over immediate concerns about inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach."
1,"When interest rates increase, prices will undoubtedly adjust to some extent--in some cases simply by rising less rapidly than they would otherwise--and debt-service obligations will move up.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that interest rates are increasing, which is typically a sign of tightening monetary policy. The acknowledgment that prices will adjust, potentially rising less rapidly, and that debt-service obligations will increase, suggests measures are being taken to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to cool down the economy and achieve stable prices."
2,"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the transitory nature of certain inflationary pressures and their long-term impact, which hinges on the stability of the public's inflation expectations. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of anchored inflation expectations for long-term price stability. This reflects a balanced view on how external factors affect inflation without indicating a clear direction for policy change."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising energy and commodity prices leading to higher inflation and lower growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, even at the risk of further slowing growth, aligning with a hawkish stance focused on price stability."
2,"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between stock prices and home sales, noting their correlation and the influence of interest rates on both. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how certain economic indicators might interact with each other, which is part of the broader economic analysis the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
0,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the current economic growth rate of 2.8 percent is significantly higher than the potential growth rate estimated to be around 1.75 percent. This could suggest that the economy is growing faster than its potential, which may lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such a situation might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,several expected that declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar in recent months would also likely help return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the depreciation of the dollar is expected to contribute to bringing inflation back to the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This implies that the current monetary policy stance is supportive of or could lead to a weaker dollar, which in turn could help increase inflation to the desired level. It does not indicate a need for tightening monetary policy, but rather an expectation that existing conditions will help achieve the inflation goal, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
1,Members also expressed concern about the potential for an increase in inflation expectations given highly stimulative macroeconomic policies and economic growth that seemed to be gathering momentum.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are worried about rising inflation expectations due to very stimulative macroeconomic policies and accelerating economic growth. This concern suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce economic stimulus."
2,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" if the unemployment rate declines to the projected 3.8 percent by the end of 2022. This suggests that the labor market is strong and nearing the FOMC's employment goal, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to control inflationary pressures that often accompany low unemployment rates. The focus on achieving maximum employment without mentioning concerns about low employment or economic weakness implies a stance that is more on the side of preventing the economy from running too hot, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' forecasts for economic growth, stating that their expectations have not changed significantly from previous projections and that they anticipate a gradual strengthening of the recovery. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a steady outlook on economic growth. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real interest rate, with a focus on the economic theory behind these dynamics. It does not directly indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it describes a scenario where different economic factors could balance each other out, which is a neutral analysis of economic conditions without a direct policy prescription."
2,"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's projection of inflation aligns with the mandate-consistent inflation rate, suggesting that the current macroeconomic environment is in line with the FOMC's long-term inflation target. This implies neither an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather to maintain the current stance, as the projected inflation does not deviate from the Committee's goal."
1,"In any case, the real federal funds rate is now lower than prior to the easings, at the same time that the unemployment rate is lower and projected growth higher than it was prior to the easings.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is lower than before the monetary policy easings, while the unemployment rate is also lower and projected growth is higher than before the easings. This suggests that the economy is stronger now, with higher growth and lower unemployment, which could lead to inflationary pressures. The lower real federal funds rate in this context might imply that there is room for an increase in interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that favors tightening monetary policy to maintain price stability."
1,"However, we now know that an unexpected and unrecognized slowdown in productivity growth occurred in 1973.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about productivity growth in the past (1973) and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment nor provides a clear direction on the future path of interest rates. The focus on past productivity growth does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish stance but rather reflects an analysis of economic conditions that could inform policy decisions."
0,"We have not focused on whether we meet the liftoff test, because we don’t meet the liftoff test now because we’re not at maximum employment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not considering raising interest rates (liftoff) because the condition of maximum employment has not been met. This suggests a stance towards maintaining or potentially easing monetary policy to support further improvements in employment, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes economic growth and job creation over immediate concerns about inflation."
2,"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a research finding on the relationship between U.S. short-term interest rates and euro area bond yields, rather than directly indicating a current or future stance of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on the FOMC's policy intentions. Instead, it offers an observation on international financial linkages, which may be one of many considerations in the Committee's decision-making process."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where GDP growth variance decreased and inflation rates fell from high levels. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a retrospective observation of economic conditions, which does not inherently suggest an immediate action or change in monetary policy."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of economic condition regarding productivity levels. Low productivity could have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral. It does not inherently suggest an immediate need for a policy change to either tighten or ease conditions."
2,"Relative to the average episode, commercial real estate prices neither fell much during the recession nor rose a lot during the expansion.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about commercial real estate prices, noting that they did not experience significant declines during a recession or substantial increases during an expansion. This statement does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of past market conditions in the commercial real estate sector, which is one of the many economic indicators the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. It does not explicitly suggest a need to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation on the central bank's influence over monetary services and competition among currencies. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the structural changes in the financial environment that the central bank operates within. This reflects an understanding of the broader economic context rather than a specific policy direction."
2,Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to past economic events and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease the monetary policy but rather sets the stage for a discussion or analysis of past economic conditions."
0,"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges an improving labor market but also points out the challenge of labor shortages, which can be a constraint on hiring and economic growth. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes current economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"We have continued to provide guidance, the same guidance that we have for some time, that says the Committee “anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” I know that’s a mouthful, but it says, in effect, that the Committee believes that the economic conditions that have made recovery difficult, we’re getting beyond them.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is willing to keep the target federal funds rate below what is considered normal for a longer period, even after employment and inflation levels approach the Committee's mandated objectives. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy, as the Committee signals a readiness to support the economy's recovery for an extended time, despite nearing their goals for employment and inflation. This dovish stance is aimed at fostering continued economic growth and stability, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the difficulty of predicting an asset price bubble burst, which is a complex task involving the assessment of numerous investor judgments. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on future policy actions. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of forecasting financial market movements, which is a consideration for the FOMC but not a direct indicator of their policy stance."
2,"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply an introductory remark indicating that the speaker will provide a review of the previous year before discussing the outlook and monetary policy challenges for the current year. It does not provide any information on the direction of monetary policy or the Committee's stance on economic conditions."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations, as measured by the breakevens from inflation-indexed bonds, have decreased. This could suggest that the market anticipates lower inflation in the future, which might be a result of previous tightening measures by the FOMC or expectations of future tightening. A decline in inflation expectations could provide the FOMC with more room to continue or maintain a hawkish stance to ensure that inflation moves towards the Committee's 2% target."
1,"Members recognized that from the standpoint of the level of real short-term interest rates, monetary policy could already be deemed to be fairly restrictive.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the members of the FOMC acknowledge that the real short-term interest rates are at a level that could be considered restrictive, which implies that the current monetary policy is tight. This tightness is often associated with efforts to slow down economic activity to combat inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to tighten monetary policy."
2,The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the central bank's responsibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, which suggests a commitment to tightening monetary policy if necessary to control inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it indicates a priority on price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC, even if it requires raising interest rates or taking other measures that might slow down economic growth."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects on historical economic cycles, noting that financial imbalances, rather than inflation in goods and services, were significant at the beginning of past downturns. This observation does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides context for understanding economic patterns, which could inform future policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest immediate action towards achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it imply a clear direction for adjusting the federal funds rate."
0,"Looking beyond the near term, the members anticipated that as the prevailing uncertainties began to diminish, the economy's resiliency abetted by broadly accommodative monetary and fiscal polices and the continuation of a strong uptrend in productivity would underpin a gradual economic recovery.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members have an expectation of a gradual economic recovery supported by existing accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, as well as a strong increase in productivity. This indicates a balance between supporting the economy and not signaling any immediate changes to the policy stance, as it implies a wait-and-see approach that depends on the resolution of uncertainties and the economy's inherent strength. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a continuation of the current policy to support the economy's recovery."
0,"For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is currently low and expected to remain low for some time due to weak commodity and import prices, as well as the influence of current low inflation on future price expectations. This suggests that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this stance would support maintaining or potentially easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity without the risk of triggering high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,"Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC have observed signs of increased worker demands in labor negotiations, which may be driven by the abundance of job opportunities. This suggests that the labor market is tight, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and subsequently inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,"The labor force participation rate, along with the employment-to-population ratio, increased, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of labor market conditions, specifically improvements in the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that more people are working or seeking work, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the sentence does not provide information on whether this will lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus it is considered neutral."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it give details on the direction of interest rate adjustments or other monetary tools. The focus is on the desired outcomes (price stability and sustainable growth) rather than the means to achieve them, making it a neutral statement in terms of policy stance."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC believed its current monetary policy stance was appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects at the time of the January meeting. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the existing policy settings in relation to the economic conditions at that time. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
1,"However, the volatility of these and other commodity prices is such that possible future increases in these prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential future increases in commodity prices, which could lead to higher inflation. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, which would be consistent with a response to inflationary pressures."
2,"I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a greater concern for the risk of higher inflation than other potential economic issues. This concern for inflation suggests a bias towards tightening monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to higher inflation to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a goal of returning the economy to a state of low unemployment and inflation near the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an objective the FOMC might aim for. The stance is balanced and does not indicate a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy adjustment."
1,"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general observation about consumer behavior in response to changes in home values, noting that homeowners typically experience a modest and persistent rise in home values, which they perceive to be largely permanent. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a comment on the economic backdrop against which monetary policy decisions are made, rather than a signal of any immediate policy action."
2,"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential effects of a policy option on credit flows and interest rates but does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more focused on the mechanics and possible implications of a policy tool rather than a clear direction of policy stance."
2,Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on setting the stage for a discussion on productivity and technology developments and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests imminent policy actions nor provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"But again, in terms of terminology, I guess I would reject that term for the Federal Reserve because we are going to be evenhanded in treating the price stability and maximum employment parts of our mandate on a level footing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to balance the two parts of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate: price stability and maximum employment. It does not lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes an evenhanded approach to both goals. This suggests a stance that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather one that is balanced and responsive to the economic indicators related to both inflation and employment."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could persist and become more entrenched, especially in an economy operating above its potential, which suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming more persistent. This stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests that the Committee might lean towards measures that would prevent an overheating economy, such as raising interest rates."
2,It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there was excessive risk-taking and overextension of credit in the late 1990s, which could be seen as a factor contributing to financial instability or inflationary pressures. By highlighting ""undue optimism about prospects for repayment,"" it suggests that there may have been a need for a tighter monetary policy to prevent such overshooting, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to control inflation and maintain financial stability."
0,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where reduced mortgage interest rates are balancing out the negative impact of declining financial wealth on housing demand. This indicates that there is an equilibrium being maintained between stimulative effects (lower mortgage rates) and contractionary effects (declining financial wealth), which does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates seem to be met in this scenario without indicating a clear direction for a policy change."
2,We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the structure of the U.S. government in comparison to other countries that target inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the current economic conditions or the FOMC's policy intentions. It is simply a contextual observation and does not reflect a hawkish or dovish inclination."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the limitations of the Federal Reserve's authority and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply clarifies the scope of the Fed's functions, which is unrelated to the immediate direction of monetary policy adjustments."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains a mechanism of how economic conditions can affect financial variables. The term premium is a component of interest rates that reflects the risk of holding longer-term bonds versus shorter-term bonds. This statement is more about the dynamics of financial markets and does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any imminent action to adjust the federal funds rate."
1,"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to adjusting policy to control inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy measures such as raising interest rates. This stance is aimed at achieving the FOMC's goal of stable prices and is consistent with a hawkish approach to prevent inflation from rising above the targeted level."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a balanced approach to achieving the set goals."
2,"About the same time, Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model, based on M2, which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical development of a model used by the Board staff to predict long-run inflation trends. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on the tools used to understand inflation, which is a key concern for the FOMC when making policy decisions. The P* model itself is a theoretical framework and does not convey the Committee's current policy bias."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a consequence of measures taken to restore price stability, which typically involves tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation. This stance is considered hawkish because it prioritizes combating inflation over supporting maximum employment in the short term."
2,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an observation about economic activity, specifically household spending, without suggesting an immediate need for policy adjustment. This could be interpreted as a sign of a cooling economy, which might be a concern if it persists, but on its own, it does not signal a definitive move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The FOMC might consider such information in the context of other data when deciding on policy actions to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,An anticipated sharp slowdown in the pace of inventory accumulation also would damp domestic production as the growth of stocks was brought into balance with the expected more moderate trajectory of final sales.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected change in the pace of inventory accumulation and its impact on domestic production, aligning it with the projected moderate growth of final sales. This statement is a neutral observation of economic conditions rather than a clear indication of a future policy move. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects an analysis of economic trends that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions."
0,"In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are considering a more accommodative policy stance by suggesting a lower unemployment threshold for maintaining low interest rates. This implies a willingness to keep monetary policy easy to support employment, which aligns with a dovish approach to stimulate the economy and suggests less concern about inflationary pressures at that moment."
1,The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for rising inflation pressures and suggests that further tightening actions, such as raising interest rates, might be necessary to control labor costs and prices. This stance is consistent with a monetary policy that aims to prevent inflation from rising above the target level, which is typically associated with a hawkish approach to ensure price stability."
2,"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's future decisions regarding the pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction will be based on the evolving economic conditions. This suggests a data-dependent approach, which is neither explicitly suggesting an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather a wait-and-see stance that could swing in either direction based on incoming economic data."
2,But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price"" does not provide any specific information regarding monetary policy, inflation, employment, or interest rates. It is a general statement that could reflect the challenges associated with policy changes but does not indicate a clear stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL, as it does not suggest a direction for monetary policy adjustments in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding economic conditions abroad and does not inherently suggest a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish policy in response to domestic economic conditions. The FOMC may consider this information in the context of global economic conditions, but the sentence itself does not reveal a specific policy direction."
0,"And the way I would explain it is, is that inflation that’s too low will mean that interest rates are lower.","DOVISH

The sentence implies a concern for inflation being too low, which would typically lead to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates are a sign of an easing monetary policy stance, as the central bank would be aiming to stimulate economic activity to push inflation towards its target level. This dovish stance is in line with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices with a 2% inflation target."
0,"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses historical estimates of productivity growth and expresses caution regarding the duration of such growth, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy."
2,The Outlook for Economic ActivityThe midpoint of the range of projections for real GDP growth declines noticeably from about 2-1/2 percent for 2007 to roughly 2 percent in 2008; then it returns to about 2-1/2 percent in 2009 and 2010.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a projection of real GDP growth, indicating an expected slowdown in economic activity in the near term, followed by a return to previous levels. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a commitment to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC may use such information to inform future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific direction of policy."
2,"Smoothing through these variations, average monthly job growth appears to have stepped down from last year’s strong pace, but job gains remain well above the pace necessary to provide jobs for new labor force entrants.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the average monthly job growth has slowed compared to the previous year, it is still sufficient to accommodate new entrants into the labor force. This suggests a balanced view of the labor market, neither pointing towards an overheating economy that would require tightening (hawkish) nor signaling significant slack that would necessitate easing (dovish). It reflects an economy that is growing at a steady pace without showing clear signs of imbalances that would prompt a change in monetary policy."
2,"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strong commitment to achieving price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By stating that price stability is ""fully under the control of monetary policymakers,"" it suggests that the FOMC is willing to use its tools, such as adjusting interest rates, to ensure inflation remains in check. This stance is typically considered hawkish, as it indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy to maintain stable prices, aligning with the FOMC's goal of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical example of the Federal Reserve's role in maintaining financial stability during a crisis, specifically referencing its response to the events of September 11, 2001. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather emphasizes the Fed's broader responsibilities and its capacity to respond to extraordinary events. The focus is on the Fed's ability to act as a stabilizing force during times of financial distress, which is a fundamental aspect of its mandate but does not convey a specific policy direction in terms of hawkishness or dovishness."
2,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general understanding of the lag between monetary policy implementation and its effects on the real economy, such as output and employment, while acknowledging the immediate impact on financial markets. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (neither tightening nor easing) but rather explains the timing of the effects of any policy changes. This statement is more about the mechanics of monetary policy transmission rather than a signal of the FOMC's current policy stance."
0,Some members expressed concern about the longer-run prospects for large federal deficits and their implications for the future performance of the economy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are worried about the potential negative economic impacts of large federal deficits in the long run. This concern suggests a cautious stance towards expansionary fiscal policy, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In this context, a hawkish stance would be more likely as the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary risks associated with high deficits."
2,"Nonetheless, with fiscal policy assumed to be tighter next year than this year, the staff anticipated that real GDP growth would not materially exceed increases in potential output in 2013.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that real GDP growth will align with potential output increases, suggesting a balance between economic growth and inflationary pressures. It does not explicitly signal a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather conveys an anticipation of economic conditions that are consistent with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The mention of fiscal policy being tighter implies some contractionary influence, but the overall stance of the sentence is balanced and does not advocate for a specific monetary policy direction."
0,"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the possibility that recent productivity gains could lead to a higher potential output than standard measures suggest, which would mean that the current high level of unemployment might be a more accurate indicator of economic slack. This statement is neutral because it presents a conditional scenario that could affect the interpretation of economic indicators but does not directly suggest an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view, considering both the potential for increased productivity (which could be inflationary if it leads to higher demand) and the presence of unemployment (which suggests economic slack and potentially less inflationary pressure). The FOMC might use this information to adjust policy in the future, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific direction of policy change."
2,"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the amount of inflation-protected securities outstanding and the ability to gauge real interest rates across different maturities. It does not directly indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the FOMC's use of financial indicators to inform their decisions, which is consistent with their commitment to transparency and data-driven policy-making."
2,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking a comprehensive approach by considering various economic indicators such as activity, labor market conditions, and inflation. This suggests a balanced stance, as it does not explicitly lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes ongoing assessment and consideration of a range of factors."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, suggesting that the market's long-term inflation expectations did not change significantly. This observation does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance but rather reflects market conditions and expectations at the time. The FOMC might view this stability in inflation expectations as consistent with their inflation target, thus not necessitating a change in policy stance."
0,"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about the potential risks associated with very low credit spreads, which could either lead to a sharp rise in spreads, negatively affecting aggregate demand, or continue to decline, potentially undermining financial stability. This concern about financial stability suggests a bias towards tightening monetary policy to prevent the buildup of risks in the financial system, which is a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could help mitigate the risk of financial imbalances that might arise from excessively low credit spreads."
1,All members agreed that the FOMC statement for this meeting should again indicate that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that was likely to be measured but that the Committee would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC members to signal a potential tightening of monetary policy, albeit at a measured pace. The commitment to ""remove policy accommodation"" suggests a reduction in stimulative measures, such as lowering the rate of asset purchases or raising interest rates, to prevent overheating and maintain price stability. The phrase ""as needed to maintain price stability"" underscores the FOMC's focus on controlling inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes curbing inflation over stimulating growth when necessary."
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy by suggesting a gradual removal of accommodation due to signs of a tight labor market. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, as a tight labor market could lead to wage growth and potentially higher inflation, which the Committee may aim to counteract by tightening policy."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that threaten the achievement of its goals, which include maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to changing economic conditions. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining readiness to act in either direction as necessary to pursue its objectives."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a method of approaching inflation targeting, suggesting that flexible inflation averaging might be a beneficial and more straightforward strategy to communicate. It does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather comments on a potential policy framework. The stance is balanced and does not lean towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy position."
2,"Foreign economic growth remained sluggish, restrained by weak activity in Europe and the associated spillovers--including through trade--to the rest of the world.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of foreign economic growth and its impact on global trade, particularly noting the sluggish growth due to weak activity in Europe. This statement is an observation of external economic conditions rather than an indication of the FOMC's stance on domestic monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on international factors that could influence the U.S. economy and thus the FOMC's policy decisions."
1,"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that current inflationary pressures will subside once supply bottlenecks are resolved, but it also acknowledges uncertainty regarding the timing. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, which does not clearly signal an immediate intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The stance is balanced, reflecting a recognition of the temporary nature of the inflationary pressures without committing to a policy change until more information is available."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members were considering an easing of monetary policy to support financial markets and mitigate risks to economic growth. Easing policy typically involves lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors more accommodative monetary policy to support employment and growth when there is less concern about inflationary pressures."
2,"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members believe that the risk of further significant disinflation—a decline in the inflation rate—has decreased. This suggests that there is less concern about falling prices, which could reduce the likelihood of implementing an easing monetary policy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a reduced fear of disinflation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential overheating of the economy and to keep inflation near the target rate. Therefore, the stance is more aligned with a hawkish view, where the focus is on preventing high inflation rather than stimulating the economy."
2,An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analytical perspective on understanding financial market prices by identifying risk premiums. This is part of the broader assessment process that informs the FOMC's policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions. It is a statement about the methodology of analysis rather than a policy direction."
2,"With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run above the 2 percent target temporarily to achieve the long-term average of 2 percent. This suggests a more accommodative stance, with the Committee potentially being more tolerant of higher inflation and less inclined to tighten monetary policy in the near term. The goal is to ensure that inflation expectations remain stable, which aligns with a dovish approach to support economic activity and employment."
2,So the Committee estimates that the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate is 5.0 to 5.2.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an estimate of the longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's assessment of the natural rate of unemployment that is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment, but it does not suggest any immediate policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
2,"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the housing sector, noting strong demand, moderate mortgage rates, and positive consumer sentiment. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of economic conditions related to the housing market, which is one of the many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement is balanced and does not suggest a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that certain measures of inflation (trimmed price indexes) are aligning closely with the FOMC's long-term inflation goal of 2 percent. This suggests that inflation is under control and potentially signals a reduced need for an accommodative monetary policy stance. If inflation is near the target, the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the FOMC's commitment to delivering price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By highlighting price stability as a key asset, the statement suggests a willingness to take measures to ensure inflation is kept in check, which could include tightening monetary policy. This stance aligns with a hawkish view, as it prioritizes the control of inflation, one of the FOMC's primary goals."
2,"Many members of the Committee, participants, have said that they think policy should be based on the actual evolution of economic activity and inflation, which tends to be variable over time, and that’s why I say I anticipate it will be data dependent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members' approach to policy-making will be responsive to economic data as it evolves, rather than committing to a predetermined path of tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced approach that could swing either toward a more hawkish or dovish stance depending on actual economic conditions relative to employment and inflation targets. The use of ""data dependent"" implies that the Committee is neither signaling an immediate intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather to observe and react to economic indicators as they arise."
0,"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there have been declines in payroll employment and industrial production, which suggests economic weakness. Although the declines are smaller than those earlier in the year, the fact that they are mentioned in the context of a Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement implies concern over these economic indicators. A dovish stance is typically associated with policies that support easing to stimulate the economy, and in this case, the FOMC may be inclined to implement or maintain such policies to address the shortfalls in employment, which aligns with their commitment to maximum employment. The mention of declines in key economic indicators would generally not be associated with a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish) or a completely neutral stance, as it suggests a need for potential policy action to support economic recovery."
1,"In particular, incoming data and anecdotal information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity is stronger than expected and that inflation pressures may be increasing. This suggests a potential need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to signs of increasing inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
0,"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a slight decrease in market-based measures of inflation expectations (TIPS-based inflation compensation) for the medium to long term (5 to 10 years ahead), but it does not clearly suggest a need for immediate monetary policy action. The slight edge down in inflation expectations could be interpreted as inflation being under control, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. However, without a strong indication of whether this trend is seen as positive or negative by the FOMC, or how it might influence their policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation or expectation regarding consumer spending behavior, without suggesting any particular policy action. This statement could be seen as neutral because it reflects an economic condition that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions, but it does not in itself advocate for a specific monetary policy direction."
0,"However, with monetary policy assumed to remain highly accommodative, the staff continued to anticipate that real GDP growth would outpace that of potential over much of this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects real GDP growth to exceed potential growth due to a highly accommodative monetary policy, which would lead to a decrease in unemployment to historically low levels. This scenario suggests that the economy is operating above its potential, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Certainly, if we are to remain preeminent in transforming knowledge into economic value, the U.S. system of higher education must remain the world's leader in generating scientific and technological breakthroughs and in preparing workers to meet the evolving demands for skilled labor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of the U.S. higher education system in maintaining economic leadership through scientific and technological innovation and skilled labor preparation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates that would suggest a change in the FOMC's monetary policy stance. Instead, it focuses on the broader economic context and the role of education in economic growth, which is outside the direct scope of monetary policy actions."
1,"If you look at the number of job openings compared to the number of unemployed, it’s—we’re, we’re clearly on a path to a very strong labor market with high participation, low unemployment, high employment, wages moving up across the spectrum.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong labor market characterized by high participation, low unemployment, high employment, and rising wages. This scenario suggests that the economy is heating up, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about financial imbalances potentially becoming more closely associated with the business cycle due to a combination of a low neutral interest rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation. It implies that while monetary policy might not be the sole tool to address these issues, there is an acknowledgment of the risks that financial imbalances pose to the economy. This recognition could lead to a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent such imbalances, which is in line with a hawkish approach. The statement also implies the use of other tools, which could include regulatory measures, to ensure financial stability, but the emphasis on the potential need to ""temper the financial cycle"" suggests a readiness to act, possibly by adjusting monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy."
0,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has decided to reduce interest rates, which is typically a dovish action. Lowering interest rates is a form of monetary policy easing intended to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, which can support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if the economy is showing signs of slowing down or if inflation is below the target level."
0,year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer inflation is staying at a very low level on a year-over-year basis. This suggests that inflation is not currently a concern, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, low inflation may provide room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, as long as inflation is below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
1,"In response to the resulting high inflation, the Fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in response to high inflation, which is a tightening of monetary policy typically associated with a hawkish stance. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down an overheating economy and bring down inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The mention of a weakened economy as a result of this action does not change the classification but rather indicates a potential consequence of the hawkish policy."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a balanced outlook on the economy, anticipating growth and a decline in unemployment in the second half of the year, without directly suggesting immediate policy action to either tighten or ease monetary conditions. It reflects an expectation of a gradual recovery, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"For 2000, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis in June to retain the same ranges for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1999 to the fourth quarter of 2000.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt over a specified period, which indicates a steady approach rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. This suggests a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the current economic conditions without signaling a shift in policy to counteract inflation or to stimulate the economy."
2,"Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which is a measure of wage inflation and the cost of labor. The fact that the ECI's growth rate has not returned to pre-2008 levels does not directly suggest a clear course of action for monetary policy. It does not indicate a strong inflationary pressure that would warrant a tightening of policy (hawkish), nor does it suggest significant economic weakness that would require an easing of policy (dovish). Instead, it provides an observation on labor cost trends, which could be interpreted in various ways depending on other economic conditions. Therefore, the stance is neutral as it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a slight downward revision in the economic growth forecast, specifically mentioning a slowdown in construction. This information by itself does not clearly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions that could be part of the broader analysis the FOMC uses to determine its policy stance. The mention of ""softer news on construction"" could be a concern for employment and growth, but without additional context on inflation and the broader economy, the policy implication remains unclear."
0,"Moreover, a 50 basis point reduction that was associated with the communication of a Committee view that the risks to achieving its objectives for economic activity were balanced might be mistakenly interpreted in the view of some members as a signal that the Committee had come to the end of its policy easing moves--a judgment they were not prepared to make at this time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members were concerned that a 50 basis point reduction in interest rates, if communicated as a response to balanced risks, might be misinterpreted as the end of the Committee's policy easing. The fact that members were not ready to signal an end to policy easing suggests that they were still inclined towards a stance that supports economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy. This dovish stance is aimed at stimulating the economy by lowering interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment, which can help in achieving maximum employment and stable prices when economic activity is below potential or inflation is below the target level."
0,"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. ""","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee expects to maintain the target federal funds rate below what is considered normal in the long run, even when employment and inflation are close to the FOMC's mandated objectives. This suggests a stance towards easing, as the Committee is prepared to keep rates lower to support the economy, which is consistent with a dovish monetary policy approach."
2,That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC recognizes the importance of global economic conditions in shaping monetary policy but does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing policy. It reflects an awareness of the interconnectedness of economies and the need to consider international factors when making policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL weak manufacturing","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is growth in the services sector despite weak manufacturing. This suggests that the economy is not uniformly weak and that there are areas of strength, such as the services sector. In the context of monetary policy, if the services sector is a larger part of the economy, this growth could sustain overall economic activity and potentially contribute to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, especially if they are targeting a 2% inflation rate over the long term. The mention of ""weak manufacturing"" alone might be seen as dovish, but the acknowledgment of growth in services suggests a more complex economic situation where some tightening might still be warranted to balance the risks and maintain stable prices."
2,"That ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of the seminal work by Feldstein and Horioka a quarter century ago.4 Without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade, noted earlier, the United States would not have been able to finance its recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would have been smaller.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the historical relationship between domestic saving and investment, referencing the work by Feldstein and Horioka, and the impact of a decrease in home bias on the United States' ability to finance its current account deficits. This statement is more of an economic observation rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides context on international capital flows and their effects on the U.S. economy."
0,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of financial conditions as being supportive of growth and employment, which indicates a balanced view of the economic situation. The mention of a slightly lower expected path for the federal funds rate in the long run, along with modest movements in Treasury yields, rising equity prices, narrowing corporate bond spreads, and a stable dollar, suggests that the financial environment is neither exerting strong pressure for tightening nor signaling a need for easing. The overall tone is one of observing stable conditions that do not warrant a change in policy stance, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
1,"Total nonfarm payroll employment increased at a solid pace in October and November, and the unemployment rate declined, reaching 4.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a solid increase in employment and a decline in the unemployment rate, which suggests that the labor market is strengthening. A stronger labor market typically leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could indicate a move towards higher interest rates or other contractionary measures to maintain price stability."
2,"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable,"" indicates that there has been no significant change in the expectations for inflation in the long term. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively anchoring inflation expectations, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of price stability. The statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as stable expectations are consistent with the FOMC's target. Therefore, the stance is neutral, reflecting neither a clear intent to adjust policy in a more restrictive (hawkish) nor an accommodative (dovish) direction."
0,"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic rationale for the development of cities, focusing on the concept of labor market pooling and its impact on productivity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it discusses a structural aspect of the economy that could influence productivity and economic growth, which are factors the FOMC might consider in its broader assessment of economic conditions. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action regarding the adjustment of the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"In fact, applying a formal regression analysis to the full sample from 1989 to 2002, we found a number fairly close to this one, namely, a stock price multiplier for monetary policy of about 4.7.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the results of a formal regression analysis, indicating a specific multiplier effect of monetary policy on stock prices. It does not directly suggest an immediate action or stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a quantitative measure of the impact of monetary policy on the stock market, which could be used to inform policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC should raise or lower interest rates or adjust its policy tools, thus it is best classified as neutral."
1,"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between inflation expectations and actual inflation, suggesting that if expected inflation increases only slightly, actual inflation will also increase marginally. This statement does not directly indicate a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains a dynamic that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. It reflects an understanding of how expectations can influence economic outcomes, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of being informed by a range of indicators and balancing risks when making decisions."
2,"Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that real yields (interest rates adjusted for inflation) have increased more than nominal yields (interest rates not adjusted for inflation), and inflation expectations (as implied by the market for Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) have declined. This suggests that the market anticipates a tighter monetary policy stance to combat potential inflation, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. The increase in real yields could be a result of the FOMC's actions to raise interest rates to ensure price stability, one of its key goals."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a wait-and-see approach, emphasizing the importance of incoming economic data before deciding on any changes to the monetary policy stance. This suggests a balanced view that does not inherently lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a willingness to adjust policy in response to new information. It reflects a commitment to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear move in either direction."
0,"The underlying rate of consumer price inflation in recent months was lower than the staff expected at the time of the November meeting, and the staff forecast anticipated that core PCE prices would rise a bit more slowly in 2011 and 2012 than previously projected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the actual inflation rate was lower than expected and that the forecast suggests a slower rise in core PCE prices, which implies that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat higher inflation. This could lead to a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, in line with the FOMC's objectives of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,"Participants thought that consumer expenditures likely would expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters, supported by solid gains in employment and real income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of steady economic growth, with consumer spending expected to increase due to improvements in employment and real income. This outlook suggests a balanced view of the economy, neither indicating a need to tighten monetary policy to cool down an overheating economy (hawkish) nor suggesting a need to stimulate the economy due to weakness (dovish). It reflects a belief that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling any immediate shifts in monetary policy."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad goals that guide the Committee's actions."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where stock prices have risen due to positive earnings reports and signs of economic stabilization. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather reports on market conditions and investor sentiment. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather reflects a balanced view of the current economic situation."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a positive trend in the unemployment rate but also suggests that this indicator alone may not fully capture the state of the labor market due to the decline in labor force participation. This indicates a balanced view that neither clearly suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of labor market conditions, which is one aspect of the FOMC's mandate, without providing a direct policy action or inclination."
2,Consider our estimates of real economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Consider our estimates of real economic activity"" does not provide any specific direction on monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that suggests the FOMC is taking into account current economic conditions, which is a standard part of their decision-making process. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,Some participants noted that additional asset purchases could be used to provide more accommodation by lowering longer-term interest rates.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants are considering the use of additional asset purchases to lower longer-term interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy easing. This action would be taken to provide more economic accommodation, typically in response to concerns about weak economic growth or below-target inflation, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s when the models did not accurately predict actual money growth. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of monetary policy implementation and the limitations of economic models, which is a neutral context in terms of policy direction."
2,"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants expect inflation to increase as the economy uses up excess capacity (resource slack diminishes) and inflation expectations stay stable. This expectation of rising inflation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from overshooting the Committee's long-term target of 2%. The anticipation of a gradual rise in inflation as the economy approaches full employment aligns with a hawkish stance, where the FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of understanding the economic situation to achieve the dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. This reflects a balanced approach, focusing on the assessment of economic conditions to inform future policy decisions."
2,"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes characteristics of certain exchange rate regimes, specifically a currency board and dollarization, in comparison to a fixed exchange rate system. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or suggest any imminent actions to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of the structural aspects of these systems and their relative inflexibility or costliness to exit, which is a general economic observation rather than a policy direction."
2,"With energy prices having turned down, overall consumer price inflation had eased slightly in recent months,","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that overall consumer price inflation has decreased due to falling energy prices. This suggests that inflationary pressures are lessening, which could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. A dovish stance is typically associated with a focus on stimulating the economy and is less concerned with fighting inflation, especially when inflation appears to be moderating."
0,"Policymakers, economists, and market participants see much of this decline as reflecting a permanent fall in the equilibrium rate of interestâ€”that is, the level of the federal funds rate that keeps the economy at full employment with stable inflation in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a perceived change in the equilibrium rate of interest, which is the federal funds rate level that would sustain full employment and stable inflation over the long term. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic conditions and how they might affect the neutral rate of interest. This understanding could influence future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific direction of policy change."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expansion in monetary aggregates due to increased demand for currency and inflows to retail money market funds, which is happening during a period of weakness in the U.S. bond and equity markets. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the economic conditions and the behavior of financial markets without suggesting a specific policy response. The FOMC might consider these conditions when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a change in the stance of monetary policy."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the FOMC views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower, indicating a stance that is neither particularly inclined towards tightening nor easing monetary policy. This balanced view implies that the Committee does not see a clear need to adjust policy in either direction to achieve their inflation goal at the moment."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting improvements in the labor market and moderate economic activity, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view that aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a clear move towards either tightening or easing policy."
2,"Broad equity price indexes were higher over the intermeeting period, amid heightened volatility.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding equity prices and volatility without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reports on financial market conditions. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy adjustment."
1,"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of addressing projected growth in entitlement spending on expectations of stability, which is more related to fiscal policy rather than the direct monetary policy actions typically undertaken by the FOMC. While fiscal policy can influence economic conditions that the FOMC must respond to, the sentence itself does not indicate a clear stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more focused on the long-term fiscal outlook and its effects on economic expectations."
0,where unemployment continues to fall at a gradual pace as it has been since last September—and we have made some progress since last September,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where unemployment is falling gradually, which is a positive economic indicator, but it does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states an observation of the labor market's progress without indicating a change in policy stance. The mention of progress since last September indicates an ongoing trend rather than a new development that would warrant a shift in policy."
0,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that even when traditional monetary policy tools, like adjusting short-term interest rates, are no longer viable (e.g., when rates hit the zero lower bound), the central bank still has other measures it can take to provide economic stimulus. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further if necessary, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite an increase in the required amount of tightening, the FOMC members do not see the need for an accelerated pace of policy tightening. This is because they believe there is still some economic slack, productivity growth is likely to keep unit labor costs and prices in check, and inflation is expected to remain contained. The mention of economic slack and contained inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy aggressively, which would be more characteristic of a hawkish stance. The focus on maintaining stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates without an immediate need to tighten policy suggests a preference for a more accommodative approach to support maximum employment."
2,"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's actions in terms of enhancing their communication and transparency regarding future monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the procedural aspect of how the Committee conveys its policy intentions and decision-making process to the public. The mention of ""upgraded our forward guidance"" and ""unprecedented information about our policy reaction function"" suggests an emphasis on clarity and predictability, which are neutral in terms of policy direction."
2,"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the use of consensus estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and potential growth to understand the economy's initial conditions and prospects, which is a neutral statement in terms of monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an analytical approach to assessing economic conditions. The reference to ""what type of landing we should be aiming for"" suggests a focus on managing the economy towards a desired state, but without specifying whether this involves tightening or easing policy, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
0,"In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of a price-level-targeting scheme, specifically how it behaves in the presence of deflation and a rising price-level target. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation on the mechanics of a particular monetary policy framework and its implications for the price-level gap over time."
1,"However, investor demand for high-quality commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) reportedly was robust, although issuance of CMBS remained muted.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of investor demand and issuance levels for commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor for easing (which would be dovish). Instead, it provides an observation on market conditions, which is part of the economic landscape the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is purely procedural, describing a break in the meeting followed by a staff presentation on policy alternatives. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy or signal a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that there will be a discussion on the options available for setting monetary policy, without any hint of what those options might entail or the Committee's inclination towards any particular action."
2,these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies a concern that hiring may not be robust enough to quickly reduce unemployment to its normal rate. This cautious view on employment suggests that the FOMC might favor a more accommodative policy stance to stimulate the economy and support job growth, rather than tightening monetary policy."
2,"also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses term premiums as compensation for risks, including the risk of future inflation, when extending credit far into the future. This statement is a general observation about market behavior and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges the existence of risks associated with long-term lending, which is a neutral concept in the context of monetary policy stances."
1,"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the speaker does not believe that a moderate increase in the federal funds rate would significantly impact investor optimism regarding emerging technologies. This indicates a view that monetary policy adjustments of 50 to 100 basis points would not have a strong influence on this particular aspect of the economy. The stance is neither explicitly in favor of tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but rather expresses a belief in the limited effect of such changes on long-run earnings growth expectations. It reflects a neutral position on the effectiveness of monetary policy in this context."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an external event (the outbreak) on economic activity and financial markets without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges disturbances but does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing measures. The focus is on the observation of conditions rather than a policy stance."
1,Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate"" does not explicitly indicate a change in the pace of inflation or a shift in monetary policy. It simply states that the rate of increase in consumer prices remained consistent with the previous quarter. This suggests that the FOMC might not see an immediate need to adjust its policy stance if the inflation rate is stable and in line with their long-term target. The sentence does not provide information on whether the current rate is above, below, or at the desired 2% inflation target, nor does it indicate a direction for future policy moves. Therefore, it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
2,and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the results of the FOMC's approach are similar to those of central banks that use flexible inflation targeting, but it does not explicitly indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It implies that the FOMC's methods are comparable to other central banks in terms of effectiveness without suggesting a shift in policy stance."
2,"Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse disruptions, or ""shocks.""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general role of monetary policy in responding to economic disturbances without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects the FOMC's commitment to stabilizing the economy, which is consistent with its long-term goals, but does not provide information on immediate policy actions or stances."
1,"In discussing the increases in U. S. longer-term interest rates that occurred in the wake of the June FOMC meeting and the associated press conference, meeting participants pointed to heightened financial market uncertainty about the path of monetary policy and a shift of market expectations toward less policy accommodation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that financial markets are expecting a decrease in monetary policy accommodation, which typically means an anticipation of higher interest rates or a tightening of monetary policy. This expectation could be due to the FOMC signaling a more aggressive stance on controlling inflation or other economic factors that warrant reduced stimulus. The reference to ""less policy accommodation"" suggests a move towards a tighter monetary policy, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the prices of exports and the balance of trade, which is influenced by foreign exchange markets. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an observation on international trade dynamics, which could be a factor the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. However, without a clear link to policy actions aimed at adjusting employment, inflation, or interest rates, the sentence itself remains neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a scenario where inflation expectations are successfully lowered and stabilized, allowing the FOMC to adjust real interest rates in response to demand shocks. This suggests a proactive stance in managing inflation and indicates a willingness to tighten monetary policy (increase real rates) when demand increases, which is characteristic of a hawkish policy stance. The focus on controlling inflation and the mention of pro-cyclical adjustments to real rates in response to demand shocks align with a tightening bias to prevent overheating of the economy."
1,Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the majority of the participants support continued increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. Raising interest rates is a tool used to tighten monetary policy, which is typically done to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. The use of ""further gradual increases"" suggests a cautious approach to tightening, but it is still indicative of a hawkish stance, as the intent is to move towards higher interest rates to sustain the Committee's objectives, which include maintaining price stability."
2,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation with conflicting economic signals: strong private domestic demand on one side and negative external influences from the Asian crisis on the other. This indicates a balanced view of the economy, with both positive and negative factors at play, which does not clearly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might be weighing these factors against each other to determine the appropriate policy stance, but the sentence itself does not indicate a clear direction towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Advances in productivity had boosted profit margins, and high margins were helpful in that they could absorb some portion of any cost increases for a time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where increases in productivity have led to higher profit margins, which could help companies absorb cost increases temporarily. This statement does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation on how productivity gains can impact the economy, which could be seen as a factor that might influence monetary policy decisions, but it does not commit to any particular action. It reflects an understanding of economic conditions without suggesting a need to adjust monetary policy immediately."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members anticipate that an increase in employment could lead to slower productivity growth, resulting in higher unit labor costs and potential upward pressure on prices. This scenario implies a risk of inflation, which could necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
0,"Well, we—as a Committee, we do not desire inflation undershoots.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is averse to inflation falling below their target, which suggests they would be inclined to take action to prevent such undershoots. This could imply a readiness to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation at or above their desired level, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the actions of emerging-market economies in the foreign exchange market, specifically their interventions to prevent currency appreciation by purchasing dollars. This statement does not directly indicate the Federal Reserve's stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more of an observation of international economic behavior rather than a comment on domestic monetary policy goals such as employment, price stability, or interest rates."
2,The staff viewed the uncertainty around the forecast for economic activity as similar to its normal level over the past 20 years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's perception of economic activity uncertainty is consistent with historical norms, suggesting neither a particular concern nor complacency about economic conditions. This implies a balanced view without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion among FOMC members about the uncertain relationship between the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation, as well as uncertainty regarding future productivity. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The members are acknowledging uncertainties in the economic outlook, which is a neutral stance as it does not commit to a specific direction of policy action."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the current account deficit is growing due to increased investment and productivity in the U.S., attracting capital inflows because of higher rates of return. This statement is primarily an observation of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy but rather provides context on economic developments that could influence future decisions. The FOMC might consider such information when deciding on monetary policy, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular stance."
0,"Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been consistently low, even below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and instead, there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and help push inflation towards the target level."
2,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. policy rate changes in response to inflationary pressures have a significant impact on emerging market (EM) financial conditions. This suggests that when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates to combat inflation (a tightening of monetary policy), it has a notable effect on international markets, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy to address inflationary concerns is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
0,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a situation where business sentiment is negative, growth in sales and profits is disappointing, and there is an excess of capital and idle capacity. These conditions suggest economic weakness, which would typically lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment, as there is no immediate concern for inflationary pressures due to excess capacity."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market movements in Treasury yields without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. The fall in nominal Treasury yields and the rise in yields on inflation-indexed securities, leading to lower inflation compensation, could be interpreted in various ways. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is moving towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects market reactions to various factors, which could be influenced by economic data, investor sentiment, or other non-monetary policy factors."
2,participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""participants generally expected no more than moderate growth in consumer spending over the near term"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a steady, moderate pace of economic activity, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The expectation of moderate growth does not by itself signal a need to adjust policy to counteract inflation or to stimulate the economy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, the gap between actual and potential output was anticipated to diminish only slowly unless aggregate demand expanded much more rapidly than the members currently foresaw.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members expect the gap between actual and potential output to close slowly unless there is a significant increase in aggregate demand, which they do not currently anticipate. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, as the statement does not explicitly signal an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear direction for future policy moves, hence it is considered neutral."
1,"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is continuing to rise to levels not seen in 40 years, which is well above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation and bring it back down to their target level, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market participants' reactions to a report and the subsequent effect on Treasury yields, rather than directly stating the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence merely reflects the market's interpretation of the report's implications for future monetary policy actions."
1,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strategy focused on reducing inflation, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation down. Describing the economy as being ""one recession from price stability"" indicates a willingness to accept the economic slowdown (or even a recession) as a trade-off for achieving price stability, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance. This approach aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and in the context of high inflation, it would likely involve measures to cool down the economy, such as raising interest rates."
2,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve stable prices and support sustainable economic growth, which are among its core objectives. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes the overall goals of the Committee. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish stance (tightening policy) or a dovish stance (easing policy), hence it is classified as neutral."
1,We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a commitment to keeping inflation low, which often involves tightening monetary policy to prevent prices from rising too quickly. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down economic growth or credit expansion."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are labor shortages in several districts, which can lead to upward pressure on wages as businesses compete for qualified workers. Higher wages can contribute to inflationary pressures, which may prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. This aligns with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and could suggest a need for a more hawkish stance to achieve their inflation target."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand. This action aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target rate is typically considered a hawkish stance."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the preferences of investors or savers towards more liquid and safe assets, which does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects observations on market behavior rather than a commitment to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC might consider such information when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy action."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a commitment to monitoring developments that could impact the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a stance of vigilance and readiness to act as necessary to maintain their goals. This suggests a balanced approach, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the profession's emphasis on it, as well as the current central tendency of NAIRU estimates and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth. This statement is primarily descriptive, explaining the considerations and tools used by economists to gauge the economy's performance relative to inflation and unemployment. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy, but rather provides context on economic indicators that inform policy decisions."
0,"A few members expressed interest in using language specifying a period of time during which the federal funds rate was expected to remain exceptionally low, rather than a calendar date, arguing that such language might be better to indicate a constant stance of monetary policy over time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are considering the use of language that would signal an extended period of low federal funds rates. This suggests a preference for an easing monetary policy stance to support economic activity, which is typically associated with a dovish outlook. By emphasizing a ""constant stance of monetary policy over time,"" these members are leaning towards ensuring accommodative conditions to foster maximum employment and stable prices, in line with the FOMC's dovish goals of stimulating the economy when necessary."
1,"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate to achieve price stability and full employment, which are its core objectives. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change, such as tightening or easing, but rather states the overall goals of the FOMC. The sentence reflects a balanced approach to monetary policy, aiming to fulfill the dual mandate without suggesting any immediate action or change in policy stance."
0,A number of participants stressed that recently enacted fiscal support would help address some of the hardships faced by these groups and that monetary policy would also help by promoting the economy's return to the Committee's goals of broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a supportive stance towards fiscal measures and suggests that monetary policy will be used to promote the economy's return to the Committee's goals, which include broad-based and inclusive maximum employment and price stability. This implies a willingness to maintain or introduce policies that encourage economic growth and support employment, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. The focus on addressing hardships and promoting inclusive employment suggests that the Committee is not inclined to tighten monetary policy at this time, as doing so could hinder these objectives."
2,"Although some members noted that a case could be made that the risks to inflation were now somewhat skewed to the upside and those to sustainable economic growth perhaps to the downside, the most likely outcome remained one of stable prices and sustainable growth, and the Committee agreed that it should retain a balanced assessment of risks conditional on appropriate policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is recognition of potential risks to inflation and economic growth, the consensus within the Committee is that the most probable scenario is one of stable prices and sustainable growth, provided that the policy remains appropriate. This suggests a balanced view, with no clear inclination towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather a commitment to adjusting policy as needed to maintain stability and growth. The mention of retaining a ""balanced assessment of risks"" further reinforces the neutral stance."
1,"But the importance of price stability has sometimes been insufficiently appreciated in our central bank's history, and, as Allan Meltzer will soon point out, such episodes have had unfortunate consequences.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the significance of price stability and implies that neglecting this aspect has led to negative outcomes in the past. This suggests a stance that would favor measures to prevent inflation, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability."
0,U. S. real GDP was forecast to plummet and the unemployment rate to soar in the second quarter of this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic forecast and does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy. It simply provides an outlook on economic conditions, specifically regarding GDP and unemployment, without suggesting a tightening or easing of policy. The FOMC might use such data to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction of policy change."
2,"In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations are responsive to new information and the communication from the FOMC, but it does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation about market reactions without providing a clear direction on future policy actions."
1,They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering the impact of higher energy prices on household income and spending, which is a factor in their assessment of economic conditions. This does not directly suggest a move to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows that they are monitoring economic indicators that could influence future decisions. It reflects a balanced approach to understanding the economic environment without a clear indication of a policy shift."
1,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where, despite slow overall economic growth and disappointing productivity, the labor market is still generating a significant number of jobs each month. This indicates a mixed economic situation where there are both positive and negative aspects, which does not clearly suggest a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The job creation figures are relatively healthy and could be seen as supporting the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but the slow growth and poor productivity could be concerns that counterbalance this positive aspect. Therefore, the stance is neutral, as the sentence does not lean towards a clear need for a change in policy direction."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement reflecting on the Federal Reserve's past success in achieving a key aspect of its mandate—price stability—by reducing inflation to the target rate over a period of time. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy actions regarding tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides context about the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation goals and its past effectiveness in reaching those goals."
1,"Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation pressures might increase significantly if the economy grows too quickly, potentially due to fiscal stimulus or easy financial conditions. This suggests that the FOMC might consider a more aggressive series of interest rate hikes to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants expect to continue increasing the federal funds rate gradually. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, which is typically described as hawkish. The expectation is that such increases would support ongoing economic expansion and strong labor market conditions, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The use of ""further gradual increases"" suggests a deliberate approach to raising rates to prevent overheating of the economy, which is a common concern when the economy is performing well."
2,"As you can see, transforming the information available from published statistics into concepts useful for assessing the consequences of monetary policy is, in fact, quite complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the complexity of interpreting economic data for policy assessment, which is a general statement about the challenges faced in monetary policy decision-making. It does not provide information on the direction of policy changes or the Committee's view on economic conditions relative to their objectives of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism by which monetary policy influences the economy and acknowledges the role of financial markets in reflecting expectations about policy, economic activity, and inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the transmission of policy effects and the importance of market signals. This statement is more about the process and the information used for decision-making rather than a clear direction of policy change."
2,"Largely as a consequence of rapidly expanding ""new economy"" investments, gains in productivity had occurred at remarkable rates in recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where investments in the ""new economy"" have led to significant gains in productivity. This statement is factual and does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a positive economic development, which could potentially lead to higher employment and stable prices, aligning with the FOMC's goals. However, without additional context on how this productivity gain affects inflation or employment, it's not clear whether this would lead to a hawkish or dovish policy response. Therefore, the stance is neutral."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The mention of underutilization implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support the labor market and help achieve full employment without the risk of triggering high inflation. This dovish stance would typically not support tightening monetary policy."
2,"Instead, an upturn in foreign economic activity would depend more on recovery in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states an observation regarding the relationship between foreign economic activity and the United States' economic recovery, without suggesting any specific monetary policy actions or implications for inflation or employment targets."
2,continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""continued to anticipate a moderate strengthening of the expansion in 2011 as well as a further pickup in economic growth in 2012"" indicates an expectation of economic growth but does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced outlook on the economy's trajectory, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"A more robust contour for final sales over the forecast horizon would lead to somewhat greater pressure on resource margins, despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity, though the level of activity would remain below the economy's potential for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there is an expectation of increased pressure on resource margins due to stronger final sales, which could lead to higher inflationary pressures. Despite the acknowledgment of strong structural productivity growth and activity remaining below the economy's potential, the focus on greater pressure on resources suggests a concern for inflation, which is typically addressed by a tightening of monetary policy. This aligns with a hawkish stance, where the FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes what multifactor productivity encompasses without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply defines a concept related to economic output and efficiency, which does not directly suggest an imminent change in policy stance towards either tightening or easing."
2,But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the resilience of exchange rates that are supported by compatible policies and cost structures, without directly indicating a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor provides insight into the FOMC's future monetary policy decisions. Instead, it reflects a general observation about the stability of exchange rates in the face of speculation, which is not directly related to the immediate goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is operating at or near full employment, which is one of the Federal Reserve's goals. When the economy is at full employment, the concern often shifts towards preventing overheating and controlling inflation. Therefore, the statement may imply a need for a tighter monetary policy to ensure that the economy does not exceed its productive capacity, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This aligns with a hawkish stance, where the FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
2,The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged"" does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC's view on inflation has not shifted, implying that their current policy stance is likely to remain the same as it was before this assessment. This reflects a balanced approach consistent with their goals of stable prices and does not signal a move to adjust the policy in response to changes in inflation expectations."
1,The members agreed that the statement to be issued after this meeting should highlight their view that even after their firming today the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflation pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about the potential for rising inflation pressures, even after a decision to tighten monetary policy (""firming today""). This suggests that they are prepared to continue tightening policy if necessary to counteract inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or controlling higher inflation."
1,"Measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) edged up, on net, remaining close to their pre-pandemic levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where inflation expectations, as measured by the market for TIPS, have increased slightly but are still aligned with levels seen before the pandemic. This observation does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, as it indicates neither a significant increase in inflation expectations that would warrant a tightening (hawkish stance) nor a decrease that might suggest the need for easing (dovish stance). It simply provides an assessment of market-based inflation expectations, which is one of many indicators the FOMC considers when evaluating the stance of monetary policy."
0,The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of reduced pressures on resources and a moderation in core price inflation due to a period of slower economic expansion. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth and employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
2,"I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and, hopefully, explain why the value of education, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the importance of education and advanced skills for economic growth, which is a broader economic issue rather than a specific monetary policy action. It reflects on long-term economic health and productivity rather than immediate monetary policy adjustments."
0,and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent"" indicates that inflation is moving toward the Federal Reserve's target rate but does not explicitly suggest immediate action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a scenario where the current policy stance is leading to a gradual increase in inflation towards the desired level, which is consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is merely referencing a descriptive study of inflation targets in transition economies by Mishkin and Jonas and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy, nor does it directly relate to the current economic conditions or policy adjustments in the United States."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a negative impact on real income growth due to higher energy prices, this was counterbalanced by strong increases in wages and salaries. This suggests a mixed economic situation where there are both inflationary pressures (from energy prices) and signs of a healthy labor market (wage and salary growth). The statement does not clearly lean towards a need for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather presents a balanced view of the economic conditions."
2,"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to,","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the banking system is currently resilient and strong, and there is no concerning increase in leverage or credit growth. This suggests that the FOMC is monitoring these factors but does not indicate an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement reflects an observation of the current financial system's stability rather than a direct indication of future policy moves. It aligns with the FOMC's goals of maintaining stable financial conditions but does not signal a change in policy stance."
2,"The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of the Federal Reserve's credibility, which has been established through a history of maintaining low inflation, and how it contributes to the effectiveness of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather underscores the value of the Fed's reputation in achieving its long-term goals. The statement reflects a general principle rather than a specific policy stance."
1,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to raise interest rates, which is a typical tool for tightening monetary policy. This action is usually taken to control inflation or prevent an overheating economy, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The speaker's comfort with raising rates despite a large balance sheet suggests a focus on controlling inflation over stimulating the economy, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market improvements had slowed but were continuing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past situation where high inflation was considered temporary and labor market improvements were ongoing, albeit at a slower pace. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an observation of economic conditions at a specific point in time. The mention of ""high inflation being temporary"" could be seen as dovish, as it implies that the inflationary pressures might not warrant a tightening response. However, the acknowledgment of continued labor market improvements, even if slow, could be seen as a sign of economic resilience, which is a neutral observation. Overall, the sentence does not clearly advocate for a specific policy direction, hence the classification as neutral."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a factual situation regarding the U.S. current account deficit and the trade balance, specifically the numerical difference between imports and exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate actions to be taken by the Federal Reserve in terms of tightening or easing. The statement is merely providing data on the country's international financial position, without implying any particular policy direction."
2,"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there are anecdotal reports of retailers planning to reduce prices due to excess inventory, there is no aggregate data to confirm a widespread trend of businesses lowering their profit margins in response to customer price sensitivity. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, as the FOMC is not signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy based on this information alone. It reflects a balanced stance, as the Committee is acknowledging a potential factor that could influence inflation but also indicating the absence of concrete data to act upon."
0,"In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about the target inflation rate and does not directly indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that with a 2 percent inflation objective, the real terms would be 1 percent, assuming the speaker is accounting for some level of nominal growth or inflation. This does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards raising rates, lowering them, or keeping them the same."
1,"The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public's expectations of inflation will also be low and stable.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle of monetary policy, stating that price stability leads to stable inflation expectations, which in turn promotes stability in output and employment. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the rationale behind aiming for price stability as part of the FOMC's mandate. The focus is on the benefits of controlling inflation for achieving the broader economic goals of the Federal Reserve, without suggesting any immediate policy action."
0,market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low"" suggests that expectations for future inflation are subdued, as reflected by financial market indicators. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity. The FOMC may interpret low inflation compensation as a sign that inflation is not a current threat to the stability of prices, one of their key goals, and therefore may not see the need to adopt a more hawkish policy stance."
1,"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of price dynamics, specifically the asymmetric response of prices to cost shocks, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a phenomenon that affects inflation but does not in itself indicate a clear direction for policy change. The FOMC might consider this information when making decisions, but the sentence alone does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumers' inflation expectations are either decreasing or are at historically low levels. This suggests that inflation pressures may be subdued, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, lower inflation expectations align with the aim of stable prices and might reduce the need for actions that would otherwise be necessary to bring down higher inflation."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation rates being persistently below the FOMC's 2% target, which could lead to lower long-term inflation expectations. The mention of ""makeup"" strategies suggests that there is a consideration for policies that would allow inflation to rise above the target for some time to compensate for previous periods of below-target inflation. This implies a potential easing of monetary policy to boost inflation to the desired level, which is a dovish stance."
2,"As a case in point, the increase in the transparency of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical change in the approach to U.S. monetary policy, specifically its transparency, and does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact about the evolution of policy communication rather than a comment on current or future policy actions."
2,"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory statement that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It simply indicates a transition in the discussion to the topic of monetary policy, without any indication of a stance towards tightening or easing."
1,"Business contacts in a number of Districts noted an improvement in housing activity and a continued rise in house prices, although their reports showed that the pace of sales and construction varied across regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of the housing market, noting improvements in activity and rising house prices, but also acknowledges variability in sales and construction across different regions. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a balanced view of the housing sector, which is one of many economic indicators the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should adjust its policy stance to address inflation or employment goals, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic environment with strong performance and credit availability that supports the creation and growth of innovative enterprises. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of the economic conditions. The statement aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as a strong economy and credit availability can contribute to these objectives. However, without a clear indication of how these conditions will affect the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is slower growth in final spending leading to inventory overhangs, which is an observation of current economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Committee's monitoring of economic indicators, which could potentially influence future policy decisions depending on how these conditions interact with the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively taking measures to control inflation and return it to their target rate of 2 percent. The mention of ""taking action"" suggests that they are likely tightening monetary policy to address higher inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The reference to last year's rapid economic growth being supported by accommodative (easier) fiscal and monetary policy, and the observation that demand has moderated as these supportive policies have abated, further implies that the current policy is less accommodative, or more hawkish, as they are not providing the same level of stimulus."
0,"Moreover, the absence of significant growth in employment, should it persist, could at some point have significant adverse repercussions on consumer spending.","DOVISH

The sentence implies concern over the lack of employment growth and its potential negative impact on consumer spending. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate employment and prevent a downturn in consumer spending, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The focus on preventing adverse effects aligns with the FOMC's goal of supporting maximum employment, one of its key mandates."
2,"Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark to a discussion about misconceptions regarding inflation targeting. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it sets the stage for clarification or educational points on the topic of inflation targeting, which is a part of the FOMC's approach to fulfilling its mandate. The sentence itself does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments."
0,"And, in particular, I do personally believe that the slowdown is at least partly temporary, and that we’ll see greater growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic slowdown is partly temporary and anticipates greater growth in the future. This implies an expectation of economic recovery without the need for immediate tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to encourage economic growth. The sentiment expressed does not indicate a concern for rising inflation that would necessitate a hawkish approach."
2,"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific direction on the future of monetary policy but rather indicates that the speaker will discuss the use of forward guidance as a tool. It sets the stage for a discussion on policy tools without revealing whether the policy stance will be more hawkish or dovish. The mention of ""near-term monetary policy"" without any context or indication of changes does not suggest a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target by potentially allowing it to run moderately above this level for some time. This suggests a willingness to tolerate higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, reflecting a hawkish stance. The focus on anchoring expectations at the 2 percent level also implies vigilance against inflation falling below the desired target, which could necessitate policy adjustments that are more aggressive in nature."
0,"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic conditions, noting strong fundamentals such as low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, which are expected to support future expenditures on software and equipment. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic environment. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather implies a stable backdrop against which current policy can operate."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an opinion held by a group of economists regarding the relationship between monetary policy and financial market bubbles, rather than indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it is considered a neutral stance in the context of classifying monetary policy direction."
0,"In response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures, central banks around the world eased policy sharply.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that central banks, in reaction to a slowdown in economic activity and a decrease in inflationary pressures, have taken measures to ease policy significantly. This easing of policy typically involves lowering interest rates or implementing other measures to stimulate economic growth, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports looser monetary conditions to encourage employment and economic activity, especially when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,"The members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early February.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are prepared to take action to address concerns about rising inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on controlling inflation, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the producer price index for core intermediate materials is declining, which indicates a reduction in inflationary pressures at the production level. However, the fact that this decline is happening at a slower pace than before does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply provides an observation on the current economic conditions related to inflation, without a clear directional implication for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might interpret this data in the context of other economic indicators to decide on a policy stance that continues to aim for stable prices, one of its main goals."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for clear signs of achieving employment and inflation objectives before raising interest rates (liftoff), combined with a tool to manage the yield curve (yield curve caps). This approach indicates a balanced stance, as it suggests neither an immediate tightening nor an easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a conditional and strategic approach to policy adjustments based on the achievement of specific economic goals, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates in the context of economic theory, productivity growth, and demographic projections. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of underlying economic conditions that could influence the long-term stance of monetary policy. The focus on trend growth and demographic projections indicates a consideration of long-term factors that affect the economy's potential output, which is relevant for setting policy but does not in itself indicate a change in the current policy stance."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The speaker is emphasizing the focus on these two core objectives when setting interest rates, which does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions. It is a statement of policy approach rather than a signal of imminent policy change."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past event where expectations of the Federal Reserve reducing its asset purchases (tapering) resulted in higher interest rates and increased market volatility, leading to sharp declines in emerging market economies (EMEs) exchange rates and asset prices. This statement is more of an observation of market reactions to anticipated policy changes rather than an indication of the current or future stance of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects on the consequences of market expectations."
2,"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1/2 to 2 percentage points.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of trade with developing economies on the growth rate of import prices in industrialized countries, providing an analysis of the situation rather than indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather offers information on one of the factors that could influence inflation rates. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy action."
2,"Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmet needs to produce shortages.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the efficiency of businesses in adjusting to price changes, which helps to prevent excess inventory accumulation or shortages. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather comments on the market's ability to self-regulate in response to price signals. This observation is more about the functioning of the economy and the market's adaptability rather than a direct comment on the need for changes in monetary policy."
0,The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states an observation about economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in growth across various sectors of expenditure. This could be interpreted as a potential concern for both employment and inflation, but without additional context on the FOMC's response or interpretation, the stance remains neutral."
2,"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that price-level targeting might necessitate a higher short-term inflation rate than what is aimed for in the long term, suggesting a potential need for a tighter monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is generally associated with increasing interest rates or taking other measures to cool down inflationary pressures to achieve stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Moving to such a system would require assigning monetary policy to the task of targeting exchange rates, and countries are free to do so if they wish.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a hypothetical scenario regarding monetary policy's focus on targeting exchange rates, without indicating a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that countries have the option to target exchange rates if they choose, which does not directly relate to the current goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustment."
1,"For a variety of reasons, oil prices already had risen appreciably since the start of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about oil prices rising without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy in response to this change in oil prices. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine how this price change might affect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Broaddus believes a tightening of monetary policy (which usually means increasing interest rates) is necessary due to strong aggregate demand. Tightening policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check."
2,"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between consumer spending and changes in home values, particularly in the context of sophisticated mortgage markets like those in the United States. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on economic behavior that could be relevant to the FOMC's decision-making process. The sentence suggests that changes in home equity could have a more significant impact on consumer spending than in the past, which is an important factor for the FOMC to consider when assessing economic conditions and setting policy, but it does not in itself advocate for a particular policy direction."
0,the anticipated decline in the unemployment rate was somewhat slower than in the previous projection.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""the anticipated decline in the unemployment rate was somewhat slower than in the previous projection"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation about the pace of improvement in the labor market relative to previous expectations. This could be interpreted in various ways depending on the broader economic context. If the economy is overheating, a slower decline in unemployment might be seen as positive, reducing the need for hawkish measures. Conversely, if the economy is weak, the statement might suggest a dovish tilt is needed to support the labor market. However, without additional context, the statement itself is neutral, as it does not explicitly suggest a policy action."
0,"What modern monetary policymaking has not faced for quite some time, if ever, has been a major surge in innovation--matching, if not exceeding, the other great waves this century--followed by an apparent elevation of productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there has been a significant increase in innovation and a subsequent rise in productivity growth. This observation does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an economic development that could potentially impact the FOMC's decision-making. Increased productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflation, which might allow the FOMC to maintain its current policy stance. However, without additional context on how this productivity growth affects employment and price stability, the sentence itself does not suggest a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand"" suggests that there is an imbalance in the economy that could be causing inflationary pressures (if demand exceeds supply) or deflationary pressures (if supply exceeds demand). Given the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and a 2% inflation target, a misalignment that leads to inflation would likely prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to reduce demand and bring the economy back into balance. Therefore, without additional context indicating which side of the balance is affected, the statement leans towards a hawkish interpretation, as it implies a potential need for action to correct the misalignment to achieve price stability."
2,"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a willingness to adjust interest rates rapidly in response to changing economic conditions. This implies a proactive stance on monetary policy, which could mean tightening (increasing rates) if economic conditions such as inflation warrant it, in line with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The readiness to change rates ""quite quickly"" indicates a bias towards action, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance when aimed at preventing or curbing high inflation or other imbalances."
1,"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of achieving price stability to ensure that inflation does not erode wages and to facilitate a long economic expansion. This focus on curbing inflation suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down to the target level, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates to manage inflation, which is consistent with the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The reference to getting ""back to price stability"" implies that current conditions are not at the desired level of price stability, indicating a potential need for policy action to address inflationary pressures."
2,"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate during the 1988-90 period, stating that they were not especially surprising or anomalous. This statement does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply reflects a retrospective assessment of economic conditions without suggesting any immediate policy action. It is a neutral observation that does not inherently signal a change in the stance of monetary policy."
2,"In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that adjustments to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet are being considered as a tool to influence longer-term interest rates and to complement the communication of policy intentions related to the short-term interest rate. This suggests a proactive approach to managing monetary policy, which typically involves tightening when the balance sheet is reduced. Using the balance sheet to affect interest rates is often associated with a more hawkish stance, as it indicates a willingness to influence borrowing costs and potentially slow down economic activity to achieve the FOMC's goals, particularly if inflation is above the target."
1,"But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is aiming to maintain the current economic expansion and stay aligned with its statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a commitment to monitoring and adjusting as necessary to maintain these objectives. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the dual mandate without indicating a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential downside risks to economic growth and acknowledges the limited capacity of the economy to absorb negative shocks, given that the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound. This suggests a stance that is inclined towards easing monetary policy to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach. The FOMC may be considering measures to stimulate growth and employment, consistent with its mandate, in the face of these risks."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses factors that influence the public's ability to respond to inflation and their understanding of its costs, rather than directly indicating a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects on historical and structural economic changes rather than the FOMC's immediate policy intentions."
0,"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the disinflationary effect of productivity growth is expected to diminish, which could lead to higher inflation unless productivity increases further. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract potential inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on preventing inflation from rising above the target level."
1,"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that with the economy nearing full employment, there is an increased likelihood of stronger inflation outcomes due to potential fiscal stimulus. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to control inflation, consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a viewpoint on the state of employment but does not directly relate to actions the FOMC might take. It could be interpreted as either a concern that the economy is not generating enough jobs (which might be dovish if it leads to policy easing) or a suggestion that the situation is not as bad as expected (which could be hawkish if it implies less need for stimulus). However, without a clear indication of how this view would affect policy decisions, the stance is best classified as neutral."
2,"With crude oil prices expected to gradually decline from their current levels, the boost to retail food prices from the drought anticipated to be only temporary and comparatively small, long-run inflation expectations assumed to remain stable, and substantial resource slack persisting over the projection period, the staff continued to forecast that inflation would be subdued through 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of declining crude oil prices, a temporary and small impact on food prices from a drought, stable long-run inflation expectations, and persistent substantial resource slack. These factors contribute to a forecast of subdued inflation, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat rising prices. The stance is therefore dovish, as it implies that the FOMC may not need to raise interest rates or take other actions to cool down the economy, given the lack of inflationary pressures."
0,"Now, we have—you know, we haven’t anticipated that slowdown in productivity, and that’s one of the main reasons why we haven’t anticipated the relatively slow growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects an observation about economic conditions, specifically mentioning a slowdown in productivity and its impact on growth, without directly suggesting a future course of action regarding monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather explains a factor that has contributed to slower growth, which is a consideration in their policy decisions."
0,"The producer price index for core intermediate materials dropped for a fifth month in February, reflecting, in part, weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such as chemicals and plastics.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a decline in the producer price index for core intermediate materials, which suggests a reduction in inflationary pressures, particularly due to weaker global demand and lower prices of energy-intensive goods. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as inflation seems to be contained or even decreasing, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate economic activity."
1,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if a certain condition persists, it will facilitate the process of restoring price stability, which is one of the FOMC's key goals. Restoring price stability often involves controlling inflation, which can mean tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Therefore, the sentence suggests a stance that is more inclined towards taking action to ensure inflation is kept in check, which is considered hawkish."
1,"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation expectations becoming entrenched, which can lead to a self-sustaining cycle of rising wages and prices. This scenario suggests that the FOMC might lean towards tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming unanchored, aligning with a hawkish stance to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
1,"The vote also encompassed approval of the sentence below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives a greater risk of increased inflation in the near future. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
2,"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes different modeling approaches to economic analysis without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather discusses the methodology of linking economic factors to models, which could be used in various policy contexts."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while core inflation rates are currently below the FOMC's 2% target, there is an expectation that inflation will stabilize around the target level due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests a balance between concerns about current inflation levels and confidence in future inflation dynamics, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The Committee appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
0,"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of past currency movements and their correlation with trade balances, rather than indicating a future policy direction. It notes the impact of diverging interest rates on the dollar's value and the subsequent effect on exports and import prices, but does not suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is more of an economic analysis rather than a clear signal of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
0,This action was taken against the backdrop of heightened concerns and uncertainty created by the recent terrorist attacks and their potentially adverse effects on asset prices and the performance of the economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of past currency movements and their correlation with trade balances, rather than indicating a future policy direction. It notes the impact of diverging interest rates on the dollar's value and the subsequent effect on exports and import prices, but does not suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is more of an economic analysis rather than a clear signal of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
1,"It was possible, though, that investors' uncertainty regarding inflation prospects, not just inflation expectations themselves, had risen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the uncertainty in inflation prospects, which does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of market sentiment and the complexity of interpreting inflation signals, which is a neutral stance in terms of policy direction. The FOMC is acknowledging the uncertainty without committing to a particular course of action, thus maintaining a balanced approach."
0,"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an alignment of policy guidance with a new framework and a change in language from ""deviations"" to ""shortfalls"" regarding employment. This does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a methodological update in how the FOMC communicates and assesses its employment goal. The focus on ""shortfalls"" suggests a commitment to addressing unemployment more aggressively, but without specific policy actions mentioned, the stance remains neutral."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like"" does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions. It is a reflective statement that does not provide information on whether the speaker believes policy should be tightened or eased. It does not comment on current economic conditions, inflation trends, or employment levels in relation to the FOMC's goals."
1,"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise due to the end or reversal of temporary factors that were keeping prices low. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low,","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation had remained low, which suggests that inflation expectations are subdued. This could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, as the market does not anticipate a significant rise in inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this would align with a dovish stance, as it suggests that there may be room for maintaining or easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
2,The Role of Government Policy You will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it refers to the role of government policy in influencing productivity growth, which is a factor that can affect the economy but is separate from the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve. The sentence neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment nor provides insight into the Committee's future actions regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary tools."
2,how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It is a question that reflects uncertainty or consideration about the potential impact of an unspecified factor on inflation. Without context, it does not suggest whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral. It shows that the Committee is monitoring economic indicators and considering their implications for inflation, which is consistent with their mandate to maintain stable prices."
0,Participants expected economic activity to contract sharply in the fourth quarter of 2008 and in early 2009.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' expectations regarding economic activity, predicting a sharp contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008 and early 2009. It does not directly indicate a future policy action such as tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of economic conditions, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy stance. The FOMC might use such information to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not commit to any particular direction of policy change."
1,"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation is significantly above the target level, and it emphasizes the importance of returning to the target to achieve the FOMC's goals of price stability and maximum employment. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy often involves raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity and cool down an overheating economy, which in this case is experiencing high inflation."
2,"Several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes specific economic challenges in the agricultural sector, such as trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and weather-related issues. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges sector-specific difficulties that could impact the broader economy, which the FOMC might take into consideration when making policy decisions. However, without a clear indication of how these challenges would influence the FOMC's policy actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates, the stance remains neutral."
2,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff forecast predicts a natural moderation of economic expansion to align with the economy's estimated potential growth rate. This suggests a balanced view, neither indicating a need for immediate tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects an expectation that the economy is moving toward a state that is consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals of stable prices and maximum employment without explicitly suggesting a change in policy stance."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of observation regarding economic conditions abroad, which could potentially impact the U.S. economy and thus the FOMC's policy decisions. However, without additional context on how this outlook would affect the FOMC's policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, it remains a neutral statement."
2,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states a principle of economic theory that in the long run, full employment does not conflict with price stability. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not directly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply affirms the FOMC's commitment to its dual mandate without indicating a change in policy direction."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy but rather addresses a perception issue regarding the dual mandate of the Federal Reserve. It suggests that the FOMC is aware of the criticism that it may be focusing too much on inflation and not enough on employment, but it does not provide information on whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is more about the balance of their objectives and the criticism they face rather than a clear direction on policy adjustments."
1,"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the true unemployment rate may be higher than the headline figure suggests, once adjustments for labor force participation and misclassification are made. This indicates that the labor market is weaker than it appears, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. A dovish stance typically involves keeping interest rates low to stimulate economic activity, which would be appropriate in a context of high unemployment."
0,"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC expect a strong economic expansion to persist, supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary policies, positive financial conditions, and increasing productivity. This outlook suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales have slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that rents won't decline anytime in the near future.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is persistent inflationary pressure in the housing market, as indicated by dramatically growing rents and increasing prices of single-family homes. This condition implies that there may be a need for a tightening of monetary policy to address the inflationary pressures and align with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, particularly if these trends are expected to continue and not decline in the near future."
2,"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a biographical note about Palmer and her view on the inadequacy of a single unemployment figure for policy program selection. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a perspective on the complexity of labor market indicators, which is relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
2,"It was suggested that the weakening expansion of expenditures in these capital goods might reflect a surfeit in capacity following a period of extraordinary growth in many industries--for example, those related to fiber optics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is a weakening in the expansion of expenditures in capital goods, possibly due to an excess capacity in certain industries. This observation is a neutral statement regarding monetary policy as it does not directly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It is merely an assessment of economic conditions, specifically in the capital goods sector, and does not imply immediate action by the FOMC. The statement reflects an understanding of economic fluctuations and the factors that influence them, without providing a clear direction on the stance of monetary policy."
2,"Retail energy prices were likely to retrace at least a portion of the post-hurricane increase, and consumer confidence should rebound.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that certain economic conditions (retail energy prices and consumer confidence) are expected to normalize following a temporary disturbance (post-hurricane increase). This expectation does not inherently suggest a need to adjust monetary policy but rather indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of some economic fluctuations. The FOMC may view these changes as transitory factors that do not warrant a policy response, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
2,"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects on a historical achievement and does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy action. It simply states a fact about past economic conditions where both unemployment and inflation were low, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not provide information on whether the FOMC would tighten, ease, or maintain its monetary policy."
2,"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence compares the recent performance of inflation and unemployment with that of the 1970s, without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather reflects on historical economic conditions. The statement is more of an observation than a policy stance, and it does not provide clear guidance on future actions."
2,"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a commitment to monitoring developments that could impact the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a vigilance to ensure that the balance sheet is managed in a way that supports the Committee's goals. This suggests a balanced approach, maintaining readiness to adjust policy as needed based on new information, without a current bias toward either hawkish or dovish action."
2,"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of economic activity in major foreign industrial countries, noting variations in growth rates but not directly indicating a change in U.S. monetary policy stance. It provides context on international economic conditions, which can influence the FOMC's decisions, but it does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on foreign economic activity, without a clear link to domestic monetary policy actions or goals, leads to a classification of neutral."
2,not to target asset prices (or exchange rates).,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""not to target asset prices (or exchange rates)"" indicates a stance of not actively seeking to influence or control the levels of asset prices or exchange rates through monetary policy. This suggests a balanced approach that neither explicitly tightens nor eases monetary policy with the specific aim of affecting these financial variables. It reflects a principle of allowing market forces to determine asset prices and exchange rates, while the FOMC focuses on its broader mandates of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an intention to tighten monetary policy by gradually increasing interest rates over the year, assuming the economy progresses as expected and risks remain balanced. This approach aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, particularly if the economy is showing signs of growth that could lead to inflationary pressures. The use of ""remove accommodation"" refers to the reduction of monetary support, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to two distinct issues that can affect monetary policy: the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, which limits the central bank's ability to use traditional monetary policy tools when rates are near zero, and labor market conditions, which are a key consideration for monetary policy decisions. However, the sentence does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It merely acknowledges challenges that the FOMC must consider in its policy deliberations. The zero bound is a constraint that can necessitate unconventional policy measures, while labor market conditions are a broad area that could signal either a need for more accommodative policy (if employment is below potential) or for tightening (if the labor market is tight and causing inflation). Without additional context on the state of the labor markets or the position of interest rates relative to the zero bound, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish."
0,"Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of strong employment growth due to various factors, including progress on vaccinations, a rebound in economic activity and confidence, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate a future change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an outlook based on current conditions and policies. The mention of ""accommodative fiscal and monetary policy"" suggests that current policies are supportive of growth, but without further context on whether these policies will be maintained, increased, or decreased, the stance remains neutral."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983"" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of economic outlook rather than a policy direction. It does not explicitly suggest actions the FOMC might take regarding the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools. The sentence could be seen as positive in terms of economic growth, but without additional context on inflation or employment, it does not clearly lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the potential negative consequences of further asset purchases, such as complications in withdrawing policy accommodation, inflationary risks, and threats to financial stability. These concerns suggest a cautious or skeptical view of further easing measures, implying a preference for either maintaining the current level of monetary policy or tightening it to prevent these risks, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decline, reaching levels that are potentially below the natural rate of unemployment. This could signal a tightening labor market, which often leads to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation. In response to a tightening labor market, the FOMC might consider a more hawkish stance, potentially raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"Inflation Targeting and Central Bank Behavior,"" Federal Reserve Bank of New York, mimeo.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it appears to be a reference to a document or study (""Inflation Targeting and Central Bank Behavior,"" Federal Reserve Bank of New York, mimeo) that likely discusses the behavior of central banks in the context of inflation targeting. Without additional context on the content or conclusions of the document, it is not possible to determine whether the sentence implies a hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the classification is neutral."
