2,Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of rising agricultural crop prices and an improvement in farm revenues, which is a factual statement about a specific sector of the economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. The increase in prices could potentially signal inflationary pressures, which might be a concern for the FOMC, but the sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether this would lead to a hawkish response (tightening policy to combat inflation) or if it's a one-off situation that the FOMC might look past. Therefore, without additional context on how this observation would influence the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance is considered neutral."
2,"However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, it was noted that slower growth in productivity might have become the norm"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral observation that acknowledges a potential long-term economic trend without suggesting immediate action to either increase or decrease the federal funds rate. This statement could be seen as a basis for future policy decisions, but it does not in itself advocate for a hawkish or dovish response. It reflects an understanding of economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is considering the removal of policy accommodation, which typically means reducing monetary stimulus, such as raising interest rates or decreasing asset purchases. The phrase ""at a pace that would likely be measured"" suggests a gradual tightening of monetary policy. Although the Committee also notes its readiness to adjust policy in response to economic changes, the primary focus on removing accommodation aligns with a hawkish stance, aiming to prevent inflation and maintain price stability."
0,"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a very low target range for the federal funds rate due to low rates of resource utilization and a subdued inflation outlook. This suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing support for the economy over concerns about inflation, which is consistent with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and employment. The commitment to keeping rates low for an extended period also signals a willingness to provide ongoing monetary accommodation."
2,"Members still saw the economic expansion continuing, and most believed that inflation was likely to stabilize near recent low readings in coming quarters and then gradually rise toward levels they consider more consistent with the Committee's dual mandate for maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting continued expansion and a gradual return of inflation to target levels. It suggests neither an immediate need to tighten monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor an immediate need to ease it (which would be dovish). Instead, it reflects an expectation that the economy is moving toward the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability without specifying any imminent policy changes."
0,Most other market interest rates declined further on balance over the period in an atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's future policy actions. It notes that most market interest rates have declined and that there has been greater volatility, but it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is either looking to tighten or ease monetary policy. The decline in interest rates could be due to various factors, including market participants' expectations, and does not necessarily reflect a change in the monetary policy stance of the FOMC."
0,"Reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth, the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that productivity is growing faster than expected, which can lead to higher output without increasing inflation. Additionally, stable world economic conditions are expected to keep energy prices in check, and there is a noted decline in short-term inflation expectations among households. These factors imply that inflationary pressures are lower than previously anticipated, which could reduce the need for tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities. This action is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. The aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity suggests that the FOMC is taking measures to ease monetary conditions, which is consistent with a dovish stance. This approach is typically adopted when there is a need to boost economic activity, possibly in a context of low inflation or economic downturn, and is aligned with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Participants agreed that the longer-run normal federal funds rate was likely lower than in the past, in part because of secular forces that had put downward pressure on real interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC participants on the long-term normal federal funds rate being lower due to secular trends affecting real interest rates. This observation is a neutral assessment of economic conditions rather than a direct indication of an immediate policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an understanding of the economic environment that will inform policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,The members also agreed on the desirability of retaining the assessment that the risks with regard to the outlook for economic growth were balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a consensus on maintaining the view that the risks to economic growth are balanced. This suggests that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently, as they perceive the risks to growth as neither particularly skewed to the upside (which might be inflationary and warrant a hawkish stance) nor to the downside (which might indicate economic weakness and warrant a dovish stance). The use of the term ""balanced"" reflects a neutral stance, implying that the current policy is appropriate given the economic outlook at the time of the statement."
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the external sector will have a minor negative impact on economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of one of the many factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly indicate that the FOMC will adjust its policy in response to this influence, thus it is best classified as neutral."
0,"Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where there is an improvement in housing demand and consumer spending, which could be seen as positive indicators for the economy, but it also mentions that capital spending is weak due to business uncertainty and pessimism. This suggests that there are both positive and negative economic factors at play, which does not clearly indicate a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might view the improvement in certain areas as a sign that the economy is on the right track, while the weakness in capital spending could be seen as a risk to monitor. Overall, the sentence does not provide a clear direction for a change in monetary policy stance, hence it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"While a preemptive tightening move might be warranted in the not-too-distant future to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy, these members believed that a symmetrical directive would best convey the message that no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some members of the FOMC are considering a future tightening of monetary policy to address inflationary pressures. The use of ""preemptive tightening move"" suggests a proactive approach to prevent inflation from rising further, aligning with the goal of stable prices. Although the immediate stance is to maintain the current policy (""no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead""), the mention of a potential tightening move in the future reflects a hawkish tilt, as it prepares markets for the possibility of higher interest rates aimed at controlling inflation."
2,"In the near term, the 12-month change in PCE prices was expected to move above 2 percent as the low inflation readings from the spring of last year drop out of the calculation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising inflation, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is expected to exceed the FOMC's target of 2 percent in the near term. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too high, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures."
1,"Participants marked up their inflation projections, as they assessed that supply constraints in product and labor markets were larger and likely to be longer lasting than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants have increased their inflation projections because they believe that supply constraints in both product and labor markets are more significant and persistent than they had previously thought. This suggests a concern about higher inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract these pressures and bring inflation back towards the target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, most participants judged that inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that most participants believe inflation will stabilize at the Committee's target rate, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate to achieve their goals. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy, but rather a continuation of the current approach to maintain stability."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting improvements in the labor market and moderate economic activity, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the economy's performance relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects that a gradual adjustment in monetary policy will lead to moderate economic expansion and a strengthening labor market. This suggests a balanced approach to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without explicitly signaling a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of ""gradual adjustments"" implies a careful and measured approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
1,Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly in response to signs of rising inflation. This stance aligns with a proactive approach to curbing inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation The decision by the FOMC to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the December meeting and its retention of the ""extended period"" language in the statement were widely anticipated by market participants and elicited little price response.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past decision by the FOMC to maintain the federal funds rate and the use of specific language (""extended period"") in their communication, which was expected by the market and did not cause significant price movements. This indicates a continuation of the existing policy stance at that time, without signaling a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a steady approach consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without indicating a shift in policy direction."
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in focus from concerns about rising inflation to concerns about economic weakness. This suggests that the FOMC is more worried about a potential slowdown in economic activity than about inflation running too high. A stance that emphasizes the risks of economic weakness typically aligns with a dovish monetary policy, which may involve maintaining lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment. The absence of a balanced risk assessment further implies that the FOMC is leaning towards policies that could ease monetary conditions rather than tighten them."
2,"In the housing sector, demand had continued to display appreciable strength in recent months in association with relatively moderate mortgage rates and very positive consumer assessments of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the housing sector, noting strong demand, moderate mortgage rates, and positive consumer sentiment toward homebuying. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of ""moderate mortgage rates"" suggests that the current monetary policy stance is neither exerting significant upward nor downward pressure on interest rates in the housing market, aligning with a neutral policy stance."
0,"Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates signs of a weakening labor market, with layoffs in financial services, softer demand for temporary workers, and a continued decline in construction employment. These conditions suggest that the economy might be slowing down, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of these negative trends implies that there may be less concern about inflationary pressures and more focus on stimulating economic activity to prevent a downturn."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of increased economic growth, which is generally a positive sign for the economy, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy. The forecast of faster GDP growth could be consistent with either maintaining the current policy stance or adjusting it in the future, depending on how the growth aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of a ""modest increase"" and a ""sizable turnaround"" suggests some improvement in economic conditions, but without further context on inflation or employment, it does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that one member of the FOMC did not see the need for further policy accommodation because they did not expect any significant impact on economic growth and unemployment, and they did not agree with the assessment that the economic activity and inflation outlook warranted such action. This suggests a stance against easing monetary policy, which is typically associated with a hawkish view. The member's perspective implies a belief that the current state of the economy does not require additional stimulus, which aligns with a tightening or less accommodative approach to monetary policy."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed situation where employment growth is decelerating, but the unemployment rate is not increasing, suggesting a potentially balanced but cautious economic outlook. This could be interpreted as the labor market not overheating (which might be hawkish) nor weakening significantly (which might be dovish), thus warranting a neutral stance."
1,"Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a proactive approach to tightening monetary policy in anticipation of potential inflation, even before it becomes evident. This indicates a stance towards preventing inflation from rising, aligning with the goal of stable prices, and suggests a willingness to potentially sacrifice some short-term economic growth for long-term stability. Tightening monetary policy is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation."
2,"In the household sector, the rise in home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home-price appreciation appeared to have remained sluggish.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically within the household sector, noting a slowdown in the increase of home mortgage debt and sluggish home-price appreciation. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of certain economic indicators that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions. The statement reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators but does not in itself suggest a change in the stance of monetary policy."
1,"The Committee also noted that output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had appeared to pick up, and although incoming data on inflation showed that it had moved somewhat higher, longer-term inflation expectations had remained well contained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economy is expanding at a solid pace and hiring is increasing, which are signs of economic strength. Additionally, the mention of inflation moving somewhat higher, even though longer-term expectations are contained, suggests a potential concern for inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"These members indicated that the economic outlook remained positive and that they anticipated, under an unchanged policy stance, continued strong labor market conditions and solid growth in activity, with inflation gradually moving up to the Committee's 2 percent objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the members are optimistic about the economic outlook, expecting strong labor market conditions and solid growth, with inflation moving towards the Committee's 2 percent target. This implies that the current policy stance is appropriate and may even hint at the need for future tightening to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Price inflation had picked up a little but, abstracting from energy, had remained relatively subdued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in price inflation, the core inflation (excluding volatile energy prices) remains relatively subdued. This suggests that the FOMC sees some inflationary pressures but not enough to warrant a clear shift towards a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy (hawkish) or a need for easing (dovish). The statement appears to be balanced, reflecting an observation without a strong indication of immediate policy action."
2,"With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of economic growth slowing down to align with the potential output growth, which suggests a normalization of economic conditions without explicitly indicating a need for a change in monetary policy. It does not signal a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather indicates an observation of economic trends that are expected to occur. This aligns with the FOMC's balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and adjusting policy as needed to maintain its long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members do not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy due to the expectation that inflation will remain low for some time. This suggests a leaning towards maintaining or easing the current policy stance rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The emphasis on the lack of urgency and the consideration of international reactions further supports a stance that is not in favor of immediate tightening."
0,"However, a couple of participants noted that the recent oil price decline could also be associated with increasing oil supply rather than softening global demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion about the reasons behind a recent oil price decline, attributing it potentially to increasing oil supply rather than a decrease in global demand. This statement does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions. The focus on the supply side of oil prices, in this case, does not clearly indicate a stance towards changing the monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is a neutral observation within the broader context of economic factors that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions."
1,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is strong, with solid job gains and a low unemployment rate. This suggests that the economy is closer to achieving the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that fiscal policy changes might result in a stronger expansion of economic activity than currently anticipated. This could potentially lead to higher inflation or an overheating economy, which would require the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of its key goals. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the producer price index for core intermediate materials, which is a measure of inflation at the production level, continued to decline. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not building up at the earlier stages of production, which could imply that there is less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation. The fact that the decline is at a slower pace than previously may be noted, but the overall trend is still downward, which aligns with a dovish stance."
2,"Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an external factor (unseasonably warm weather) on economic indicators, which adds uncertainty to the data interpretation. It does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a need for careful analysis of the data due to potential temporary effects on employment and housing indicators. The FOMC is acknowledging that nonmonetary factors can influence economic conditions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to policy-making."
2,"The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its March projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather suggests a steady, typical level of economic uncertainty. It implies that the FOMC's outlook is neither particularly concerned (which might be hawkish) nor optimistic (which might be dovish) about the need for immediate policy adjustments."
0,"However, the dollar partially retraced these increases following the much weaker-than-expected U. S. employment report for May, finishing the period a bit stronger against the currencies of the AFEs and about 3 percent higher against EME currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market reaction to an economic data release (the U.S. employment report for May) and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply reports on currency fluctuations following the release of employment data, which is a reflection of market sentiment and does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC."
2,"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation, which suggests that the Committee is concerned about potential inflationary pressures. Being ""particularly vigilant"" implies that the FOMC is ready to act, possibly by tightening monetary policy, to ensure inflation remains in check. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and suggests a stance that is prepared to counteract rising inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
1,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending."" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a potential increase in investment, which could lead to higher incomes and spending, but it does not specify whether this would require a policy adjustment. The sentence is more descriptive of economic conditions and possibilities rather than prescriptive of monetary policy actions. It reflects an understanding of the economic factors that can influence the FOMC's goals but does not signal a specific policy direction."
2,"Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed,","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC expects a slowdown in economic activity, which would likely lead to a reduction in pressure on labor resources. This suggests that there is less concern about overheating in the labor market that could lead to inflationary pressures. Therefore, the statement leans toward a dovish stance, indicating that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to cool down the economy."
1,"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise due to the end or reversal of temporary factors that were keeping prices low. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,The staff's forecast for core PCE price inflation this year was revised down a little in response to recent data.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's forecast for core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price inflation has been revised downward due to recent data. This suggests that inflation pressures may be less than previously expected, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment and economic growth, as there is less immediate need to counteract high inflation."
1,"When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to adjust policy in a balanced manner, aiming to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a measured approach to future policy changes. This balanced approach reflects a neutral stance, as it does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish direction but maintains a commitment to the FOMC's long-term objectives."
2,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion among FOMC members about the uncertain relationship between the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation, as well as uncertainty regarding future productivity. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The members are acknowledging uncertainties in the economic outlook, which is consistent with a neutral stance as they are neither indicating a clear move towards a more aggressive (hawkish) nor a more accommodative (dovish) policy action."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is monitoring various economic indicators, including monetary aggregates (like money supply), their velocities (how quickly money circulates), and overall economic and financial developments, to assess progress toward their goal of price level stability. This approach suggests a balanced and data-driven stance, without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus on evaluating these factors in relation to their primary goal of price stability does not inherently suggest an imminent policy shift but rather a continued assessment of the economic situation."
1,Participants' concerns about inflation prospects generally had increased over the intermeeting period.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants of the FOMC meeting have grown more concerned about inflation prospects, which suggests they may consider tightening monetary policy to address rising inflation and steer it towards their target rate. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and could imply a readiness to increase interest rates or take other contractionary measures."
2,"Indicators of supply and demand conditions for small business credit were generally unchanged over the past quarter, with demand appearing to remain weak.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that the conditions for small business credit have not changed, with demand remaining weak. This suggests that there is no immediate pressure on the FOMC to adjust policy in response to changes in small business credit markets. It reflects an observation of the current economic situation without a clear implication for future policy moves."
2,Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are in a wait-and-see mode, looking for more information before deciding on any policy action. This suggests a balanced approach, neither clearly signaling an intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather to observe economic indicators more closely before making a decision. It reflects a stance of careful consideration and data dependency, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy position."
0,"While prices in equity markets had turned up from their recent lows, the cumulative losses in financial wealth incurred since early 2000 clearly were having an adverse impact on expenditures by households and the higher cost of equity capital was inhibiting business investment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is acknowledging negative impacts on the economy due to losses in financial wealth and higher costs of equity capital, which are affecting household expenditures and business investment. This suggests a concern for economic slowdown, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and counteract these adverse effects."
1,"Nonetheless, participants noted a risk that the drop-back in inflation could be slower or more limited than the Committee would find desirable since resource utilization was currently tight and the pickup in price increases had been broadly based rather than being limited to a few specific sectors that could be linked to energy costs.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation may not decrease as quickly or as much as desired due to high levels of resource utilization and widespread price increases across various sectors, not just limited to energy costs. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent persistent inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation even in the face of tight resource utilization (which could be indicative of a strong labor market)."
2,One participant suggested that the economic projections would be more understandable if they were based on a common interest rate path.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a comment on the clarity and understandability of economic projections, suggesting that a common interest rate path might make these projections more comprehensible. This is more about the communication and transparency of the policy process rather than a direct indication of policy direction."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past event regarding inventory investment's contribution to output acceleration and anticipates a change in economic growth due to a moderation in inventory accumulation. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in their policy decisions. The focus on inventory levels and their impact on economic growth is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"The run-up in mortgage rates since the latter part of June was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months,","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that an increase in mortgage rates is anticipated to slightly reduce housing demand, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. Higher mortgage rates often result from higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve to control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. This action aligns with a hawkish stance, as it indicates measures to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,"With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to remove policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases, and doing so at a pace that is ""likely to be measured."" This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, albeit at a gradual pace, to prevent inflation from rising. The use of ""measured"" implies a cautious approach to tightening, which aligns with the goal of maintaining stable prices without disrupting the pursuit of maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"Nonetheless, the reported rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months could presage a broader increase in job growth and thus was a welcome development.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on employment trends, suggesting that the increase in temporary workers might lead to broader job growth. This observation is a factual statement about labor market conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather acknowledges a potentially positive development in line with the FOMC's employment goals."
0,"still outpace that of potential over this period, leading to a decline in the unemployment rate to historically low levels, as monetary policy was assumed to remain highly accommodative.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that monetary policy is expected to remain ""highly accommodative,"" which typically means that the Federal Reserve is inclined to keep interest rates low to support economic activity. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus is on stimulating the economy, often in the context of low inflation and a need to boost employment or prevent unemployment from rising. The reference to historically low unemployment levels suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing employment, which aligns with a dovish policy when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's practice of considering a range of economic indicators to inform their policy decisions. The focus on projections for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not reveal any particular stance towards increasing or decreasing the monetary policy's restrictiveness."
2,"Participants expected that productivity growth would pick up as firms slowed hiring to a pace more in line with output growth but acknowledged that the improvement might be limited, particularly if business investment spending were to remain soft.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about productivity growth and its relationship with hiring practices and business investment spending. It does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The expectation of productivity growth aligning with output growth suggests a balanced view of economic progress, while the acknowledgment of potential limitations due to soft business investment spending indicates awareness of downside risks. Neither of these points directly suggests an imminent change in monetary policy stance."
0,Consumer spending firmed somewhat during the first quarter despite the rising unemployment rate and significant financial strains.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that consumer spending has strengthened somewhat, which is a positive economic sign, but it also acknowledges the negative factors of a rising unemployment rate and significant financial strains. This mixed information does not clearly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it presents both an improvement in one area of the economy and deterioration in others. The FOMC might see the firming of consumer spending as a sign of economic resilience, while the rising unemployment could be a concern that might warrant accommodative measures. However, without a clear direction on the balance of these factors, the stance remains neutral."
0,"Members saw the persistence of a relatively vigorous expansion in overall economic activity as a likely prospect in the context of continuing stimulus from fiscal and monetary policies, accommodative financial conditions, growing business optimism, favorable consumer sentiment, and robust increases in productivity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that members of the FOMC expect a strong expansion in economic activity, supported by ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus, positive financial conditions, and increasing productivity. This outlook suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Members noted that they expected to maintain this target range until they were confident that the economy had weathered recent events and was on track to achieve the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members plan to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate until they are assured that the economy has overcome recent challenges and is aligned with the Committee's goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a stance of monetary easing or at least a commitment to not tighten monetary policy until certain economic conditions are met, which aligns with a dovish policy stance. The focus on waiting for improvements in employment and price stability before making changes implies a cautious approach to tightening, which is characteristic of dovish monetary policy."
1,It was also noted that the weakness in homebuilding along with the continued rise in house prices suggested that supply constraints were also weighing on construction activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the current economic conditions, specifically in the housing sector, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges a weakness in homebuilding and a rise in house prices, attributing these trends to supply constraints. This does not clearly indicate whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply diagnoses an issue without prescribing a policy action. The statement is more focused on explaining the economic situation rather than signaling a future move in monetary policy."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about high core inflation levels, despite a modest improvement. Their emphasis on the need for ""further moderation"" suggests they are inclined to take action to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down towards their target level. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by measures to control inflation, often through raising interest rates or other contractionary policies."
1,Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants expect higher inflation due to cyclical pressures from a tightening labor market. This expectation of higher inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to cool down economic activity and control inflation."
2,"The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a commitment to monitoring developments that could impact the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes ongoing vigilance and information gathering. This suggests a balanced approach, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3. This action in itself does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a framework within which the FOMC aims to manage the money supply to support its broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The establishment of growth ranges for monetary aggregates is a tool used to guide the economy towards the FOMC's targets, but without additional context on whether these ranges are higher or lower than previous ones, or how they relate to the current economic conditions, it is not possible to determine a hawkish or dovish stance. Therefore, the statement is classified as neutral."
2,"Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Beyond 2017, the forecast for real GDP growth was little revised"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for a change in monetary policy. It simply states that the expectations for economic growth have not significantly changed. This suggests a steady outlook without implying a need for immediate policy adjustments to either tighten or ease monetary conditions. It reflects a balanced view consistent with maintaining the current policy stance, rather than signaling a shift towards more hawkish or dovish measures."
1,"However, participants generally saw these downward pressures on inflation starting to abate next year, with widespread distribution of vaccines reducing social-distancing concerns and spurring economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that participants expect inflationary pressures to decrease as the economy recovers with the distribution of vaccines, which implies that there may be less need for accommodative monetary policy measures in the future. This anticipation of reduced inflationary pressures and increased economic activity could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of strong employment conditions and increased household net worth could be seen as supportive of consumer spending (potentially inflationary), but this is counterbalanced by the reference to ""a number of limiting factors,"" which implies there are also downside risks to the economic outlook. This balanced perspective does not clearly signal a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it highlights the importance of business spending as a determinant of economic activity, which is a factor the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The focus on business spending suggests that the FOMC is monitoring economic indicators to inform future policy moves, but it does not reveal a clear intent to either increase or decrease the monetary policy's restrictiveness."
2,The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged"" does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC's view on inflation has not shifted, implying that their current policy stance is likely to remain the same as it was before this assessment. This reflects a balanced approach consistent with their ongoing assessment of economic conditions relative to their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Though labor markets were expected to remain relatively tight for some time, the members saw little prospect that inflation would gather significant momentum in coming quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite tight labor markets, which could typically lead to inflationary pressures due to increased wages, the FOMC members do not anticipate a significant acceleration in inflation. This implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to counteract inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or easing current policy to support employment."
2,"The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening nor easing monetary policy, but rather is keeping its options open to respond to economic changes as necessary. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as it implies a readiness to adjust policy in either direction to support these objectives."
2,"Recent increases in house prices and equity prices were positives,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Recent increases in house prices and equity prices were positives"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact that could be interpreted as a positive development in the economy, which might be associated with economic growth and increased wealth for homeowners and investors. This could be seen as neutral because it does not explicitly suggest any immediate action or change in policy by the FOMC. It acknowledges positive economic indicators without providing a direct link to policy adjustments."
2,"Moreover, the expected strength in aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC anticipates strong aggregate demand, which could limit the degree of disinflation, implying a potential concern for inflationary pressures. This expectation might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"However, other participants observed that measures of longer-term inflation compensation derived from financial instruments had remained stable of late, and that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations also had not changed appreciably, on net, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that measures of longer-term inflation expectations, both from financial instruments and surveys, have remained stable recently. This suggests that there is no clear pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations, as they are neither rising (which might suggest a hawkish stance) nor falling (which might suggest a dovish stance). The stability aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining inflation around the 2% target over the long term, and the lack of change does not signal a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that core consumer price inflation will remain low or even decrease, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This dovish stance implies a leaning towards maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic activity, as low inflation is not seen as a threat to the FOMC's goal of stable prices around the 2% target."
1,They noted that the economy had entered the new year with considerable momentum and very few indications that growth was moderating from what appeared to be an unsustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is growing at a potentially unsustainable rate, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to slow down economic growth and prevent the economy from overheating, thereby aiming to achieve stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. A widening trade deficit could have various implications for the economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond by tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an economic observation without a clear direction on the policy response."
1,Any such rise in inflation expectations and associated upward pressure on inflation itself would likely prove costly to reverse.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation expectations and the subsequent impact on actual inflation, which could be difficult to reverse. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from escalating, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, which are typical hawkish measures to control inflation."
1,"More fundamentally, however, the members believed that current growth in aggregate demand, should it persist, would continue to exceed the expansion of potential output and, by putting added pressure on already tight labor markets, would at some point foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economic expansion.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that persistent growth in aggregate demand exceeding the expansion of potential output could lead to inflationary pressures due to tight labor markets. This suggests that the FOMC members are considering the possibility of tightening monetary policy to prevent inflationary imbalances and maintain economic stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a process by which FOMC participants submit their economic assessments and policy views. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather outlines the procedure for gathering information that will inform policy decisions. The focus is on the collection of diverse perspectives rather than a commitment to a particular policy stance."
2,"The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the broad set of factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment. It reflects a balanced approach to assessing economic conditions, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,A couple of participants remarked that the very low levels of inventories would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants believe low inventory levels could lead to increased production as demand recovers. This observation is more of an economic forecast than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather comments on a factor that could influence economic activity. The sentence reflects an expectation of economic recovery without directly linking to a change in monetary policy stance."
2,"Some members observed that while slower growth in consumer spending was the most probable forecast, they saw an upside risk from the wealth effects of the large rise that had occurred in the value of stock market holdings.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members are concerned about the potential for increased consumer spending due to higher stock market valuations, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This concern about an ""upside risk"" to inflation implies that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,The invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were likely to weigh on economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the invasion and related events are causing increased inflationary pressures and are expected to have a negative impact on economic activity. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract the inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation even at the potential cost of slowing down economic activity. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
0,still being clear about the Committee's intention to provide the monetary accommodation needed to support a return to maximum employment and stable prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee intends to provide monetary accommodation, which typically means implementing policies to lower interest rates or otherwise stimulate the economy. This is consistent with a dovish stance, as it suggests a focus on supporting economic growth and employment, and a willingness to tolerate or address below-target inflation. The commitment to ""a return to maximum employment and stable prices"" implies that the current situation may be below these targets, and the Committee is prepared to ease monetary policy to achieve its goals."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee believes additional tightening of monetary policy (""measured policy firming"") is likely necessary to maintain a balance between sustainable economic growth and price stability. This suggests a stance towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish monetary policy approach."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It outlines the broad goals of the FOMC, which are to foster maximum employment and price stability, but does not indicate any immediate action towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance. The directive is a restatement of the Committee's objectives rather than a signal of a shift in policy."
0,"Measures of core inflation remained much more subdued, although they also moved up in some countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of inflation trends without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges a slight increase in core inflation but also emphasizes that it remains subdued, which does not strongly suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing. This reflects a balanced view that is neither overtly concerned with rising inflation (which would be hawkish) nor suggesting that inflation is too low (which would be dovish)."
2,"Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U. S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a view on the relationship between U.S. economic performance and global economic growth, without directly indicating a stance on the adjustment of monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic interdependencies."
0,"Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U. S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U. S. economy; a larger-than-expected U. S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes potential risks to the U.S. economy from external factors, such as issues in the euro zone, U.S. fiscal policy, and global economic growth. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather outlines concerns that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC is acknowledging uncertainties that could impact their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as their goal of moderate long-term interest rates. This awareness of risks is part of their balanced approach to monitoring economic conditions and adjusting policy as needed."
1,"Although the initial offerings of these securities were well received, investor demand at the most recent sales was not as strong, a development consistent with the declines in the prices of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding investor demand and security prices, without directly indicating a clear stance on monetary policy adjustments. It does not explicitly suggest actions towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reports on financial market conditions."
1,"It was noted, however, that increases in compensation that exceeded productivity gains might be absorbed to some extent by a narrowing of firms’ high profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the relationship between compensation increases, productivity gains, and firms' profit margins. It suggests that if compensation increases outpace productivity, it might not necessarily lead to inflationary pressure if firms absorb the costs through reduced profit margins. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a potential mitigating factor in the inflation dynamics. It reflects a balanced view on how wage trends could interact with corporate profits and inflation, without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
1,"Recent data suggested that growth of household spending had picked up, while business fixed investment had continued to grow strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is an increase in household spending and that business investment continues to grow strongly, which suggests a healthy economy. However, it does not directly imply a need for immediate monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. The statement is simply reporting observed economic conditions without a clear directional bias towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable economic growth, which is consistent with their mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not in itself signal a change in the stance of monetary policy."
2,Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable"" suggests that inflation expectations are neither rising nor falling significantly, which indicates that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining expectations in line with the Committee's long-term inflation goal. This stability does not imply an immediate need for a change in policy to either tighten or ease conditions, hence the classification as neutral."
2,"In light of these significant policy actions, the risks to growth were now thought to be more closely balanced by the risks to inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the risks to economic growth and inflation as being more evenly matched following recent policy measures. This indicates a stance where they are not particularly leaning towards tightening or easing policies but are observing the effects of their recent actions. The balance between growth and inflation risks implies that the FOMC believes their current policy is appropriately calibrated to address their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish adjustment."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's broad and ongoing mandate to foster conditions that will lead to maximum employment and price stability, which is a general statement of purpose rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reaffirms the Committee's commitment to its dual mandate."
2,Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Equity prices in most foreign countries were up moderately since the January FOMC meeting"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is merely an observation of market conditions, which does not inherently suggest a policy action to either increase or decrease interest rates or adjust monetary policy. It does not provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates in relation to the FOMC's goals."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there may be a need for more tightening overall, an accelerated pace of tightening is not deemed necessary at the moment. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for some tightening (which could be seen as hawkish) but also recognizing factors that allow for a more measured pace, such as economic slack, productivity growth, and contained inflation (which could be seen as dovish). The Committee is weighing the risks and appears to be taking a middle ground, neither signaling an immediate tightening nor an easing of policy."
0,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that the coronavirus outbreak was causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the context in which the FOMC is making its policy decisions, acknowledging the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on human and economic conditions. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather sets the stage for the considerations that will inform the Committee's policy actions. The focus is on the challenges posed by the pandemic rather than on specific monetary policy adjustments."
2,"In any event, it was clear that forecasts in recent years typically had overstated the rise in inflation, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the extent to which productivity gains and other factors, some unspecified, might continue to hold down inflation in a period of robust economic growth and relatively tight labor markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges past inaccuracies in inflation forecasts and suggests uncertainty regarding the impact of productivity gains and other factors on inflation, despite strong economic growth and tight labor markets. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather communicates a balanced view of the economic situation, with an emphasis on the unpredictability of inflation trends. This reflects a neutral stance, as it neither commits to a hawkish policy of raising rates in response to inflation fears nor suggests a dovish stance of lowering rates due to lack of inflationary pressure."
2,Several saw that outlook as depending importantly on continued strengthening of the labor market or on an above-trend pace of economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members believe that a positive economic outlook is contingent on a continued strengthening of the labor market or an economic activity pace that exceeds the trend. This implies an expectation of robust economic conditions, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
0,Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is being kept in check by reduced demand and lower oil prices, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that the FOMC might lean towards an easing stance to support demand, aligning with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that real yields (interest rates adjusted for inflation) have increased more than nominal yields, and the market's expectation for inflation (inflation compensation) has declined. This scenario suggests that monetary policy may be tightening, as higher real yields can be a result of increased interest rates set by the FOMC to combat inflation. The decline in inflation expectations could reflect the market's belief that the FOMC's actions will be effective in controlling inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In the emerging market economies (EMEs), a pickup in growth in China in the second quarter, supported by policy stimulus, appeared to be more than offset by slower growth in Latin America.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in emerging market economies, noting a balance between growth in China due to policy stimulus and slower growth in Latin America. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, nor does it provide clear implications for the U.S. monetary policy stance. Instead, it offers a neutral observation of international economic developments."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of price stability and sustainable growth, which are consistent with its long-term objectives. The sentence does not provide information on immediate policy actions or changes in stance, such as raising or lowering interest rates, which would be necessary to classify it as hawkish or dovish."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on maintaining an accommodative policy stance to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish approach. It emphasizes the importance of keeping monetary policy easy, particularly when the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate limits conventional policy tools. This approach is aimed at supporting the economy to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, suggesting that the Committee is inclined to ease rather than tighten monetary policy to meet these objectives."
0,Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there is limited room for using monetary policy to further stimulate the economy to combat unemployment without potentially causing other issues, such as inflation. This suggests a stance that leans towards avoiding additional monetary policy easing, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges in predicting economic outcomes. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (suggesting tightening) nor dovish (suggesting easing), but rather acknowledges the complexities in making monetary policy decisions."
0,These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is still significant slack in the labor markets, implying that a decrease in unemployment would not lead to inflationary pressures. This indicates that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or to ease further to support employment without risking the FOMC's inflation target, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. activity was revised upward, suggesting an improvement in economic conditions. This could imply that the economy is performing better than previously thought, potentially leading to higher inflation or overheating, which might necessitate a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding the target. A revision upward in economic projections can be associated with a hawkish stance if it leads the FOMC to consider raising interest rates or otherwise reducing monetary accommodation to keep the economy from overheating and inflation from rising too quickly."
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests that the current policy settings are aligned with the members' expectations for economic growth and inflation, implying that the current stance is appropriate given the existing economic forecasts. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability, without signaling a need for immediate policy adjustment."
1,"Several participants discussed the possible complications that additional purchases could cause for the eventual withdrawal of policy accommodation, a few mentioned the prospect of inflationary risks, and some noted that further asset purchases could foster market behavior that could undermine financial stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about the potential negative consequences of further asset purchases, such as complications in withdrawing policy accommodation, inflationary risks, and threats to financial stability. These concerns suggest a cautious or restrictive stance towards additional monetary easing, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy and to maintain price stability, which is consistent with a hawkish viewpoint."
0,"First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an assessment or revision of economic indicators, specifically productivity and potential output growth. Adjusting projections for these factors is part of the FOMC's regular analysis and does not inherently suggest a move to either raise or lower interest rates. It is a neutral statement that could be a precursor to either a hawkish or dovish policy decision, depending on how the FOMC interprets the impact of these revised projections on their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies that the conditions are expected to improve without the need for tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and potentially allows for a more accommodative policy to maintain or encourage these gains."
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the current accommodative stance of monetary policy is expected to contribute to a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in unemployment. This implies that the FOMC is maintaining an easing policy stance to support the economy, which is consistent with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The use of the term ""accommodative"" indicates that the FOMC is actively working to stimulate economic growth and employment, aligning with the goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"In their discussion of the economic situation and outlook, meeting participants noted that the economic information received since the last meeting pointed to a somewhat more favorable outlook regarding both inflation and economic growth than they had earlier anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the economic outlook is more favorable than previously anticipated in terms of both inflation and economic growth. This suggests that the economy may be performing better, with higher growth and inflation potentially moving towards the Committee's target. A more favorable outlook could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"In keeping with its usual procedures under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, the Committee would review its ranges at midyear, or sooner if interim conditions warranted, in light of the growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates and ongoing economic and financial developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a standard procedural action by the FOMC to review its policy ranges in response to economic and financial developments. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a data-dependent approach that could lead to adjustments as necessary. The mention of reviewing policy in light of growth and velocity behavior of the aggregates (which typically refers to monetary aggregates) and ongoing developments indicates a balanced and responsive approach, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to adapt its policy in response to changing economic conditions."
0,Domestic respondents to the April SLOOS generally reported tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand across all major CRE loan categories during the first quarter.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that domestic respondents are tightening their lending standards and experiencing weaker loan demand, which suggests a contractionary or tightening trend in monetary conditions. Tightening lending standards can be a response to concerns about economic overheating, inflation, or financial stability, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to prevent excessive inflation and ensure stable prices."
2,"If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential implications of a slower rate of price declines in high-tech products on investment demand and productivity growth. It does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather assesses economic conditions and their potential impact on future growth. The focus is on understanding economic indicators and their influence on the overall economy, which is consistent with the FOMC's balanced approach to monitoring a range of economic factors."
2,"Nonetheless, those restraining influences were expected to abate over time and economic activity strengthen gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are currently restraining influences on economic activity, these are expected to diminish over time, leading to a gradual strengthening of the economy. This statement does not explicitly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather conveys an expectation of natural economic improvement. It implies a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as the FOMC monitors how the economy evolves relative to its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"The unemployment rate was unchanged over the period between the April and June meetings,","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the unemployment rate remaining unchanged over a specific period, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest any immediate concerns about employment levels that would prompt a change in policy to either tighten or ease. The FOMC might view this stability in the unemployment rate as being in line with their goal of maximum employment, thus not necessitating a change in stance."
2,"Regarding the economic outlook, most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC participants on the expectation of moderate economic growth, which is expected to accelerate gradually. This outlook suggests a balanced view of the economy without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. It reflects an anticipation of steady progress towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling immediate concerns over inflationary pressures or employment shortfalls that would necessitate a change in policy stance."
2,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed"" indicates that there has been no significant shift in the public's expectations for inflation in the long term. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is maintaining stable inflation expectations, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of price stability. The sentence does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral. It reflects a situation where the FOMC's current policy is considered to be effectively anchoring inflation expectations without signaling any immediate concerns that would prompt a change in policy stance."
0,"A number of participants noted that continued high unemployment, particularly with large numbers of workers suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead to an erosion of workers' skills that would have adverse consequences for those workers and for the economy's potential level of output in the longer term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern over high unemployment and its long-term negative effects on the economy, suggesting that the FOMC might favor policies that support employment, even at the risk of higher inflation in the short term. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which typically involves keeping interest rates lower to stimulate economic activity and improve labor market conditions."
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty about the current level of resource slack in the economy, which suggests that the FOMC is considering both the possibility of the economy operating close to its potential and the potential for further gains in employment. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of uncertainty and the conditional nature of the statement (""if labor force participation rates did not turn up much"") implies that the FOMC is waiting for more information before making a decisive move in either direction."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it mentions the need for ""special vigilance."" This suggests that the FOMC is closely monitoring economic indicators and may be prepared to act, possibly by raising interest rates, to preempt inflationary pressures or other economic imbalances, in line with their goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. The use of ""asymmetric directive"" implies that there is a greater likelihood of tightening than easing, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or curbing high inflation."
0,"Participants generally agreed that the drag on U. S. economic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign economic growth, particularly in emerging market economies, was likely to continue to depress U. S. net exports for some time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, specifically the impact of a stronger dollar and slower growth in foreign economies on U.S. net exports. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather assesses the economic landscape, which the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. The focus is on understanding the economic situation rather than signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"At the same time, however, the near-term outlook for inflation had deteriorated, and the risks that underlying inflation pressures could prove to be greater than anticipated appeared to have risen.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could be higher than expected in the near term, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on controlling inflation, even at the potential cost of slower economic growth or higher unemployment in the short term."
0,"Some members expressed a concern that in this context any further adverse shocks could have disproportionate effects, resulting in a significant slowing in growth going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members are worried about the potential for adverse shocks to have a larger-than-expected negative impact on economic growth. This concern for economic fragility typically aligns with a dovish stance, as it implies a readiness to implement or maintain an accommodative monetary policy to support the economy and prevent a slowdown in growth. It indicates a focus on the FOMC's goal of maximum employment and stable prices, with a willingness to act against negative shocks that could derail these objectives."
2,"On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and core inflation, which excludes changes in food and energy prices, had remained near 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation rates are close to the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively maintaining price stability. There is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease the policy based on this information alone, as the inflation rate is near the desired level."
1,"With today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking action to increase the real federal funds rate to a level above the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation rate, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy. Moving the real federal funds rate into positive territory implies a stance that is aimed at containing inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish policy approach. This action aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests that they are adjusting policy to counteract higher inflation."
0,"Staff Review of the Financial Situation On balance, financial conditions in the United States remained supportive of growth in economic activity and employment: The expected path of the federal funds rate was slightly lower in the long run, yields on longer-term Treasury securities moved down modestly, equity prices rose, corporate bond spreads narrowed, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that financial conditions are supportive of growth and employment, with a lower expected path for the federal funds rate, modest decreases in long-term Treasury yields, rising equity prices, and narrowing corporate bond spreads. These conditions suggest an easing of monetary policy, as they are conducive to economic growth and do not point towards tightening measures to combat inflation. The description of a slightly lower expected path for the federal funds rate is particularly indicative of a dovish stance, as it implies that interest rates may be lower in the future, which is typically associated with efforts to stimulate economic activity."
2,"In contrast, Spanish economic activity stagnated in the third quarter, Greek GDP extended its decline, and more-recent indicators point to continued weakness in peripheral European economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in peripheral European economies, which is an observation of international economic performance rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in its decision-making process. The focus on external economies does not directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States."
0,"In that regard, the prospective strength of demand pressures and related outlook for productivity were subject to a wide range of uncertainty, and there were reasons to believe that economic growth could well slow without any adjustment to policy.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is uncertainty about demand pressures and productivity, with an indication that economic growth might slow down even without any policy changes. This suggests that there may be no immediate need to tighten monetary policy, as slowing growth could alleviate inflationary pressures, aligning with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or easing current policy to support economic growth."
0,"Even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for August showed weak job gains.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the employment report for August, even after accounting for the effects of strikes, showed weak job gains. This suggests that the labor market is not overheating and may be underperforming, which could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to cool down the economy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, weak job gains could be a sign that the economy is not at risk of overheating, and therefore, there may be room for a more accommodative (dovish) policy stance to support employment."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat"" suggests that expectations for future inflation have decreased, which could imply that there is less pressure on prices to rise. This could be interpreted as a sign that the economy is not overheating, and therefore, there may be less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In a dovish stance, the central bank might be more inclined to keep interest rates lower to support economic activity, as lower inflation expectations reduce the urgency to raise rates."
1,"Job gains had been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the labor market is performing well, with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. This reflects positively on the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the sentence does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, as it does not explicitly mention inflation pressures or the need for interest rate adjustments. It simply states a current economic condition without a clear directional policy implication."
2,"Members agreed that their policy decisions would remain data dependent, and they continued to include wording in the statement noting that if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely occur sooner than currently anticipated, and, similarly, that if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range would likely occur later than currently anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that if progress on employment and inflation is faster than expected, the FOMC would likely increase the target range for the federal funds rate sooner, which is a sign of tightening monetary policy. Conversely, it also states that if progress is slower, rate increases would be delayed, but the readiness to act more quickly on positive data signals a hawkish stance, emphasizing the Committee's focus on preventing inflation from rising above their target."
0,"Despite the substantial monetary easing that had been implemented already and the fiscal stimulus, including federal tax rebates, that was in train, the forecast anticipated that sluggish hiring and the decline in household wealth would restrain the growth of both consumer spending and housing demand.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that, despite significant monetary easing and fiscal stimulus measures already in place, there is an expectation of continued weak consumer spending and housing demand due to slow hiring and a decrease in household wealth. This suggests that the economy is not overheating and that there may be room for further monetary easing to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate the economy."
1,"In this regard, members referred to earlier unsustainable rates of investment by many high-tech firms that were now obliged to retrench despite still high rates of growth in the demand for their products and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where high-tech firms are experiencing high demand but are also undergoing a period of retrenchment due to previous unsustainable rates of investment. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions, particularly in the high-tech sector, without suggesting an immediate need for the FOMC to adjust its policy stance in response to these conditions. It acknowledges the dynamics of the economy that the FOMC must consider, but it does not provide information on whether the Committee would see this as a reason to change interest rates or adjust its monetary policy tools."
2,"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of inflation compensation without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It notes a modest decline in inflation compensation, possibly due to lower energy prices, but also mentions stability at longer maturities. This suggests a balanced view of inflation expectations, without signaling an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,The unemployment rate fell to 5.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""The unemployment rate fell to 5%"" suggests an improvement in the labor market, which is one of the Federal Reserve's goals (maximum employment). A falling unemployment rate could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. If the unemployment rate is approaching levels that the FOMC considers to be at or below the natural rate of unemployment, the Committee might consider this an indication to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Therefore, the statement can be seen as hawkish because it may imply a need for a tighter monetary policy stance to maintain stable prices, another key goal of the FOMC."
0,"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is exhibiting strong demand and tightness, which often correlates with upward pressure on wages and potential inflationary concerns. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
2,"As yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose roughly in line with their nominal counterparts, longer-term inflation compensation remained about unchanged.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities increased approximately in line with nominal yields, indicating that the market's long-term inflation expectations did not change significantly. This observation does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather indicates a stable market outlook on inflation. The FOMC might view this stability as consistent with their inflation goals, without necessitating a change in policy stance."
1,"Yields on longer-term inflation-indexed Treasury securities, which are relatively illiquid, rose more sharply than did those on nominal securities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the yields on longer-term inflation-indexed Treasury securities rose more sharply than those on nominal securities. This suggests that there is an expectation of higher inflation in the future, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above the FOMC's target. Rising yields on inflation-indexed securities typically reflect an increase in inflation expectations among investors, which the FOMC might counter with a hawkish stance to ensure price stability."
0,"Two noted the possibility that sustained high levels of long-term unemployment could result in higher structural unemployment, an outcome that might be forestalled by increased aggregate demand.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that increasing aggregate demand could prevent a rise in structural unemployment due to sustained high levels of long-term unemployment. This implies a stance towards stimulating the economy, which is typically associated with a dovish monetary policy that favors easing to boost demand and employment."
0,"Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Further out, TIPS-based inflation compensation 5 to 10 years ahead edged down slightly on net"" indicates a slight decrease in the market's long-term inflation expectations, as measured by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). This observation is neutral because it does not strongly suggest a need for immediate monetary policy action. A slight decrease in inflation expectations could be consistent with inflation moving towards the FOMC's target, which would not necessarily warrant a clear shift towards more hawkish or dovish policy. The statement is simply reporting an observed market trend without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"A couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality, observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation; moreover, international comparisons suggested that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the U. S. economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe it is too early to consider ending or reducing the asset purchase program, suggesting they favor continued monetary support to assess the labor market and inflation more thoroughly. The mention of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet having ample capacity implies that there is room for further monetary easing relative to the size of the U.S. economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment over immediate concerns about inflation."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the participants are concerned about maintaining an accommodative policy stance to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish approach. This suggests that they are in favor of keeping monetary policy easy to support the economy and to reinforce the credibility of the Committee's policy framework, aiming to achieve both maximum employment and price stability. The mention of the ""effective lower bound on the federal funds rate"" implies that there is limited room for further rate cuts, which is a concern typically associated with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
2,"In Latin America, indicators suggested that economic activity in Mexico and Brazil expanded further in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing an observation of economic conditions in Mexico and Brazil, without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It does not directly relate to the Federal Reserve's mandate of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States, nor does it suggest a particular action such as tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months,","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Consumer prices had edged up in recent months"" suggests that there has been an increase in inflation, which is one of the key concerns for the FOMC. Given the FOMC's mandate to maintain stable prices and its inflation target of 2%, an increase in consumer prices could indicate a need for a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further. This could involve increasing the federal funds rate or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are factors supporting consumer spending, which suggests that the economy might not need a tightening of monetary policy to curb inflation or overheating. Tax rebates, declining energy prices, and discounting are all elements that can stimulate consumer spending without necessarily leading to inflationary pressures, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment without the immediate need for monetary policy tightening."
1,"Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had declined substantially.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates strong labor market conditions, with robust job gains and a significant decline in the unemployment rate. This could suggest that the economy is operating near or above its potential, which may lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"On balance, however, the members generally believed that prospective trends in overall economic activity and the persistence of strong competitive pressures in most markets, including the effects of foreign competition, were likely in the context of now firmly embedded expectations of low inflation to moderate any tendency for price inflation to accelerate over the year ahead.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members believe that economic trends and strong competitive pressures, including foreign competition, will help to keep inflation low. This suggests that they do not see a pressing need to implement policies to further ease inflationary pressures, as they expect inflation to remain moderate. The reference to ""firmly embedded expectations of low inflation"" implies that the market anticipates a stable inflation environment, which could reduce the urgency for dovish measures. Therefore, the stance is more aligned with maintaining or potentially tightening monetary policy to ensure that inflation does not rise, which is a hawkish position."
1,"Private investors would have to hold more longer-term securities as the Federal Reserve's holdings ran off, making longer-term interest rates somewhat higher than they would be otherwise.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is reducing its holdings of longer-term securities, which would lead to an increase in longer-term interest rates as private investors are required to hold more of these securities. This action is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy, as higher long-term interest rates can slow economic activity and help control inflation, aligning with the goal of stable prices."
0,"M2 expanded in February, however, as liquid deposits resumed their growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""M2 expanded in February, however, as liquid deposits resumed their growth"" is a statement of fact regarding the growth of a monetary aggregate (M2, which includes cash, checking deposits, and easily convertible near money). It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions, specifically the money supply. The expansion of M2 could be the result of previous monetary policy actions or other factors, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a future policy direction. It is neutral as it does not explicitly suggest a need to either increase or decrease the interest rate or adjust monetary policy to counteract inflation or address employment issues."
0,"Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the housing market, noting a decrease in single-family housing starts and an increase in inventories due to a lagging response to a decline in demand. This observation is a factual statement about economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a need to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on a specific sector of the economy. The FOMC might use such information to assess overall economic health and inflationary pressures, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy stance."
0,"remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, which suggests that there is less immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. The reference to earlier declines in energy prices and prices of non-energy imports as contributing factors implies that the low inflation is partly due to transitory or external factors, rather than domestic overheating, which could justify a more accommodative stance to support the economy and help move inflation towards the target."
1,Some participants mentioned upside risks around the inflation outlook that could arise if temporary factors influencing inflation turned out to be more persistent than expected.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could be higher than anticipated if certain temporary factors persist. This concern about potential higher inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding their target, which is a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
0,"Some participants believed that considerable labor market slack remained, especially when indicators other than the unemployment rate were taken into account, including the unusually large fraction of the labor force working part time for economic reasons.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants see room for improvement in the labor market, as indicated by the high number of part-time workers who would prefer full-time work. This view implies that the economy might not be overheating and that there may be less immediate need to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation. The focus on labor market slack aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally more supportive of accommodative policy measures to stimulate employment."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members were considering an easing of monetary policy to support financial markets and mitigate risks to economic growth. Easing policy typically involves lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors more accommodative monetary policy to support employment and growth when there is no significant inflationary pressure."
2,Reserve market conditions associated with this directive had been expected to be consistent with some moderation in the growth of M2 and M3 over coming months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a slowdown in the growth of the money supply (M2 and M3), which is often associated with a tightening of monetary policy. By moderating the growth of the money supply, the FOMC may be aiming to control inflation, which aligns with its goal of stable prices. This action can be seen as a preventive measure to avoid overheating the economy, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"As reflected in their SEP projections, participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members believe the current monetary policy stance is suitable and does not suggest an immediate need for change. It implies a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the status quo as long as the economic data aligns with their expectations. This stance is neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) but rather suggests contentment with the current policy in the context of their economic outlook."
0,"While anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expectation of moderation in housing activity due to various factors, including a drop in stock market prices and slower employment and income growth. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an observation of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. It acknowledges potential risks to the economy without committing to a specific monetary policy action."
0,"Recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production, while still sizable, were smaller than those registered earlier in 2009.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, noting that recent declines in payroll employment and industrial production are less severe than those earlier in the year. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides a status update on economic indicators relevant to the FOMC's goals. The statement is balanced and does not indicate a clear direction for future policy changes, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, held down in part by the effects of declines in energy and non-energy import prices.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the Committee's target, partly due to lower energy and import prices. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since the primary concern of high inflation is not present. A dovish stance is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity when inflation is subdued and not a current threat."
2,A key factor in this assessment continued to be their outlook for rapid further gains in structural productivity that would help to hold down increases in unit labor costs.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC expects structural productivity gains to keep unit labor costs from rising. This implies that the Committee might not see a need for an easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy, as productivity gains could help maintain price stability without additional monetary intervention. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this stance leans toward preventing inflation rather than stimulating employment, which is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
0,"not enough to lower the unemployment rate, and labor productivity seemed to be trending sharply upward.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that despite unemployment not decreasing, labor productivity is increasing significantly. This could indicate that the economy is operating efficiently, potentially leading to inflationary pressures if productivity leads to higher output without corresponding job growth. In this context, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that employment gains were stronger than expected, which could suggest that the economy is performing well and nearing or exceeding the FOMC's employment goals. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, especially if the labor market tightness could lead to inflationary pressures. This aligns with a hawkish stance, where the focus is on preventing too-high inflation and not necessarily on stimulating the economy further."
0,Housing activity was generally holding up well across the country as the effects of appreciably reduced mortgage interest rates apparently compensated for the negative effects of declining financial wealth on the demand for housing.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where reduced mortgage interest rates are balancing out the negative impact of declining financial wealth on housing demand. This indicates that the monetary policy adjustments are having their intended effect of stabilizing a specific sector (housing), without a clear indication of a future policy shift towards either tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced view, suggesting that the current policy is adequately addressing the situation without the need for immediate change."
1,"These policy moves would therefore prevent the far greater economic pain associated with entrenched high inflation, including the even tighter policy and more severe restraint on economic activity that would then be needed to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to take action to prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, even if it means implementing tighter policy measures now. The reference to ""more severe restraint on economic activity"" suggests a readiness to accept short-term economic pain for long-term price stability, which aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the priority is to prevent high inflation even at the cost of potentially slowing down economic activity in the near term."
2,Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the data is inconclusive or has both positive and negative aspects, which does not provide a strong basis for a shift in policy stance. Therefore, it is best classified as neutral, as it does not imply a clear action in response to economic conditions in the manufacturing sector."
2,"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions where investment performance is improving and business spending is increasing, which could balance out a moderation in household spending growth. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic situation. It suggests that the economy is experiencing a shift in the sources of growth, which could be seen as a positive development for stability, but it does not imply immediate action by the FOMC in terms of adjusting the monetary policy stance."
2,"Available information suggested that economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries continued to advance, but at an uneven pace; in Germany, activity rebounded from the contraction in the first quarter, while in Japan a considerable slowing of growth had occurred in the second quarter after very rapid expansion in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic conditions in major foreign industrial countries, noting variations in their economic growth rates. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on international economic conditions, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest actions to be taken in response to these conditions, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"In contrast, a few participants cautioned that, despite increases in market-based measures of inflation compensation in recent months and the stabilization of some survey measures of inflation expectations, the levels of these indicators remained too low to be consistent with the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern that inflation measures and expectations are still below the Committee's 2 percent target. This suggests that the participants are more worried about the risk of too-low inflation rather than too-high inflation, which could imply a stance favoring easier monetary policy to stimulate inflation towards the target level."
1,"A couple of participants referred to information from business contacts suggesting that inflation was unlikely to decline further, and a few expressed concerns that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period could erode the stability of inflation expectations over time and hence posed upside risks to the inflation outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential inflation risks associated with a prolonged accommodative monetary policy stance. The mention of the possibility that inflation expectations could become unstable over time suggests that some FOMC participants see a need to consider tightening policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target. This aligns with a hawkish view, which favors measures to prevent high inflation, even at the risk of slowing down economic growth."
2,Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most participants continued to see the risks to inflation as balanced"" suggests that the FOMC members believe that inflation risks are neither particularly skewed to the upside (which might suggest a need for tightening policy) nor to the downside (which might suggest a need for easing policy). This indicates a view that the current policy stance is appropriately calibrated to the inflation outlook, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"Even so, in the absence of major overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables, and given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed that a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting moderate and sustainable growth after a short period of weakness. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather conveys an expectation of economic stability. The mention of the absence of major overhangs in inventories and favorable conditions in financial markets implies that the current policy stance is appropriate for the expected economic conditions, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is currently low and expected to remain low due to weak commodity and import prices, as well as the influence of current low inflation on future price expectations. This suggests that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing to stimulate the economy."
2,"Mortgage credit conditions generally remained tight over the intermeeting period, though signs of easing continued to emerge amid further gains in house prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of mortgage credit conditions and the housing market without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy changes. It acknowledges some easing in credit conditions and rising house prices but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is simply observational and does not imply a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) stance."
2,"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion about the operational aspects of implementing monetary policy, specifically open market operations, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing policy. It reflects a procedural aspect of how the Federal Reserve conducts its policy rather than a stance on the future direction of policy adjustments."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation compared to the previous year, due to rising prices in specific sectors such as food and non-energy imports. This expectation of increased inflation could suggest a need for a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to higher inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members' forecasts for consumer price inflation are centered well below the Committee's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that inflation is not seen as a pressing concern at the moment, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat rising prices. Instead, the FOMC may be more inclined to maintain or even ease monetary policy to support economic activity and move inflation towards its target, reflecting a dovish stance."
0,"In the United Kingdom, however, gilt yields declined and the pound weakened against the dollar in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and to an upward revision by the Bank of England, at its early February policy meeting, of its assessment of the degree of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic observations and actions taken by the Bank of England rather than indicating a specific stance of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. It reports on the conditions in the United Kingdom, including bond yields, currency strength, and inflation data, as well as the Bank of England's assessment of labor market slack. This information does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy but rather provides context on international economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in its decision-making process."
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core consumer price inflation are low and that near-term inflation expectations have decreased, which suggests there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Additionally, the mention of a weakened economic outlook implies that there may be a need to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment."
0,"In addition, contacts reported that softer export sales, weaker economic activity abroad, and elevated levels of uncertainty regarding the global outlook were weighing on business sentiment and leading firms to reassess plans for investment spending.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that external factors such as softer export sales, weaker economic activity abroad, and high levels of global uncertainty are negatively impacting business sentiment and causing firms to reconsider investment spending. This suggests that economic conditions are not conducive to tightening monetary policy, as doing so could exacerbate the challenges businesses are facing. Instead, the FOMC might consider maintaining or easing monetary policy to support economic activity and counteract the negative effects mentioned, aligning with a dovish stance."
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically the high demand for Treasury securities and the resulting low overnight repo rate, as well as the high number of failures to deliver Treasury securities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of financial market phenomena. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
0,Recent data on core consumer prices led the staff to mark down slightly its forecast for core PCE inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff has revised its forecast for core PCE inflation downward based on recent data, suggesting that inflation pressures may be less than previously expected. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
2,"Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral observation about a specific sector of the economy, which on its own does not suggest an immediate need for a policy adjustment. This information would be one of many factors the FOMC considers when evaluating the overall economic conditions and deciding on the appropriate monetary policy stance to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Also, the recent evidence could be interpreted as indicating that the surprisingly sharp decline in measured inflation in 2003 exaggerated the drop in the underlying rate of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the actual underlying rate of inflation may not have decreased as much as the measured figures from 2003 suggested. This could mean that inflation pressures are higher than previously thought, which might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,Surveys indicated that households’ expectations of inflation over the next year were little changed in February,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been no significant change in households' expectations of inflation over the next year. This suggests that the public's outlook on inflation is stable, which does not clearly signal a need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is simply reporting observed data without implying any particular direction for policy adjustments."
2,"While favorable financing would help to sustain the housing sector, members anticipated that any further impetus to growth from that sector was likely to be limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while favorable financing conditions could support the housing sector, the FOMC members do not expect significant additional growth from this sector. This suggests a balanced view without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of the economic conditions rather than a direct statement of policy intent."
2,"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is focused on the fact that inflation is below their 2 percent target. The use of ""carefully monitor"" suggests that they are prepared to take action to move inflation towards the goal, which typically involves easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and increase price levels. This dovish stance is consistent with a readiness to introduce measures that would support the economy and push inflation closer to the desired rate, rather than tightening policy which would be expected if inflation were above the target."
1,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a noticeable increase in both short- and long-term inflation expectations according to survey measures. Rising inflation expectations can be a concern for the Federal Reserve as it aims to maintain stable prices with a long-term inflation target of 2%. If the FOMC believes that inflation expectations are moving persistently above their target, they may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent actual inflation from rising, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further data. The statement reflects a readiness to adjust policy as needed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability, but does not in itself signal a clear move in either direction."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve stable prices and support sustainable economic growth, which are key aspects of its dual mandate (the other being maximum employment). It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather states the overall goals of the Committee. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see a higher likelihood of inflation falling rather than rising, due to factors such as excess capacity in the economy (resource slack), potential declines in economic activity, and the risk of falling inflation expectations. This view suggests that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy. The focus on downside risks to inflation and real activity implies a concern for underperformance relative to the FOMC's goals of stable prices and maximum employment, which could warrant a more accommodative policy approach."
2,"In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that data over the intermeeting period, including measures of inflation expectations, suggested that underlying inflation was not in the process of moving higher.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the underlying inflation is not showing signs of increasing, which implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat rising inflation. This dovish stance indicates a potential for maintaining or easing the current monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, as there is no immediate inflationary pressure necessitating a more aggressive approach."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October"" is a factual statement about employment trends without a clear indication of a policy stance. It neither explicitly suggests that the FOMC is considering tightening nor easing monetary policy. The increase in employment is generally a positive sign for the economy and could be consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, without additional context on how this data will influence the FOMC's policy decisions, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of observation regarding economic conditions abroad, which could potentially impact the U.S. economy and thus the FOMC's policy decisions. However, without a clear indication of how this outlook would influence the FOMC's actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates, the stance remains neutral."
0,"however, apart from the energy and health care sectors, price inflation had remained relatively subdued, evidently reflecting the combination of diminished growth in overall demand and strong competitive pressures in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that, with the exception of the energy and health care sectors, price inflation has been relatively low, which is attributed to reduced growth in overall demand and strong competition in most markets. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not widespread and that there may be less need for monetary policy tightening to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support economic growth and employment."
2,Measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS fell in response to the soft reading on core inflation in the November CPI release,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations (measured by inflation compensation based on Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS) decreased after a report showed lower-than-expected core inflation. This suggests that market participants are anticipating lower inflation, which could lead to a more dovish stance by the FOMC, as there may be less pressure to raise interest rates to combat high inflation. Lower expected inflation aligns with the potential for easing monetary policy to support employment and growth, as long as inflation is under control."
0,Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices were holding down consumer price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that factors such as weaker demand and lower oil prices are contributing to lower consumer price inflation. This suggests that inflationary pressures are subdued, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy. In a dovish stance, the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate demand and move inflation closer to its 2% target, especially if inflation is running below that level."
2,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable economic growth, which are its core objectives. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes the overall goals of the Committee. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide specific information on the actions the FOMC might take to adjust monetary policy in response to economic conditions."
2,Participants commented that demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the demand for labor is exceeding the available supply, and businesses are facing challenges in hiring and retaining workers. This situation suggests that the labor market is tight, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Crude oil prices continued to rise, reaching record levels in nominal terms over the intermeeting period"" is a statement of fact regarding commodity prices and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest whether the FOMC is inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on economic conditions that might influence the FOMC's decision-making. Rising crude oil prices could lead to inflationary pressures, which might warrant a hawkish response, but the sentence itself does not commit to any particular action or indicate the Committee's response to this information."
2,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the full range of the Federal Reserve's tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary policy in order to promote employment and price stability. This is particularly aimed at addressing the challenges mentioned, which implies a willingness to potentially lower interest rates or engage in other expansionary activities to stimulate the economy."
2,"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are viewing recent lower inflation readings as potentially temporary and are considering an alternative measure of inflation (the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation) that has been stable at or close to the 2% target. This suggests that they do not see a persistent downward trend in inflation that would warrant an easing of monetary policy. Instead, by acknowledging the stability of this measure of inflation, they may be inclined to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to prevent future inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that labor market conditions will self-correct over time, leading to a more balanced demand and supply, which in turn would reduce wage and price pressures. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, where the FOMC is neither signaling an immediate need to tighten monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor indicating a need to ease it (which would be dovish). Instead, the statement reflects a belief in the eventual stabilization of the labor market without explicit intervention, aligning with a neutral stance on monetary policy."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared for the January FOMC meeting, the staff's projection for the growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in the near term was revised down a bit.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a slight downward revision in the near-term GDP growth forecast but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. The FOMC may adjust policy in response to such forecasts, but the sentence itself does not convey a specific policy direction."
0,The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings in light of incoming information and is prepared to adjust those holdings as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to making adjustments to its securities holdings based on new information to support its goals of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather shows a readiness to respond to economic changes as necessary. It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction depending on how economic indicators align with their long-term objectives."
1,Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants are considering a less accommodative (i.e., tighter) monetary policy in response to high inflation pressures. This suggests a potential move towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to curb inflation and align with the FOMC's goal of price stability."
2,The downside risks from the possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer-run potential.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a balanced view of potential risks to inflation, with downside risks (such as lower inflation expectations or a stronger dollar) being roughly counterbalanced by upside risks (such as higher-than-expected inflation in an overperforming economy). This suggests that the FOMC sees equal chances of inflation moving in either direction, which does not clearly indicate a move toward tightening or easing monetary policy. The use of the term ""roughly counterbalanced"" implies a stance that is neither particularly hawkish nor dovish, but rather one of waiting and seeing how these risks evolve."
1,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee views the economy as strong and resilient, even in the face of adverse events like high energy prices and natural disasters. This implies that the FOMC sees the economy as capable of withstanding tighter monetary policy without derailing growth, which aligns with a hawkish stance that supports the possibility of interest rate increases or other forms of monetary tightening to prevent overheating and control inflation."
1,"The expansion of M2 had declined substantially since late spring, apparently in part as a result of the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from higher market interest rates and possibly also from slackening growth in household incomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the growth of the money supply (M2) has slowed down due to higher market interest rates and potentially slower growth in household incomes. Higher market interest rates typically result from a tightening of monetary policy, as the central bank raises rates to control inflation and stabilize the economy. The reference to ""widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2"" suggests that other investments are becoming more attractive compared to holding money, which is a consequence of higher interest rates. This aligns with a hawkish stance, where the central bank is likely aiming to cool down economic activity and inflationary pressures by making it more expensive to borrow money."
2,"While there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a cautious approach towards inflation, suggesting that while there is no immediate evidence of accelerating inflation, the members remain alert to the potential need for policy action to prevent such an outcome. This vigilance implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflation emerge, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
1,"A number of business contacts indicated that they were passing on at least a portion of these higher costs to their customers or that they planned to try to do so later this year; however, contacts were uncertain about the extent to which they could raise prices, given current market conditions and the cautious attitudes toward spending still held by households and businesses.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where businesses are facing higher costs and are attempting to pass these costs onto customers, but there is uncertainty about their ability to do so due to market conditions and cautious spending behaviors. This indicates that there is some inflationary pressure from higher business costs, but it is counterbalanced by the uncertainty of demand-side conditions (cautious spending). The sentence does not clearly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it reflects both inflationary concerns and potential weakness in demand. Therefore, the stance is neutral, showing a balance between the risks of inflation and the need to support demand."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a downward revision in the growth forecast for real GDP, which suggests a recognition of some economic softening, particularly in the construction sector. However, it does not directly imply an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The statement is simply an observation of economic conditions, which could be part of the normal fluctuations in economic data that the FOMC monitors. It does not clearly suggest a stance towards more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy actions."
2,these participants noted the risk that such cautious attitudes toward hiring could slow the pace at which the unemployment rate normalized.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests concern that cautious hiring attitudes could hinder the progress toward normalizing the unemployment rate. This implies a focus on supporting employment, which may lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate economic activity and job growth, rather than tightening policy."
2,"While participants viewed the downside risks to their forecasts of economic activity over the projection period as having diminished, their assessment of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the projection period was not greatly changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC participants see fewer downside risks to economic activity, their overall expectations for economic activity and inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests a steady view on the economic outlook without a clear indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
