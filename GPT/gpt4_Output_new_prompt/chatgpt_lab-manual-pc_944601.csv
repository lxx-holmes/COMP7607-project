2,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of positive economic performance in terms of growth and labor market conditions but does not directly indicate a future change in monetary policy. It suggests a balanced view without a clear bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"In fact, it’s already—it’s already understood, I think, that—that there’s more—even though we’re at 3½ percent unemployment, there’s actually more slack out there, in a sense.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite a low unemployment rate (3½ percent), there is still perceived slack in the labor market. This implies that the economy might not be overheating and there may be room for the labor market to improve without leading to inflationary pressures. Therefore, there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining current policy to encourage employment growth."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation."" suggests that while wages are increasing, the purchasing power of those wages is being offset by inflation. This statement does not clearly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges an existing condition of the economy that the FOMC might consider when making decisions, but it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the ongoing challenge of balancing between supporting employment (through wage increases) and maintaining stable prices."
2,Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests satisfaction with the current policy framework's performance, which implies a balanced approach without signaling imminent changes to the policy stance. It reflects a view that the existing measures are effectively supporting the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the decline in unemployment was not due to job creation but rather a decrease in the labor force participation rate. This suggests that the labor market may not be as tight as the unemployment rate alone would imply, which could mean there is less upward pressure on wages and inflation. Therefore, there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to cool down the economy."
0,So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the distributional effects of unemployment, noting that minorities and low-income individuals tend to experience higher rates of unemployment. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges a socioeconomic issue related to the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. It reflects the Committee's awareness of disparities in economic outcomes, which is important for understanding the broader context of employment trends, but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action."
0,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where commodity prices are falling due to weaker global demand, particularly from emerging markets and Europe. This observation is a statement of current economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on the global economic environment that could influence their decisions. The impact on the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates is not directly addressed, and the sentence does not imply a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"The persistence of that into, into inflation over time is just not there.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not persisting over time, which implies that there may be less concern about long-term inflationary pressures. This could indicate a stance that does not necessitate tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish approach that supports easing or maintaining the current policy to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate need to address high inflation."
0,"But also we want to see inflation move up back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term, and so seeing above-trend growth and continuing tightness—greater tightness in labor and product markets—I think that will help us achieve our objective as well with respect to inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a desire to see inflation return to the FOMC's 2 percent objective, suggesting that the Committee is willing to tolerate or even encourage ""above-trend growth"" and ""greater tightness in labor and product markets"" to achieve this. Tighter labor and product markets typically lead to upward pressure on wages and prices, which can be a precursor to inflation. The willingness to promote conditions that could lead to higher inflation suggests a stance that is more inclined towards tightening monetary policy to ensure that inflation reaches the target level, which is a hawkish position."
2,"So, as you know, the ultimate focus that we have is on the real economy: maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Reserve's core objectives without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reaffirms the FOMC's focus on its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability, which does not inherently suggest an imminent policy tightening or easing but rather a commitment to its overarching goals."
0,"You know, what you hear out there is that demand—you talk to banks, and they’ll say demand for loans is very, very low right now.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects an observation about current economic conditions, specifically the low demand for loans as reported by banks, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides information that could be used to assess the state of the economy. This information could be relevant to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as loan demand can be an indicator of economic activity, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"Finally, I would like to note that the Committee strives to explain its monetary policy decisions as clearly as possible, and we continue to explore ways of enhancing the clarity of our public communications.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any direct indication of future monetary policy actions such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the Committee's commitment to transparency and clear communication regarding its policy decisions. This statement is about the process of communication rather than the direction of policy, and therefore it does not suggest a stance towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy."
0,"If we think that the potential growth rate of the economy is somewhere between, somewhere around 1.75 percent, 2.8 percent is strong economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the current economic growth rate of 2.8 percent is significantly higher than the potential growth rate estimated to be around 1.75 percent. This could indicate that the economy is growing faster than its potential, which may lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such a situation might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards not tightening monetary policy (raising rates) despite low unemployment levels, unless there is a corresponding rise in inflation. This suggests a tolerance for lower unemployment without preemptive rate hikes, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes supporting employment and is less concerned with immediate inflationary pressures, as long as they remain within target levels."
0,"Monetary policy has a role, and it really is in, you know—our original role was providing liquidity to financial systems when they’re under stress, and that’s—that’s really part of what we did today.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is actively providing liquidity to financial systems under stress, which is typically a sign of a more accommodative monetary policy stance aimed at supporting the economy during times of financial strain. However, the context of ""providing liquidity"" suggests that the action is a response to financial stress rather than a general easing of policy. This can be seen as a preemptive or proactive measure to prevent further economic downturn or financial instability, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes stability and could lead to tightening once the immediate stress is alleviated."
2,"Monetary policy, maximum employment, stable prices—it’s less obvious to me.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It expresses uncertainty or a lack of clarity regarding the relationship between monetary policy, maximum employment, and stable prices. This suggests a neutral stance, as it does not commit to any particular policy action or change in direction."
1,"But, I would say, overall, we’re trying to sustain the expansion and keep, you know, close to our statutory goals, which are maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is aiming to maintain the current economic expansion and stay aligned with its statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, neither explicitly signaling an intent to tighten (which would be hawkish) nor to ease (which would be dovish). The focus is on sustaining the current economic conditions, which implies a neutral stance."
2,"You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that."" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. It simply states a principle of monetary policy being forward-looking, which is a general approach and does not indicate a current or planned stance. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL, as it does not suggest a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish position."
1,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is robust, with low unemployment and rising wages. This scenario could lead to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Strong wage gains, in particular, can contribute to inflation as businesses pass on the higher labor costs to consumers through price increases. Therefore, the statement suggests a stance that would be more inclined towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond to monetary policy actions aimed at boosting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects an understanding of the broader economic context in which monetary policy operates and suggests a balanced view on the use of different policy tools to achieve economic goals."
2,"And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of the FOMC's expression of individual committee members' thoughts on monetary policy and economic projections. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather explains the process of how the committee's thinking is reflected in their policy decisions. This statement is more about the methodology of the FOMC's decision-making process rather than a hint at future policy moves."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC believed its current monetary policy stance was appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects at the time of their meeting. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the existing policy settings in relation to the economic outlook. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
2,"I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the relationship between economic slack (unused economic capacity) and inflation is weak, implying that even if there is slack in the economy, it may not be leading to lower inflation as might be traditionally expected. This could be interpreted as a dovish stance because it implies there may be less need to tighten monetary policy aggressively if inflation is not rising significantly in response to economic slack. The FOMC might, therefore, be more inclined to maintain or reduce interest rates to support employment, given that inflation is not a pressing concern, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices"" does not directly indicate a clear stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the negative impact of higher gasoline prices, which could be inflationary (suggesting a hawkish response might be needed) or could slow economic growth (suggesting a dovish response might be needed). However, without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to these higher prices, the stance remains unclear."
2,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC takes into consideration risks to the financial system that could impede achieving its goals, which include maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a general principle of being mindful of financial stability in the context of their broader objectives. It shows a balanced approach to monitoring risks without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment."
0,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the FOMC's target of 2 percent for some time. This suggests that the Committee may be less inclined to take immediate action to tighten monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures, as they are tolerating a higher inflation rate temporarily. However, the stance is considered hawkish because it implies that the FOMC is anticipating future actions to eventually bring inflation back down to the target level, which would likely involve tightening monetary policy. The acceptance of temporarily higher inflation suggests a strategic approach to ensure that the long-term average inflation rate aligns with their goal, but it also indicates readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is a hawkish position."
2,It’s where we always want inflation to be heading.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It’s where we always want inflation to be heading"" does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. It simply expresses a general desire for inflation to move towards a target, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of price stability. Without additional context indicating whether this means inflation needs to be reduced or increased to reach the target, the stance cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an ongoing discussion about the adequacy of the unemployment rate as a measure of labor resource utilization. This suggests that the FOMC is considering various indicators to assess the labor market, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving maximum employment, one of their key goals. The sentence shows the Committee's commitment to understanding the complexities of the labor market, which is a necessary part of formulating appropriate monetary policy, but it does not reveal a specific policy direction."
2,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the resilience of banks to a significant increase in long-term interest rates, noting that higher rates can be beneficial for their net interest margin over time. This statement is more of an observation about the banking sector's condition in response to interest rate changes rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather assesses the impact of interest rate fluctuations on banks."
2,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes uncertainty among firms regarding government contracts and how this affects their employment decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the influence of nonmonetary factors on employment, which is one of the economic indicators the FOMC monitors. The statement does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding the impact of declining oil prices on emerging markets, without directly suggesting a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve. It is a statement of fact about external economic conditions rather than a policy direction or an indication of the FOMC's future actions."
2,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commentary on past predictions and outcomes regarding inflation rather than indicating a current policy stance or future policy direction. It acknowledges the variability of inflation rates and the challenges in achieving the FOMC's target but does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy."
0,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy has not achieved one of the FOMC's key goals, which is maximum employment. This suggests that there may be room for an accommodative monetary policy stance to support further job growth, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance. The implication is that the FOMC may lean towards easing or maintaining current policy measures to help achieve maximum employment, consistent with a dovish outlook."
1,"So I, you know, I’m—I feel quite comfortable that we can—in particular, that we can raise interest rates at the appropriate time, even if the balance sheet remains large for an extended period.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to raise interest rates, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. This action is typically taken to control inflation and ensure price stability, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices. The speaker's comfort with raising interest rates despite a large balance sheet suggests a focus on controlling inflation over stimulating the economy, which is a hawkish stance."
1,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a neutral observation about productivity growth, which does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an economic condition that could potentially influence the FOMC's decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest any specific policy action. Productivity growth can impact both employment and inflation, but without additional context on how the FOMC might respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral."
1,"But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy by suggesting a gradual removal of accommodation due to signs of a tight labor market. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, as a tight labor market could lead to wage growth and potential inflationary pressures, which the Committee might counteract by raising interest rates."
1,"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the banking system is currently resilient and strong, and there is no significant concern about excessive leverage or credit growth that would typically warrant a change in monetary policy. The speaker acknowledges that these factors are monitored as risks but clarifies that they are not major factors currently influencing monetary policy decisions. This suggests a balanced approach, neither indicating an immediate need to tighten (hawkish) nor ease (dovish) monetary policy."
0,"Now, members of the Committee have different views about why this is likely to be true, that the funds rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective—they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it’s likely to be the case that interest rates will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion among FOMC members about their varying perspectives on the future state of interest rates relative to the normalization of the labor market and the achievement of the inflation objective. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges differing views on the interest rate outlook once economic goals are met. The focus on the potential for lower interest rates in the context of a normalized labor market and achieved inflation target suggests a balanced approach to policy, without a clear lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"And, at a high level, yes, I would say, and I’ve said before, that it’s really fiscal policy that is more powerful and that has much more to do with—fiscal policy can do those things that will increase the longer-run growth rate of the United States by improving productivity and labor force September 18, 2019 participation and the skills and aptitudes of workers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relative power of fiscal policy in influencing long-term growth, productivity, and labor force participation, rather than directly commenting on the current or future stance of monetary policy. It neither explicitly suggests a need to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the role of fiscal measures in economic development."
2,"When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt.","NEUTRAL

The sentence seems to reflect a general statement about the economic forecast, suggesting that over time, both supply and demand sides of the economy will adjust to changes. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the dynamic nature of economic conditions that the FOMC must consider in its policy decisions. The sentence does not provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates, nor does it suggest any immediate action or change in policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a significant drop in unemployment, inflation has not increased as might be expected. This suggests that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is weaker than previously thought, which could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation. The Committee members adjusting their estimates downward reflects a stance that is more accommodative or 'dovish,' as it suggests they are less concerned about inflationary pressures from low unemployment and therefore may not see the need for immediate policy tightening."
1,"Well, our policy approach doesn’t involve intentionally trying to raise inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is not actively seeking to increase inflation, which suggests that they are neither looking to tighten nor ease monetary policy specifically to affect inflation levels. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices without explicitly indicating a shift towards more aggressive inflationary or anti-inflationary measures."
1,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is becoming more widespread across services, which suggests rising inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflation and achieve the target rate of 2% over the long term. A broad spread of inflation typically prompts a hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating and to maintain price stability."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not widespread across the economy, which implies that the inflationary pressures are contained or sector-specific. This could indicate that there may be less need for aggressive tightening of monetary policy, as the inflation does not appear to be a broad-based issue that would typically warrant a hawkish response. The FOMC might interpret this as a sign that they can maintain or ease their policy stance, rather than tighten it, to achieve their goals of maximum employment and stable prices without inducing unnecessary constraints on the economy."
2,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the inherent volatility in inflation measures without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy, but rather an acceptance of the fluctuating nature of inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's understanding that economic indicators can be variable."
0,"But, first, on inflation expectations, it is true that the breakevens from the inflation-adjusted—inflation-indexed bonds have come down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations, as measured by the breakevens from inflation-indexed bonds, have decreased. This could suggest that the market anticipates lower inflation in the future, which might be a result of previous tightening measures by the FOMC or expectations of future tightening. A decline in inflation expectations could provide the FOMC with more room to continue or maintain a hawkish stance to ensure that inflation moves towards the Committee's 2% target."
2,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates."" does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It merely indicates that the speaker is about to address a topic related to exchange rates, without offering any insight into policy direction or economic outlook. Therefore, it is classified as neutral."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy"" suggests a stance in favor of maintaining an accommodative monetary policy to support economic activity. This implies that the speaker believes the economy may still need support to achieve maximum employment and stable prices, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes stimulating economic growth and employment over combating potential inflationary pressures."
2,That’s probably related to gas prices and also just stock prices to some extent for other people.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a neutral observation about the factors influencing economic conditions, specifically mentioning gas and stock prices. It does not directly suggest a policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges external factors that can affect inflation and economic stability, which are elements the FOMC monitors. The statement does not indicate a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"You know, it’s interest rates, it’s risk spreads, it’s currency, it’s the stock market, it’s credit availability, it’s many, many factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence lists various factors that influence the economy and monetary policy decisions, such as interest rates, risk spreads, currency, the stock market, and credit availability. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather acknowledges the complexity of the economic environment that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. This reflects a balanced view without a clear bias toward either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"The Committee, based on its assessment at each meeting, has felt comfortable saying that, based on its assessment of those factors, it considers that it will be likely appropriate to maintain the current target range for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if inflation remains below the 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is inclined to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a significant period after the end of the asset purchase program, particularly if inflation continues to run below the 2 percent target. This suggests a stance towards easing or at least not tightening monetary policy, as they are signaling a willingness to keep rates low to support economic activity and boost inflation towards their objective. This is consistent with a dovish approach, which is generally characterized by policies that support growth and employment, even at the risk of higher inflation."
0,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is maintaining a stance of monetary easing, as it continues with ""highly accommodative policies"" in response to elevated unemployment and inflation rates that are below the Committee's target. This suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing support for the labor market and is not concerned about inflationary pressures at the moment, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"So it’s a serious economic problem for the United States, but it’s—it’s got underlying causes that are not related to monetary policy or to our response to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economic problem mentioned is serious but also states that its underlying causes are not related to monetary policy or the response to the pandemic. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a role for monetary policy to address this specific issue, as it falls outside the scope of their typical tools or influence. The stance is neither explicitly suggesting a tightening nor an easing of policy, but rather a recognition of limitations in the influence of monetary policy on certain economic problems."
0,"These headwinds—which include developments abroad, subdued household formation, and meager productivity growth—could persist for some time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various economic challenges that could have a lasting impact, but it does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges factors that might influence the economy but does not suggest an immediate response in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of ""headwinds"" such as international developments, low household formation, and poor productivity growth points to concerns that could affect the economic outlook, but without an explicit link to policy actions, the stance remains neutral."
1,"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a view that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect a tightening labor market, suggesting that the FOMC members are not convinced that the economy is overheating or that there is a need to tighten policy aggressively. However, it also does not clearly suggest that there is a need for easing. The statement reflects a balanced view that is neither clearly hawkish nor dovish, as it expresses uncertainty about the interpretation of labor market indicators."
1,"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation expectations to ensure they do not become unanchored, which suggests a concern for rising inflation. By emphasizing the importance of keeping inflation expectations in check, the FOMC is signaling its readiness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the central bank is vigilant against inflation and may raise interest rates or take other measures to prevent it from accelerating."
0,And I’ll discuss the thinking behind today’s interest rate reduction and then turn to the path forward.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to reduce interest rates, which is typically a dovish action. Lowering interest rates is a form of monetary policy easing intended to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, thereby supporting the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices when the economy is showing signs of slowing down or when inflation is below the target level."
0,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that both monetary and fiscal policies should be used to stimulate growth, suggesting an inclination towards an easier monetary policy stance to support economic expansion. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of supporting maximum employment, as stimulating growth typically involves measures that make monetary conditions more accommodative to boost economic activity and employment."
2,And one reason for that is that long-term interest rates generally embody two factors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It simply states a fact about the nature of long-term interest rates without indicating a direction for monetary policy adjustments. The sentence would need to elaborate on what those two factors are and how they relate to the current economic conditions to infer a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker is comfortable with a tight labor market despite inflation being below the 2% target. This implies a tolerance for potentially stimulative conditions in the labor market without the immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, as the current inflation rate is below the FOMC's long-term goal. This stance is indicative of a dovish approach, where the focus may be more on supporting employment rather than preemptively fighting inflation."
0,"Inflation has declined further below our longer-run objective, largely reflecting the lower energy prices I just mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term goal, which is primarily attributed to a decrease in energy prices. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since inflation is not a current concern, and there may be room for easing to bring inflation closer to the target level."
2,"I’m more concerned about that than about the possibility, which exists, of higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a greater concern for the risk of higher inflation than other potential economic issues. This suggests a bias towards tightening monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to higher inflation to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
0,"And I can only say qualitatively that the Committee will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives, and, in particular, whether the recovery is still continuing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is in a monitoring phase, observing economic indicators such as unemployment and the overall recovery to assess progress towards their objectives. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a continued evaluation of economic conditions to determine future actions. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving maximum employment and stable prices without committing to a specific policy direction at this time."
