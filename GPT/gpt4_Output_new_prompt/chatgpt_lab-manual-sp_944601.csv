2,Does the rapid growth in cross-border capital flows limit or even eliminate the ability of domestic monetary policy to affect domestic interest rates?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the effectiveness of domestic monetary policy in the context of global financial flows. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather considers the potential challenges that globalization might pose to the traditional mechanisms of monetary policy. The focus is on the transmission of policy through domestic interest rates and how this might be influenced by international capital movements, which is a neutral inquiry into the functioning of policy rather than a signal of any particular policy direction."
2,The September FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved in August our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3 The changes we made in our September FOMC statement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural update to align the FOMC's policy guidance with a new framework established in their Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an administrative adjustment to ensure consistency in their approach. The sentence does not provide information on the direction of policy changes, such as raising or lowering interest rates, or other measures that would suggest a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,But the advent of the war has led to a significant hit to real incomes from large price increases in energy and other commodities in some of the most severely affected economies.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the war has caused a substantial increase in energy and commodity prices, which negatively impacts real incomes. This situation suggests rising inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its stable prices goal, thus reflecting a hawkish stance."
2,But speculators rarely succeed in dislodging an exchange rate that is firmly rooted in compatible policies and cost structures.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the resilience of exchange rates that are supported by compatible policies and cost structures, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It reflects a general observation on currency markets rather than a specific policy direction related to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on discussing empirical evidence regarding the impact of asset price changes on consumption and investment, which is an analytical exercise rather than a direct indication of a policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Accordingly, while the weight of current economic output is probably only modestly higher than it was a half century ago, value added, adjusted for price change, has risen well over threefold.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic growth over a long period (half a century), noting that while the physical weight of economic output has not increased significantly, the value added (presumably to the economy), adjusted for inflation, has increased substantially. This statement is a factual assessment of economic growth and does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or signal an intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It does not explicitly relate to the immediate goals of maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any immediate policy actions."
1,"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) assessment of the neutral level of the federal funds rate and its implications for monetary policy. It acknowledges a lower neutral rate compared to historical averages and the potential constraints posed by the effective lower bound (ELB). The statement also recognizes the associated risks to inflation and employment. This is a factual assessment of the monetary policy environment rather than a direct indication of a future policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather points out the considerations the Committee must take into account when implementing its strategy."
1,"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that past actions to reduce inflation involved deliberately slowing down economic activity, which can be associated with a tightening of monetary policy. It suggests a willingness to endure short-term economic pain for the long-term benefit of maintaining low inflation and monetary credibility, indicating a hawkish stance on monetary policy."
2,* * * What then are the implications of this largely irreducible uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about how uncertainty affects the conduct of monetary policy, without providing a clear direction towards tightening or easing. It reflects a contemplative stance, considering the impact of uncertainty on policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach that neither explicitly supports a hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing) policy action. The focus on ""irreducible uncertainty"" suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging the inherent unpredictability in economic conditions, which is a neutral position in terms of policy implications."
2,"As is evident in the right-hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the relationship between growth differentials and capital inflows to Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the Federal Reserve is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions."
2,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the methodology for understanding long-term interest rates and the factors that influence them, such as market expectations and term premiums. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains components that factor into long-term rate expectations, including the risk of future inflation. This is more of a technical assessment of economic conditions and does not signal a clear policy direction."
2,"Flexible inflation averaging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule, but it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method of approaching inflation targeting, suggesting that flexible inflation averaging might offer benefits in terms of robustness and simplicity. It does not directly indicate an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather discusses a strategy for achieving the long-term inflation goal. This approach could be used in various economic conditions and does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a commitment to long-run price stability is crucial to maintain confidence in dollar-denominated assets and to prevent a decline in the dollar's value, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the Federal Reserve may need to maintain or tighten monetary policy to ensure this stability and prevent inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is considering the effects of climate change and associated policies as factors in its decision-making process to achieve its dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges an additional consideration in their policy framework. It reflects a balanced approach to incorporating new information and potential risks into their policy assessments without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"By the same token, the effect of the interest rate channel on overall economic activity may be diminished by greater trade integration as changes in domestic demand are offset by induced changes in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the impact of interest rate adjustments on the economy might be lessened due to increased trade integration. This implies that changes in the domestic demand resulting from interest rate changes could be balanced out by corresponding changes in imports. The statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a factor that could influence the effectiveness of such policies. It reflects an analysis of the economic environment and how external factors, like trade integration, can affect the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy."
0,"Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the current disinflationary trends might not continue and could reverse, leading to higher inflation in the future. This suggests that the FOMC might need to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent a potential increase in inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on controlling inflation even if it is not an immediate concern."
2,"Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity"" is a statement of economic principle rather than a direct indication of current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the relationship between labor compensation and productivity, which is a factor the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions to achieve its long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,This aggregate growth-accounting framework forms the economic underpinning of key comprehensive productivity statistics produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a framework used for producing productivity statistics and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a factual statement about the methodology behind economic data without any clear implications for future monetary policy actions."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an opinion held by a group of economists regarding the relationship between monetary policy and financial market bubbles, but it does not directly indicate a current stance of the FOMC towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement about a viewpoint rather than a description of policy action or intent."
2,"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a general belief in the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policies in achieving noninflationary economic growth, which aligns with the FOMC's long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, it does not directly indicate any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of focusing on long-run goals, suggesting a balanced approach to policy-making."
1,"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation pressures become excessive or if inflation expectations rise above the target level. This stance aligns with a commitment to maintaining stable prices, one of the FOMC's primary goals, and suggests potential action to increase interest rates or otherwise reduce monetary accommodation to prevent high inflation."
2,"Reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and demand for these liabilitiesâ€”notably, currency in circulationâ€”grows over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual aspect of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet mechanics, specifically the growth in demand for liabilities such as currency in circulation. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's future policy actions. It simply states that reserve balances and currency in circulation, which are liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet, tend to grow over time. This growth is a neutral observation and does not inherently suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the fall bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an alignment of policy guidance with a new framework and a change in language from ""deviations"" to ""shortfalls"" regarding employment. This does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a methodological update in how the FOMC will assess and communicate its employment goals. The focus on ""shortfalls"" suggests a commitment to addressing unemployment more aggressively, but without specific policy actions mentioned, the stance remains neutral."
2,"There is, in my view, a reasonable prospect that each of these two effects will reverse their contributions to inflation over the next couple of years and that balance between them will be important in determining the pattern of core and overall inflation rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the factors contributing to inflation will reverse in the coming years, which suggests a wait-and-see approach. It does not explicitly advocate for immediate tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather points to a balanced view of future inflation dynamics. The focus on the balance between factors affecting inflation reflects a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be neither particularly concerned about high inflation that would warrant a hawkish response, nor signaling a need for dovish measures to stimulate the economy."
2,"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the potential effects of globalization on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, without indicating a specific direction of policy adjustment. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather poses a question about the broader impacts of globalization. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not directly relate to immediate policy actions but rather to an understanding of economic dynamics that could inform future decisions."
1,"But, again underscoring an earlier point, this tightness of the labor market has not manifested itself in ongoing escalation of wage inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the labor market is tight, it has not led to a continuous increase in wage inflation. This suggests that the current state of the labor market is not creating upward pressure on inflation that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. However, it also does not indicate a need for easing, as it does not point to a weakening labor market or deflationary pressures. The statement is simply observing a current economic condition without signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
0,"Thus, avoiding a further substantial fall in inflation should be a priority of monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about preventing a significant drop in inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might prioritize actions to keep inflation from falling too low. This could imply a tightening of monetary policy to maintain or increase inflation towards the target level, consistent with a hawkish stance that aims to prevent deflationary pressures."
1,"More recently, with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that while inflation is under control, there is a concern about ""financial excess,"" which often refers to situations where asset prices are inflated beyond their fundamental values, potentially leading to bubbles. A hawkish stance would be concerned with such excesses and might imply a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to mitigate financial stability risks. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and moderating long-term interest rates, as financial excess can lead to instability in these areas."
2,"Fischer, Sahay, and Vegh (2002) present evidence of a strong correlation between fiscal deficits and money creation in high-inflation economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about research findings regarding the relationship between fiscal deficits and money creation in high-inflation economies. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in monetary policy. The sentence does not imply a tightening or easing of policy but rather provides context on economic phenomena that may be considered in the broader analysis of monetary policy decisions."
0,And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.,"HAWKISH

The sentence reflects on the high costs of achieving low inflation in the past, which involved significant tightening of monetary policy through high interest rates and the resulting high unemployment. This historical context suggests a willingness to endure short-term economic pain for long-term stability in prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation, even at the potential cost of higher unemployment and interest rates."
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target for some time following periods when it has been persistently below that level. This suggests a stance that is more accommodative or 'dovish,' as it implies a tolerance for higher inflation and potentially a slower pace of monetary policy tightening, or even easing, to support the economy and bring inflation back to the target average."
2,"For example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to factories after the Civil War led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to operate the new machines.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical shift in the labor market demand due to changes in manufacturing production methods. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of tightening or easing. The sentence is more reflective of an economic observation from the past rather than a present monetary policy direction."
0,"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the observation of productivity growth in the United States compared to other advanced countries, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy based on the information provided. The focus on productivity growth is more of an economic assessment than a direct indicator of future policy moves."
2,"Although your papers concentrate on the equity premium, I would like to take a few minutes today to broaden the discussion to encompass risk premiums in other markets and to highlight the connections between risk premiums and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a broader discussion on the relationship between risk premiums in various markets and monetary policy, which is an analytical perspective rather than a policy direction."
2,"With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus crop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a regional economic update, which is a common part of FOMC discussions as they assess various sectors and regions to get a comprehensive view of the national economy. Discussing Florida's citrus crop, tourism, and real estate prices does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy but rather provides context for the FOMC's overall assessment. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"In particular, the Committee noted that it would respond as necessary to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining price stability, which often involves tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This suggests that the Committee is prepared to take action, potentially including raising interest rates, to ensure that inflation does not exceed their target, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"Rapid responses by businesses to changes in free-market prices have muted much of the tendency for unsold goods to back up, or unmet needs to produce shortages.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the efficiency of businesses in adjusting to price changes, which helps to prevent the buildup of unsold goods or the emergence of shortages. This observation is a neutral statement regarding the state of the economy and does not directly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply reflects the dynamic nature of the market and the ability of businesses to adapt, which is a desirable characteristic but does not in itself suggest a particular policy stance."
1,"Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve's efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's policy framework in achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability over the past eight years, up until the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of past performance. The mention of the longest economic expansion suggests that the policies were effective in maintaining the dual mandate, but it does not signal a future policy direction."
2,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is speculative and does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It poses a question about the potential impact of a certain action on the conduct of monetary policy, without providing information on what that action might be or suggesting a preference for a more hawkish or dovish approach. It reflects a neutral stance, focusing on the consideration of policy effectiveness rather than signaling a change in policy direction."
1,"A European Central Bank analysis concluded that the release of capital buffers increased headroom for banks relative to not only their regulatory thresholds, but also their internal risk controls, and enabled banks to continue providing credit to households and businesses.6 And of course, monetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment, which suggests that the monetary policy is leaning towards tightening measures to combat inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a priority on controlling inflation, potentially through higher interest rates or other contractionary policies."
2,"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of policymakers updating their estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the output gap, which are key indicators for assessing economic conditions. This statement does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather focuses on the importance of informed decision-making based on economic data. It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators to maintain the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of global factors on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as the improved resilience of the financial system due to better risk management and stronger regulation. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the current economic and financial conditions. The mention of stronger financial institutions suggests a stable environment, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not signal a clear move in policy stance."
2,The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general confidence in the current policy framework's ability to handle economic challenges, suggesting that the FOMC believes its existing strategy is appropriate for the current economic conditions. This statement is more about the adequacy of their policy tools and approach rather than a signal of imminent policy action."
2,"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a hypothetical scenario where the economy is assumed to be at an ideal state, with full employment and inflation at target levels. It does not indicate any particular action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather sets a baseline for discussion or analysis."
2,"May 13, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Governor Christopher J. Waller At The Global Interdependence Center's 39th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, The LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, George and the Global Interdependence Center, for the invitation to speak to you this afternoon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is a formal introductory remark expressing gratitude for the invitation to speak at an event. It does not contain any information about the stance of monetary policy, such as indications of tightening or easing, nor does it discuss the economic outlook or monetary policy actions. Therefore, it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
1,"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distributionâ€”for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes ongoing supply chain issues, including production bottlenecks, input shortages, poor crop yields, and transportation challenges, which are contributing to rising prices. This indicates inflationary pressures that the FOMC might address by tightening monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices. The mention of driving up prices suggests that the FOMC may consider actions to counteract inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of fiscal policy in influencing economic growth through various means such as affecting national saving, incentivizing work, saving, investment, and public investment in human and physical capital. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather discusses the impact of fiscal policy measures, which are separate from the monetary policy tools the FOMC directly controls. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future monetary policy actions, such as adjustments to the federal funds rate, which would be necessary to classify it as hawkish or dovish."
2,"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the technical aspects of how the FOMC might use certain economic indicators (unemployment gap vs. output gap) and coefficients in policy rules to guide their decision-making process. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the methodology and considerations involved in policy formulation. The mention of choosing coefficients and other choices to be made suggests a focus on the analytical framework rather than a clear policy direction."
2,"Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between various interest rates and asset prices and their effects on the cost of borrowing and aggregate demand. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it simply states an economic observation that changes in rates and prices can affect borrowing costs and demand, which is a neutral statement regarding policy stance."
1,"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the negative impact of higher inflation on economic growth in the longer term. This suggests that the FOMC might favor tightening monetary policy to control inflation and prevent it from harming long-term growth, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
0,"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to continue purchasing assets at a significant pace until there is considerable progress towards the goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests that the FOMC is actively engaging in expansionary monetary policy to support the economy, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. However, the use of ""until substantial further progress has been made"" implies that the FOMC is setting a condition for when it will scale back or cease these purchases. This conditionality suggests a forward-looking approach to tightening monetary policy once certain economic benchmarks are met, which is a hawkish signal. The hawkish aspect is the indication that the FOMC is prepared to reduce accommodation in the future as goals are approached, reflecting a readiness to tighten policy to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check."
2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions where the stock market is performing well, and core inflation is moderating. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather reports on economic phenomena. The FOMC might view the moderation in core inflation as a positive development towards their inflation target, while a soaring stock market could reflect investor confidence. However, without a clear indication of how the FOMC plans to respond to these conditions, the sentence itself remains neutral."
1,But that forecast for growth and uncertainty about the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation next year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential higher inflation due to growth forecasts and unresolved supply constraints, suggesting that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an inflationary overshoot, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for efficient resource allocation and achieving maximum sustainable employment. This suggests a focus on controlling inflation, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The statement aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a willingness to prioritize inflation control, potentially through higher interest rates or other contractionary measures, to maintain long-term economic health."
0,"Profit margins have been running a little higher this year than last, aided importantly by strong growth in labor productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that profit margins have increased due to strong growth in labor productivity, which is a positive economic indicator but does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. The improvement in labor productivity could be seen as reducing inflationary pressures (which might be dovish), but the fact that it is aiding profit margins does not inherently signal a need for policy adjustment. It is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stances."
2,Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on setting the stage for a discussion on productivity and technology developments and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a neutral statement that does not provide information on the direction of future policy but rather introduces a topic for further elaboration."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the 2% long-term target by a significant margin (at or above 3%). The speaker's readiness to consider this situation as more than a ""moderate"" overshoot suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there are currently significant imbalances in the economy, including in the labor market, the expectation is that these will resolve over time without leading to persistent inflationary pressures. This indicates a belief in the self-correcting nature of the economy and does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement reflects a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation but is not yet committing to a change in policy in response to these imbalances."
2,"Operating Strategies and the FOMC Meeting Now that we appreciate the challenging nature of monetary policy, we are ready to develop a strategy for implementing open market operations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the process of developing a strategy for implementing open market operations, which is a technical aspect of how the FOMC conducts monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather discusses the preparation for action. The sentence reflects a commitment to planning and does not reveal any specific direction in terms of future policy moves."
2,"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the forecasting process and the need for consistency across various economic variables in the staff's overall economic view. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a procedural aspect of how economic forecasts are made to align with the FOMC's understanding of the economy. This is a part of the Committee's approach to making informed decisions but does not in itself suggest a change in policy direction."
2,Confirming that variations in growth rates of liquidity (especially unusual changes in liquidity growth that could be called excessive) systematically lead to wide swings in real asset prices requires further theoretical investigation and more empirical support.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests that more research is needed to understand the relationship between liquidity growth rates and asset price volatility. This reflects a neutral, fact-finding approach rather than an immediate policy inclination."
1,"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to reducing monetary accommodation and a decisive response to data with the aim of controlling inflation. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to achieve the FOMC's inflation targets, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the history of the European Central Bank (ECB) and does not provide any indication of the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy, nor does it offer insight into the current economic conditions or the FOMC's policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Turning now to monetary policy, at both its July and September meetings, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.3 With these decisions, the current target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75 to 2 percent, which compares with the range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent that prevailed between December 2018 and July 2019.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate, which is a move typically associated with an easing of monetary policy. Lowering interest rates is a dovish action aimed at stimulating economic activity, often in response to concerns about economic growth or below-target inflation. This action aligns with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if there are signs that the economy is not overheating and inflation is not a current concern."
2,"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of housing price trends in various economies and the central banks' focus on asset prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the behavior of housing markets in response to central banks' attention to asset prices, without suggesting a specific policy action or change."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand and contain inflationary pressures. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and is consistent with a hawkish stance, which typically involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from rising too quickly."
2,"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between stock prices and home sales, noting their correlation and the influence of interest rates on both. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how certain economic indicators might interact with each other, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC would consider when making policy decisions."
0,The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where increased productivity and rising corporate profits led to a significant increase in equity prices. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis of past economic factors that influenced market conditions."
1,"Nonetheless, the leveling off in that disturbing trend is an encouraging sign of what we can achieve if we can maintain strong and flexible labor markets accompanied by low inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on the current economic situation, where strong and flexible labor markets are seen alongside low inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects satisfaction with the current state of economic indicators. The use of ""encouraging sign"" suggests that the current policies might be effective, and the Committee may continue to monitor the situation without indicating a clear direction for future policy changes."
0,Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Accelerating productivity poses a significant complication for economic forecasting"" is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate a preference for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a factor (productivity growth) that can impact economic forecasting and, by extension, monetary policy decision-making. Higher productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily increasing inflation, which could be seen as neither hawkish nor dovish but rather a complex element to consider in the broader economic context."
1,"For example, as table 1 shows, the collective current account surplus of the Middle East and Africa rose more than $40 billion between 1996 and 2003; it continued to swell in 2004 as oil prices increased yet further.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic observation related to the collective current account surplus of the Middle East and Africa and its correlation with oil prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. Instead, it provides context on external economic factors that could influence global financial conditions, which the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any specific monetary policy action."
0,"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that as price stability is achieved or deflation occurs, the resistance to nominal wage cuts could lead to higher real wages, which might result in a higher equilibrium level of unemployment. This implies a potential risk of deflationary pressure leading to economic underperformance, which the FOMC might counter with a tighter monetary policy to prevent deflation and support employment, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"In addition, U.S. inflation remains muted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. inflation is not accelerating, which suggests that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply a stance that is more accommodative or leaning towards easing to support economic activity, as there is no immediate inflationary pressure that needs to be curbed."
1,"During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the inflation rate would be higher than the long-term target, suggesting that there may be a need for tightening monetary policy to bring inflation back down to the desired level. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. The reference to exceeding the target rate implies a concern for rising inflation, which is typically addressed by a hawkish stance."
0,"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term implications of increases in productivity growth rates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a factor (productivity growth) that can influence the economy and thus indirectly affect the FOMC's decisions. Higher productivity growth can lead to non-inflationary economic growth, which is generally positive for achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without necessarily prompting a change in the current monetary policy stance."
0,The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a projection about global economic growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It provides context on the economic environment but does not suggest any specific monetary policy actions."
2,I think it would be naive to assume that circumstances would not arise in which the central bank faced short-term choices between inflation stability and economic or financial stability.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the potential conflict between maintaining inflation stability and ensuring economic or financial stability, which may require different policy responses. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects the complexity and balancing act involved in the FOMC's decision-making process. The statement is neutral as it does not commit to a specific policy action but recognizes the challenges the central bank might face in achieving its goals."
2,"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern about financial imbalances potentially becoming more closely associated with the business cycle due to a combination of a low neutral interest rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation. The call to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle implies a recognition of the limits of monetary policy in this context and a potential readiness to tighten monetary policy if needed to prevent such imbalances, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on maintaining stability even if it means tightening."
1,"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly if there is a risk of inflationary pressures, indicating a stance towards preventing inflation rather than promoting easier monetary conditions. This aligns with a hawkish approach, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating the economy."
2,"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the flexibility of a central bank's approach to pursuing price stability in varying circumstances, contrasting it with a central bank that operates under a strict numerical target. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the adaptability of policy frameworks. This reflects a balanced view on how a central bank might respond to economic changes while pursuing its goals."
2,"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.","NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the importance of addressing educational and skill gaps among the youth and workforce to adapt to changing workplace demands. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather emphasizes structural issues in the economy that are typically addressed through non-monetary policy measures. The FOMC's mention of these issues reflects an awareness of the broader economic challenges that can impact their long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not suggest an immediate monetary policy action."
1,Treasury yields rose sharply on its release as market participants traced out the report's presumed implications for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market reaction to a report and the presumed implications for monetary policy, but it does not directly indicate a stance of the Federal Reserve itself. It simply states that Treasury yields rose sharply, which could be due to a variety of reasons and does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. The sentence does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards raising rates (hawkish), lowering them (dovish), or keeping them the same (neutral). It merely reflects the market's interpretation at that moment."
2,"However, the fact that most other industrial countries did not experience the same increase in productivity growth as the United States during that period, even as they became more open to trade, suggests that the relationship between productivity and trade may be complex.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the complexity of the relationship between productivity and trade, comparing the United States with other industrial countries. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide clear guidance on future policy actions. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic conditions, which is a part of the broader context the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
0,"As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement describing the impact of the pandemic on the economy, without directly indicating a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply sets the context for the economic conditions that the FOMC is considering in its policy decisions."
1,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework we adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 FOMC meeting.3 In our new framework, we aim for inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) adherence to a framework that targets inflation outcomes aligned with their long-term goal of a 2% inflation rate. It does not explicitly indicate a current policy shift towards tightening or easing but rather reaffirms their strategy to maintain inflation expectations. This suggests a commitment to a consistent policy approach rather than a change in stance."
2,"In my comments today, I will focus on the Fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it emphasizes the Fed's commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability in the face of economic upheaval. The mention of learning from history and focusing on incoming data suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where decisions will be based on the evolving economic conditions and risks, rather than a predetermined path towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"As U.S. business investment has recently begun a cyclical recovery while residential investment has remained strong, the domestic saving shortfall has continued to widen, implying a rise in the current account deficit and increasing dependence of the United States on capital inflows.9 According to the story I have sketched thus far, events outside U.S. borders--such as the financial crises that induced emerging-market countries to switch from being international borrowers to international lenders--have played an important role in the evolution of the U.S. current account deficit, with transmission occurring primarily through endogenous changes in equity values, house prices, real interest rates, and the exchange value of the dollar.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of U.S. business and residential investment, the domestic saving shortfall, and the current account deficit, as well as the role of international events in these economic developments. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an overview of economic conditions and external influences. The focus on investment trends and capital flows suggests an analysis of the economic situation without a clear policy direction, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"LBOs, and other forms of private equity investment, may force management to implement strategic changes rapidly to restore the firmâ€™s return on equity and boost share prices, in part by increasing financial leverage.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and private equity investment on firm management strategies, including the use of financial leverage to improve return on equity and share prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it describes a market dynamic related to corporate finance and investment behavior, which is not directly related to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions."
0,"Although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, it seems natural to expect, as others have argued, that these developments would have exerted some downward pressure on inflation in the United States.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that certain developments are expected to exert downward pressure on inflation in the United States. This implies that inflationary pressures are being contained or reduced, which could lead to a more accommodative or easing monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, as there may be less need for tightening to control inflation. The statement aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a situation where the FOMC might not feel the need to raise interest rates aggressively to combat high inflation."
0,"Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights a significant shortfall in employment relative to pre-pandemic levels, which suggests that the economy is not operating at full capacity. This could imply that there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so, in order to support job creation and help achieve the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. There is no indication in the sentence of a need to tighten policy to combat inflation, which would be a hawkish stance. Instead, the focus on employment shortfall aligns with a dovish stance, which is supportive of easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and employment."
2,"For all these conceptual uncertainties and measurement problems, a specific numerical inflation target would represent an unhelpful and false precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses skepticism about the usefulness of a specific numerical inflation target due to uncertainties and measurement issues. It does not directly indicate a preference for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather questions the precision of targeting a specific inflation number. This stance is neutral as it neither commits to action to combat inflation (hawkish) nor suggests a need for more accommodative policy to boost inflation or employment (dovish). It reflects a balanced view on the challenges of setting and achieving precise policy targets."
1,Another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding non-industrialized nations and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the impact of oil prices on the current-account balance of these nations, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy stances. It does not provide information on how the FOMC might adjust the federal funds rate or alter its monetary policy in response to this observation."
0,Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by mid-2003.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical assessment stating that the goal of price stability had been achieved in the past, according to most analysts. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy at the present time or in the future. Instead, it simply provides a retrospective observation about the state of price stability at a specific point in time."
1,Funding of our current account deficit likely will become more difficult when home bias approaches its practical minimum.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concerns about the challenges in funding the current account deficit, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to attract more foreign capital or to reduce the deficit. This stance is often associated with measures to ensure financial stability and could involve higher interest rates or other forms of monetary tightening to address potential imbalances."
2,"To provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, I draw your attention to a speech that Chairman Greenspan made earlier this year, entitled ""Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy"" (Greenspan, 2004).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is referencing a speech by former Chairman Greenspan on the topics of risk and uncertainty in monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions such as tightening or easing. Instead, it seems to be setting the stage for a discussion or providing context, rather than signaling a clear policy direction."
2,An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a viewpoint on the nature of asset bubbles and market rationality, rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather reflects a theoretical perspective on market behavior. This statement does not provide clear insights into the FOMC's actions regarding interest rates, employment, or inflation targets."
0,"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.","HAWKISH

The sentence describes the effects of an ""unanticipated monetary ease,"" which typically means a loosening of monetary policy. However, the context in which this is presented suggests that it is not the current stance but rather a theoretical scenario from the Mundell-Fleming model. The implication is that such a policy move would lead to lower interest rates and stimulate net exports, which could be inflationary if the economy is near or at full employment. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a HAWKISH stance because it implies that avoiding unanticipated monetary ease (or tightening monetary policy) would prevent a drop in the currency's value and guard against potential inflationary pressures, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a practice of gathering information and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that the presidents' reports include anecdotal evidence to inform the FOMC about current economic conditions in different regions. This practice is part of the Committee's information-gathering process and does not inherently suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the Employment Cost Index (ECI) growth rate without suggesting a specific policy action or direction. The ECI is a measure of wage inflation and benefits, and the statement could be interpreted in various ways depending on the broader economic context. It does not inherently suggest that the FOMC should either raise or lower interest rates or take other actions to adjust monetary policy."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a defensive stance regarding the FOMC's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices. It does not directly indicate a future direction for monetary policy but rather addresses the perception of the Committee's focus. The statement suggests that the FOMC considers both inflation and employment in its policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to its mandate."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations to prevent them from causing instability but does not indicate a current policy direction or change. It is a general statement on monetary policy principles rather than a specific policy stance."
2,"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.2 Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC has made ""important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases,"" which suggests a proactive stance in adjusting policy tools to align with their new framework. The use of the word ""upgraded"" implies a strengthening or tightening of policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. This could mean that the FOMC is signaling a potential increase in the federal funds rate or a change in asset purchases to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability, particularly if the new framework is designed to preemptively address inflationary pressures or economic overheating."
2,"Thus, knowing where productivity growth is headed is, in many respects, equivalent to foreseeing our economic destinies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general statement about the importance of productivity growth for economic outcomes. It suggests that productivity growth is a key determinant of economic performance, which is relevant for the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself signal a specific policy direction."
2,"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is a high level of uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, particularly concerning inflation and employment, as the world economy reopens after a disruptive event (likely the COVID-19 pandemic). This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity and unpredictability of the current economic environment. The FOMC is signaling that it is monitoring the situation closely and is prepared to adjust policy as needed, but it is not committing to a specific direction at this time."
0,"But low rates are not solely or even primarily a result of the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market's expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced economies.7 Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that low interest rates are a result of market expectations of low inflation and economic weakness, rather than solely due to the Federal Reserve's accommodative policies. This suggests that the economic conditions are such that there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not a current concern and the economic recovery is still fragile. The mention of low nominal returns across all asset classes reinforces the view that the economy is not overheating, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports continued monetary accommodation to aid the economic recovery."
2,"In the simplest version of his model, Bill assumed that the central bank could choose to specify its monetary policy actions in terms of a particular level of a monetary aggregate or a particular value of a short-term nominal interest rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical model of how a central bank might approach its monetary policy actions, either by targeting a monetary aggregate or setting a short-term nominal interest rate. It does not indicate a current policy stance or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is simply an explanation of policy tools without any indication of how they might be used in the current economic context."
1,"Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of inflation on different income groups, particularly highlighting the challenges faced by lower- and moderate-income individuals. It does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the social and economic effects of inflation, which is a concern for the FOMC, but does not suggest a specific policy response."
1,"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a modest increase in inflation, but it also acknowledges that this is from a very low rate, suggesting that the inflation level is not far from the target. The use of ""modest"" and the context of a ""very low rate"" imply that the situation is not prompting a strong response in either direction (neither aggressive tightening nor easing). The statement seems to be simply providing an assessment of the inflation outlook without indicating a clear direction for policy change."
2,Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of experienced loan officers in effectively distributing loans to stimulate wealth and growth in the local economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it focuses on the functioning of credit markets and the potential positive impact of skilled loan officers on economic growth, which is more related to the banking sector's operations rather than the central bank's monetary policy actions."
0,"In 2019, sluggish growth abroad and global developments weighed on investment, exports, and manufacturing in the United States, although there are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic conditions of the past, noting both negative factors (sluggish growth abroad, global developments affecting investment, exports, and manufacturing) and a potential positive shift (indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate). It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The FOMC may use such information to balance risks and adjust policy as needed to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy direction."
2,"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that commodity prices have been rising sharply, which could signal increasing inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, rising inflation may prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,If the prices are wrong -- built on the base on an incorrect view of the economy or Federal Reserve intentions -- we will prove them wrong and provide an anchor for the market to adjust to.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to take action to correct market prices if they are misaligned with the actual economic conditions or the Federal Reserve's intentions. This suggests that the FOMC is prepared to adjust monetary policy to ensure that market expectations align with their goals for inflation and employment, which could involve tightening if prices are too high due to an incorrect view that the Fed will be more accommodative than it intends to be. The use of ""prove them wrong"" implies a proactive stance in managing monetary policy to influence market conditions, which is typically associated with a hawkish approach."
2,It is precisely because none of these preconditions hold that monetary policy is so difficult and principles are needed to guide its implementation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of monetary policy implementation and the need for guiding principles, which suggests a balanced approach that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish. It reflects an understanding of the FOMC's principles and the challenges in achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,This information helps Committee members deduce how their own actions and statements are likely to affect asset prices and yields.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the process by which FOMC members consider the impact of their actions and statements on financial markets, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of the relationship between policy decisions and market outcomes, which is a fundamental aspect of conducting monetary policy, but it does not reveal whether the Committee is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Putting It All Together I would now like to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in figure 6.7 To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the contributions of various factors to the U.S. trade deficit, which is a more general economic assessment rather than a specific policy direction. The focus on understanding the reasons behind the trade deficit suggests a balanced approach to analyzing economic conditions without signaling a move towards either more hawkish or dovish monetary policy actions."
2,"In a traditional growth accounting setup, these effects would show up in multifactor productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a technical aspect of economic analysis (growth accounting and multifactor productivity growth) rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly address employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is simply a statement about where certain economic effects would be observed within an economic framework."
2,"It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today.1 I look forward to our conversation, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory remark that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It merely sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, monetary policy, and the new policy framework without indicating a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"I would like to address two aspects of the issue of underemployment of minorities: first, the implications of ignoring the potential that already exists and, second, the need to encourage young people to seek the types of education and training that will meet the demands of work in the twenty-first century.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the broader issues of underemployment among minorities and the importance of education and training for the future workforce. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it addresses long-term structural issues in the labor market, which are not immediately related to the FOMC's short-term monetary policy decisions. The focus on underemployment and education suggests a concern for maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals, but does not provide clear guidance on the direction of policy adjustments."
1,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have also picked up.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, which suggests that expectations for inflation are rising. In the context of the Federal Reserve's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract higher inflation expectations and ensure price stability, one of the key objectives of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target temporarily. This approach suggests that the FOMC is focused on ensuring that inflation does not fall persistently below its long-term goal, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming too high or unanchored. By stating a commitment to an average inflation target, the FOMC is signaling that it may be less accommodative in the future if inflation consistently runs above the target, to balance out periods when inflation was below the target."
2,"For the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) at the Bank of England, they find heterogeneous views among voters, but no systematic differences based on whether the MPC member is an insider--that is part of the hierarchy at the Bank--or an outsider appointed for a short term just to the MPC; whether the person comes from an academic background; or whether that person has worked at the Treasury.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the composition and diversity of opinions within the Monetary Policy Committee at the Bank of England, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that there are no systematic differences in voting patterns based on the background of the MPC members, which does not suggest a leaning towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Longer-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12 5.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is recognition of high current inflation, there is also a belief among households, businesses, and market participants that this inflation is transitory and that the Fed will maintain its long-term inflation objective. This suggests a balance between concerns over current inflation and confidence in the Fed's commitment to its target, without a clear indication of immediate policy tightening or easing. The statement reflects an expectation that the situation will normalize without necessarily requiring a change in policy stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,Productivity and the equilibrium real interest rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Productivity and the equilibrium real interest rate"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It merely references two economic concepts that are relevant to monetary policy decisions. Productivity can influence the economy's potential growth, while the equilibrium real interest rate is a theoretical rate at which the economy is balanced (neither overheating nor underperforming). Without additional context indicating whether the FOMC views changes in productivity or the equilibrium real interest rate as reasons to adjust monetary policy, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the classification is neutral."
1,"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive employment situation with millions of new jobs created and a low unemployment rate that has been sustained over two years. This information on its own does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states the current employment conditions, which are in line with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. Without additional context on inflation or other economic indicators, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the current account deficit is growing due to increased investment and productivity in the U.S., as well as capital inflows attracted by higher U.S. rates of return. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects economic conditions that could be associated with either a strong economy (which might lead to a hawkish stance) or with imbalances that could be addressed by various policy responses. Without a clear indication of how the FOMC plans to respond to these conditions, the stance is neutral."
0,"U.S. monetary policy responded to these global ""headwinds,"" helping stave off actual contractions of U.S. activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the U.S. monetary policy was adjusted to counteract negative global economic factors (""headwinds"") and prevent a contraction in U.S. economic activity. This suggests that the policy action was aimed at easing conditions to support the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates and looser monetary policy to stimulate economic growth."
1,"With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal that we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis point hike would help do that.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tightening of monetary policy. It suggests that with the economy at full employment and inflation above the FOMC's 2% target, there is a need to move quickly back to a neutral policy stance. The mention of a 50-basis point hike is a clear indication of a desire to raise interest rates, which is a typical hawkish response to combat higher inflation."
1,"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of addressing projected growth in entitlement spending on expectations of stability, which is more related to fiscal policy rather than the direct monetary policy actions typically discussed in FOMC statements. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather points to the importance of managing long-term fiscal issues for overall economic stability. The FOMC's focus is on monetary policy, and while fiscal policy can influence economic conditions, this sentence does not directly indicate a change in the stance of monetary policy."
0,"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the U.S. economy, noting the transition from recovery to expansion and reflecting on the rapid and robust recovery in GDP. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of past economic performance. The focus is on the historical context and the speed of the recovery, without explicit policy direction."
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the FOMC's inflation target and does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It describes a historical decision regarding the specific target for price stability, which is part of the FOMC's broader framework for conducting monetary policy. The 2 percent inflation target is a long-term goal that guides the Committee's decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate policy action or change."
2,"Our test for this step was making ""substantial further progress"" toward our employment and inflation goals.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a criterion (""substantial further progress"" toward employment and inflation goals) that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) uses to evaluate the need for changes in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing policy, but rather it sets a benchmark for assessing policy adjustments. The use of the term ""substantial further progress"" suggests a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators before deciding on a monetary policy stance."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests concern about a potential increase in core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by influencing inflation expectations to rise. This implies a risk of inflation exceeding the target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and maintain price stability."
2,"During much of the recovery, forecasters have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical perspective on forecasters' expectations regarding economic growth and labor market developments without directly suggesting a future course of monetary policy action. It neither indicates an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation on past forecasting trends related to employment and economic growth. This statement does not directly relate to the current stance or future adjustments of monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a scenario where major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, responded to crises (the Global Financial Crisis and the Global Pandemic Collapse) by cutting policy rates to their effective lower bounds, increasing their balance sheets through large-scale asset purchase and lending programs, and providing forward guidance on future monetary policies. These actions are indicative of a dovish stance, as they involve easing monetary policy to support the economy during times of financial stress and economic downturns. The measures mentioned are designed to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, increasing liquidity, and reassuring markets about the future path of monetary policy."
2,"Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the relationship between asset prices, spending, and macroeconomic indicators like the unemployment rate, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather comments on economic conditions and their interrelations."
2,"Similarly, I don't think we yet fully understand the role of Year 2000 preparations in either the late 1990s investment boom or the acceleration in productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a neutral stance as it discusses the uncertainty regarding the impact of Year 2000 preparations on past economic events, specifically the investment boom and productivity acceleration in the late 1990s. It does not directly indicate a current or future policy action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a gap in understanding historical economic phenomena, which does not provide clear guidance on the direction of monetary policy adjustments."
2,"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes projections for unemployment and inflation that align with the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) median projections, indicating expectations of progress towards the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of the economic outlook that is consistent with the Committee's objectives. The mention of eliminating the ""employment gap"" and aligning with the demographic trend in labor force participation suggests a positive outlook on employment, while the reference to personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation projections being similar to the median suggests stability in price levels. Both aspects are key goals of the FOMC, and the sentence does not lean towards a policy shift but rather indicates a continuation of the current policy stance aimed at achieving these goals."
0,"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation regarding stock prices in relation to the economic conditions of 1929. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate actions to be taken by the FOMC in terms of tightening or easing. It merely reflects on the relationship between market perceptions and underlying economic realities, without providing guidance on current policy decisions."
2,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the technical aspects of economic measurement rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It discusses the need for clear definitions and consistent units in measuring productivity and standards of living, which is important for economic analysis but does not directly suggest a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"As the economy approached full employment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve System, was faced with the classic problem of managing the mid-cycle slowdown--that is, of setting policy to help guide the economy toward sustainable growth without inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is focused on managing a mid-cycle slowdown by guiding the economy toward sustainable growth without inflation, which suggests a concern for preventing overheating and controlling inflation. This implies a stance that may favor tightening monetary policy to avoid inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish approach."
0,"Less uncertainty about future inflation could lower the risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds, lowering the risk-free interest rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential outcome of reduced uncertainty about future inflation, which could lead to lower risk premiums on nominal Treasury bonds and thus a lower risk-free interest rate. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses a possible effect on interest rates based on market perceptions of inflation risk. It reflects an understanding of how expectations can influence financial conditions, which is consistent with the FOMC's principles of transparency and responsiveness to economic indicators."
2,"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of inflation has been relatively stable in Brazil, at around 5 percent, and it has been declining in Mexico, where it is now around 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed stability and decline in the variability of inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply provides an assessment of inflation trends in these countries, which does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy. The focus on inflation stability aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices, but the sentence does not reveal any specific policy stance or action."
1,"Such second-round effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure 1).","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is an increase in the relative price of energy, it is not expected to lead to a rise in long-term inflation expectations, suggesting that the current situation does not warrant a change in monetary policy stance. The statement is balanced, acknowledging a potential risk (higher energy prices) but also noting that this risk has not materialized into increased inflation expectations, which would be a concern for the FOMC. Therefore, the sentence does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing policy, but rather a wait-and-see approach."
0,"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the potential broad economic impacts of monetary policy actions targeted at a specific sector, suggesting a cautious approach. It does not directly imply an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of policy decisions and their wide-ranging effects. This reflects a balanced stance, weighing the risks of policy actions against their intended outcomes in the context of the FOMC's broader goals."
2,"To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (2007) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the reliability of staff forecasts of inflation compared to statistical benchmarks, which is more about the accuracy of economic forecasting than a direct indication of current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method for assessing inflation by excluding volatile food and energy prices to get a better sense of underlying inflation pressures. This approach is a common practice known as looking at ""core inflation,"" which can provide a clearer view of the inflation trend without the short-term fluctuations caused by food and energy prices. The statement itself does not directly indicate a policy action towards tightening or easing but rather describes an analytical technique used to understand inflation dynamics. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to stable prices by focusing on inflation measures that are likely to persist over time, which is important for setting appropriate monetary policy."
2,"Lessons from Past Productivity Booms First, many of the technological innovations associated with past productivity booms were general purpose technologies (GPTs) with widespread applicability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about the nature of technological innovations during past productivity booms and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests imminent policy actions nor provides insight into the Committee's current assessment of economic conditions relative to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analytical perspective on understanding financial market prices by identifying risk premiums. This is part of the broader assessment process that informs the FOMC's policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"Conclusion To sum up, none of us, obviously, can see the future, and instead we shall have to monitor incoming data closely for evidence of any shifts in recent productivity trends.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a stance of vigilance and data-dependency, suggesting that the FOMC is open to adjusting policy as new information on productivity trends becomes available. This approach is consistent with a balanced and reactive monetary policy stance that neither commits to immediate action nor rules out future adjustments, aligning with the FOMC's principles of being informed by a range of indicators and balancing risks with long-term goals."
2,Mishkin and Jonas (forthcoming) describe the experiences of the three transition economies with inflation targets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is merely descriptive, referencing a study about the experiences of transition economies with inflation targets. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) nor does it provide insight into the current economic conditions or policy decisions of the FOMC. It lacks any direct reference to changes in the federal funds rate, employment levels, or inflation rates in the context of U.S. monetary policy."
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a review of monetary policy frameworks by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which is an activity related to assessing and potentially adjusting policy strategies. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to an ongoing process of evaluation. This kind of review is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not in itself reveal a current policy direction."
0,"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the value central bankers place on credibility in the context of disinflation costs but does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is more of a general statement on central banking principles rather than a specific policy direction."
2,Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fiscal observation regarding the budget balance without directly indicating a clear stance on the future direction of monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on fiscal developments. The FOMC might consider such information in its comprehensive analysis, but this statement alone does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
0,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects a positive economic development that could support both stable prices and maximum employment in the long term, but it does not explicitly signal an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement acknowledges the strength in productivity growth, which can be beneficial for the economy, but it does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC is aware of the underlying economic trends and is considering them in their policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for certain economic conditions to be met (sustained achievement of employment and inflation objectives) before raising interest rates (""liftoff""), combined with a tool to control interest rates across different maturities (""yield curve caps""). This approach is about being responsive to economic indicators and does not in itself indicate an immediate intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach that is contingent on the economic data, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Without the accompanying boost to productivity, our progress toward price stability might well have been marked by the social pressures that arose in many previous episodes of disinflation both here and abroad.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that without an increase in productivity, efforts to achieve price stability (i.e., controlling inflation) could lead to social pressures, which historically have been associated with periods of disinflation. This suggests a willingness to accept potential social discomfort in order to maintain price stability, indicating a stance that leans towards tightening monetary policy to control inflation, even if it may have some negative short-term social consequences."
2,"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the challenges that technological advancements and financial innovations pose to the traditional understanding and measurement of money, which complicates the implementation of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexities in the monetary policy framework due to structural changes in the financial system. This reflects a balanced view on the difficulties in applying traditional monetary policy tools in the face of evolving financial landscapes."
2,"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is inquiring about the nature of recessions following asset-price booms and busts, which is more of an analytical or research-oriented question rather than a direct statement on current monetary policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather suggests an interest in understanding economic phenomena that could inform future policy decisions."
2,"Required down payments, usually about half of the home's purchase price, excluded many households from the market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition of the housing market related to the size of required down payments and their effect on household participation, but it does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear insights into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is simply a statement of fact regarding market conditions without an explicit link to monetary policy actions."
2,"""2 One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""rational inattention"" in the context of how actual inflation may influence future inflation expectations. This concept suggests that individuals pay less attention to economic information that changes infrequently or has a minor impact on their decision-making. The statement itself does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the psychological and behavioral aspects of economic agents' responses to inflation, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC uses to inform its policy decisions. It does not provide specific guidance on the stance of monetary policy but rather offers insight into one of the many factors that the Committee might consider when evaluating the economic situation."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s when the models did not accurately predict actual money growth. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of monetary policy implementation and the limitations of economic models, which is a neutral observation in the context of current policy stance."
1,"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical economic cycles and the causes of past downturns, specifically noting that financial imbalances, rather than inflation in goods and services, were elevated at those times. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in policy towards tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context and an analysis of past events, which could be used to inform current decision-making but does not in itself advocate for a particular direction in monetary policy."
1,"Notably, if people feel sure that inflation will remain well controlled, they will be more restrained in their wage-setting and pricing behavior, which (in something of a virtuous circle) makes it easier for the Federal Reserve to confirm their expectations by keeping inflation low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where public expectations of low inflation lead to moderate wage-setting and pricing behavior, which in turn helps the Federal Reserve maintain low inflation. This reflects a balanced view of the relationship between public expectations, inflation, and the Fed's actions, without indicating a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the importance of inflation expectations in achieving the Fed's goals but does not signal a change in policy stance."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983"" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement about economic growth potential, which could be influenced by various factors, including past monetary policy actions. However, without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this growth in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools, it cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish. It simply provides an economic outlook that could be consistent with either maintaining current policy or adjusting it in the future, depending on how the growth aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Developments during the Second Period: 1998-2007 Research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on past research and its contributions to the understanding of monetary policy design in the face of uncertainty. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or suggest an imminent change in policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a historical context and acknowledges the evolving nature of economic research, which is a neutral statement regarding policy direction."
2,"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about inflationary pressures resulting from excessive government spending financed by money creation. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent the devaluation of nominal assets and to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish viewpoint. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to rising inflation to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is an educational statement that describes the Federal Reserve's general mandate and does not provide any specific information on current or future monetary policy actions. It does not indicate a leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the purpose of the Fed's monetary policy."
2,"The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses uncertainty regarding economic forecasts for activity, unemployment, and inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest an imminent policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges the challenges in making predictions, which is a neutral stance."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of economic recovery and improvement in the labor market, which is a neutral stance. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a wait-and-see approach as the economy begins to grow and the unemployment rate starts to decline. The statement reflects a balanced outlook, consistent with the FOMC's goals of fostering maximum employment and stable prices without committing to a specific policy action."
0,"While deflation appears to have eased in Japan recently, it is difficult to know how much of the improvement is due to monetary policy, and, of the part due to monetary policy, how much is due to the zero-interest-rate policy and how much to quantitative easing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the effects of monetary policy on deflation in Japan, considering the impact of zero-interest-rate policy and quantitative easing. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC but rather reflects on the effectiveness and attribution of different policy measures in another economy. The focus is on understanding the causes of economic changes rather than signaling a future policy direction for the FOMC."
2,"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic situation where GDP growth variance decreased and inflation rates fell from high levels. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on past economic conditions, which could be used to inform current policy but does not in itself suggest a specific policy direction."
2,We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970sâ€”not a happy story.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to historical events and does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests caution based on past experiences with oil price shocks but does not provide information on current or future policy actions. The mention of the 1970s oil price shocks is a reminder of the potential impact such events can have on inflation and economic stability, but it does not reveal the Committee's current policy inclination."
2,"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic behavior, noting that despite strong profit growth, there has been a modest recovery in capital expenditures, leading to an accumulation of cash by businesses. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of current economic conditions, which the FOMC might use to inform future policy decisions. The sentence reflects an effort to understand the underlying factors in the economy without suggesting a specific monetary policy action."
0,Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth"" suggests that the FOMC is concerned about the potential negative impact of current financial conditions on economic growth. This concern implies a stance that may favor easing monetary policy to mitigate the risk and support growth, aligning with a dovish approach. The dovish stance is typically associated with lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate the economy, which would be consistent with addressing downside risks to growth."
2,I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation"" is a neutral statement regarding monetary policy. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy. Instead, it clarifies a principle of economic understanding that growth and inflation are not directly causative, which is consistent with the FOMC's balanced approach to considering a range of indicators when making policy decisions. This statement could be part of a broader discussion on how the FOMC views the relationship between economic growth and inflation, which would inform their policy decisions without indicating a specific direction of policy change."
1,"Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by “jawboning,” guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policymakers are prepared to use additional tools to combat and control inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability. The mention of ""incomes policies,"" ""jawboning,"" ""guideposts,"" and ""price and wage controls"" implies a proactive approach to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes curbing inflation, even if it might involve some macroeconomic cost. This is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the readiness to use such tools reflects a commitment to adjusting policy to manage deviations in inflation."
0,"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the prices of exports and the balance of trade but does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is more of an observation on international trade dynamics and currency market influences rather than a comment on domestic monetary policy adjustments. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to the FOMC's policy regarding interest rates or other monetary tools."
2,That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle about the relationship between central bank independence and inflation outcomes in developed countries, as supported by economic research. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an understanding that central bank independence is typically associated with the ability to maintain lower inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a phenomenon that affects the FOMC's areas of concern (employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates) but does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It merely acknowledges the impact of asset prices on the economy without suggesting whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy in response."
0,"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the disinflationary effect of productivity will diminish, but it does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation about economic conditions rather than a clear policy direction. The FOMC might consider this information when making future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
1,"Central banks have adopted price stability as a key long-term objective, and they have become more transparent and systematic in their operations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general approach to monetary policy that central banks, including the FOMC, have adopted over time. It indicates a commitment to price stability as a primary goal and an emphasis on transparency and systematic operations. However, it does not provide specific information about current policy direction, whether tightening or easing, nor does it indicate a change in policy stance. It simply states a broad principle that guides central bank operations, which is consistent with the FOMC's long-term objectives."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to mitigate ""risks to the outlook,"" which implies concerns about potential economic downturns or other negative factors. A dovish stance is associated with lower interest rates and other measures to support economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,Here's a wonderful game: Assume that the ECB governing council or the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee replaced the Federal Open Market Committee and made monetary policy in the United States--or vice versa.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a hypothetical scenario that does not provide any direct indication of the current or future stance of monetary policy. It does not offer any information on tightening or easing of policy, nor does it reflect on the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It merely suggests a thought experiment and does not comment on the actual policy actions or intentions of the FOMC or any other central bank."
2,"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call ""changes in discount rates,"" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the factors contributing to variations in financial markets, particularly those unrelated to fundamental economic indicators. It refers to ""changes in discount rates"" in a context that suggests uncertainty and complexity in market dynamics, rather than directly indicating a stance on monetary policy. The mention of investor sentiment, risk aversion, and internal market dynamics does not provide clear guidance on whether the FOMC would tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the existence of non-fundamental factors that can affect markets, which the FOMC might consider but are not in themselves indicative of a policy direction."
1,This change has led many governments to be more willing to adopt institutional changes to improve central bank governance that have bolstered central bank credibility for maintaining low inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general trend among governments to adopt institutional changes that enhance central bank governance and credibility in maintaining low inflation. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC. Instead, it reflects a broader observation about the international approach to central banking practices."
2,"While each of the Asian economies is unique in many important respects, the sources of their spectacular growth in recent years, in some cases decades, and the problems that have emerged are relevant to a greater or lesser extent to nearly all of them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general assessment of economic conditions in Asian economies and does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on international economic conditions."
2,"Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the nature of productivity growth and its effects on demand but does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral observation on how productivity gains achieved through efficiency improvements (rationalization) differ from those achieved through increased investment spending in terms of their impact on demand. This statement does not explicitly suggest any immediate action for adjusting the monetary policy stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,How would that development affect the economy and monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""How would that development affect the economy and monetary policy?"" is a question that does not in itself indicate a clear direction of policy action. It suggests that the FOMC is considering the potential impact of an unspecified development on the economy and monetary policy, which is a neutral stance as it does not imply whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence reflects the Committee's commitment to analyzing economic changes and adjusting policy as needed to achieve its goals, but it does not provide information on what those adjustments might be."
0,"Though widely anticipated even before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse course.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that there was a recession and a decrease in employment, which led to pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse its previous course of action, likely meaning to ease monetary policy to support economic growth and employment. This suggests a stance towards a more accommodative policy, which is considered dovish."
1,"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an anticipation of tightening monetary policy, which is generally associated with an increase in interest rates to control inflation and manage economic growth. The reference to ""a more firmly established economic recovery"" suggests that the economy is strong enough to withstand the effects of tighter monetary policy, and the expectation is that the positive impact of higher external demand will offset any negative consequences for Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). This stance aligns with a hawkish view, as it implies readiness to tighten policy in response to improved economic conditions."
2,"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic context and the effects of global trade, competition, and increased productive capacity on American businesses and consumers, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It acknowledges factors that have influenced price control and consumer prices but does not suggest an immediate action or change in monetary policy stance."
1,"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that rising inflation is leading to increased expectations of persistent high inflation, which in turn is influencing wage and pricing decisions. This suggests a potential inflationary spiral, where expectations of high inflation can lead to actual inflation through self-fulfilling behaviors. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this situation would likely warrant a tightening of monetary policy to counteract rising inflation and anchor inflation expectations, thus aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"For many years, forecasters could assume a modest, but stable, trend productivity growth rate and fairly predictable growth in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes historical assumptions about productivity growth and labor force growth, which are factors in the overall economic environment. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic trends that may inform the FOMC's policy decisions."
2,"More subtly, my conclusion that the effects on inflation of transitory changes in commodity prices or in the value of the dollar tend to dissipate in the longer run depends on the assumption that the public's inflation expectations are well anchored.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the transitory nature of certain inflationary factors and their long-term impact, which hinges on the public's inflation expectations being stable. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of inflation dynamics. The focus on inflation expectations being ""well anchored"" implies a balanced view on the current state of inflation management, without indicating a clear direction for policy change."
2,Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests the use of interest rate caps in combination with forward guidance to enhance the credibility of yield curve caps, which would help manage market expectations and concerns about the central bank's balance sheet. This indicates a strategy to control interest rates and prevent them from rising too quickly, which is a form of tightening monetary policy. By reinforcing forward guidance, the FOMC is signaling its commitment to maintaining control over the yield curve, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance to ensure inflation targets are met and to avoid an overheated economy."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, given a constant economic outlook. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how market dynamics (specifically, the demand for long-term securities) can affect interest rates independently of the economic outlook. This understanding is part of the broader analysis the FOMC conducts when considering its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the adequacy of current techniques to measure inflation in the future, which is a technical question rather than a direct indication of the current stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather points to the importance of having accurate data to inform policy decisions. The focus is on the measurement and understanding of inflation, which is crucial for the FOMC to achieve its goal of stable prices, but the sentence does not provide a clear direction on policy actions."
1,Theory also teaches that the increase in the rate of return on capital--even if generated by a rise in the growth rate of technical change--ultimately requires an increase in real market interest rates.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that an increase in the rate of return on capital, possibly due to a rise in the growth rate of technical change, would necessitate higher real market interest rates. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to adjust to the higher returns on capital, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check."
2,It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there was excessive risk-taking and overextension of credit in the late 1990s, which could be seen as a factor contributing to financial instability or inflationary pressures. By highlighting ""undue optimism about prospects for repayment,"" it suggests that there may have been a need for a tighter monetary policy to prevent such overshooting, which aligns with a hawkish stance that favors increasing interest rates or taking measures to tighten the monetary supply to avoid overheating the economy."
