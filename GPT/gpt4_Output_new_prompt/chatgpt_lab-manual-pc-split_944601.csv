2,"One of the things we’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called “hysteresis.” And I raised the question as to whether or not this might operate in the opposite direction as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""hysteresis,"" which refers to the possibility that a recession can have a long-term negative impact on an economy's potential output. It also raises the question of whether the opposite might be true, implying that there could be a long-term positive impact under certain conditions. This statement is more of an economic observation rather than a direct indication of current or future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy, but rather reflects on economic theory and the potential long-term effects of economic cycles. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL, as it does not provide clear guidance on the direction of monetary policy."
2,"But in terms of just targeting growth, you know, I think—I actually think our dual mandate works very well, which is maximum employment and stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the FOMC's dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests satisfaction with the current framework for achieving these goals, implying a balanced approach rather than a shift towards either more aggressive or more accommodative measures."
0,"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects a slow economic recovery and a gradual decrease in unemployment. This suggests that the FOMC may maintain or introduce policies to stimulate the economy until it sees more significant improvements in employment, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to support growth and employment."
0,"Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, has been running close to 1½ percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is running below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that there is less upward pressure on prices, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy and possibly more room for easing to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the target rate."
1,The economy is continuing to make progress toward the FOMC’s objective of maximum sustainable employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goal of maximum sustainable employment, which suggests a positive outlook without explicitly signaling a need for immediate policy tightening or easing. It reflects an ongoing process rather than a completed goal, and does not in itself indicate a change in the current monetary policy stance."
0,"I expect that to continue, and I would expect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employment that’s for economic reasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of continued improvement in employment conditions, specifically regarding part-time employment for economic reasons. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather comments on the labor market's status. The statement aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but does not provide clear guidance on the direction of future policy adjustments."
2,And I fully expect it will return to solid growth and a solid labor market as well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of a return to solid growth and a solid labor market, which indicates a general optimism about the economic outlook without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not directly imply an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy, but rather conveys a belief in the resilience of the economy. This stance is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker believes the current economic conditions warrant maintaining low interest rates, which is indicative of a monetary policy stance that favors easing to support economic activity, rather than tightening to combat inflation. This dovish stance aligns with a focus on stimulating the economy and potentially addressing shortfalls in employment."
2,"You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, whether tightening or easing. It simply states a principle of monetary policy being forward-looking, which is a general approach to policy-making that considers future economic conditions and risks. This statement reflects a basic tenet of monetary policy without indicating a current or planned stance."
0,"The entire Committee is committed to achieving our 2 percent inflation objective over the December 16, 2015 medium term, just as we want to make sure that inflation doesn’t persist at levels above our Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL 2 percent objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to achieving the 2 percent inflation objective, with an emphasis on preventing inflation from persisting above this target. This suggests a willingness to tighten monetary policy if necessary to prevent higher inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
0,"And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a decline in unemployment, which is generally a positive sign for the economy and could suggest a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish stance). However, the fact that this decline is attributed to a decrease in labor force participation rather than an increase in employment suggests that the improvement in unemployment figures may not reflect a stronger labor market. This could imply that there is no immediate need for a change in monetary policy, making the stance neutral as it does not clearly lean towards tightening or easing. The sentence reflects the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment but also acknowledges the complexity of interpreting employment data, which can be influenced by nonmonetary factors such as labor force participation rates."
1,"Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Admittedly, some of the wage increases is being eaten away by inflation"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of inflation on real income, which is a concern for the FOMC's mandate of stable prices. However, without additional context on the FOMC's response or interpretation of this wage and inflation dynamic, the stance remains balanced or unclear."
2,I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I’m old enough to remember what very high inflation was like"" does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy or future actions. It is a reflective statement that does not provide information on whether the speaker believes monetary policy should be tightened or eased. It does not discuss current economic conditions, inflation trends, or employment figures in relation to the FOMC's goals or policy adjustments. Therefore, it is classified as neutral."
1,"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus were applied to an economy that was recovering rapidly, in the context of supply-side barriers leading to a vertical supply curve in certain parts of the economy. A vertical supply curve suggests that increases in demand lead to higher prices rather than an increase in output, which is a classic scenario for inflationary pressures. The reference to strong monetary policy in this context likely implies measures to tighten or reduce liquidity to counteract inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The FOMC would consider such actions to achieve its goal of stable prices, especially when facing supply-side constraints that could lead to inflation exceeding their 2% target."
0,"In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about the target inflation rate and does not directly indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states that with a 2 percent inflation objective, the real interest rate would be 1 percent, assuming the nominal rate is set accordingly. This reflects an understanding of the FOMC's inflation target but does not provide information on current or future policy moves."
2,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a comprehensive approach by considering various economic indicators such as activity, labor market conditions, and inflation. This suggests a balanced stance where they are neither signaling an immediate intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but are instead assessing a range of data to inform their decisions. This aligns with their commitment to their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an ongoing discussion about the adequacy of the unemployment rate as a measure of labor resource utilization. This suggests that the FOMC is considering various indicators to assess the labor market comprehensively, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving maximum employment, one of their key goals. The sentence does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance but rather indicates a neutral, evaluative position as part of their analysis and decision-making process."
1,"But to the extent that continues to be the case, that should make it easier to restore price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if a certain condition persists, it will facilitate the process of restoring price stability, which is one of the FOMC's key goals. Restoring price stability often involves measures to reduce inflation, which can include tightening monetary policy. Therefore, the sentence suggests a stance that is more inclined towards taking action to control inflation, which is considered hawkish."
0,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the FOMC's target of 2 percent for some time. This suggests that the Committee may be less inclined to implement immediate tightening measures to combat inflation, but it also implies that they are anticipating future actions to address the inflation overshoot. This forward-looking stance, which accepts short-term inflation above target, is typically associated with a longer-term view that may involve eventual tightening to bring inflation back to the desired level, thus it can be seen as hawkish in the context of future policy adjustments."
2,"We’re also, as part of our review, looking at potential innovations, changes to the way we think about things, changes to the framework that would lead us—that would be more supportive of achieving inflation on a 2 percent—on a symmetric 2 percent basis over time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering innovations and changes to its framework that would support achieving its inflation target more effectively. This suggests a willingness to adapt policy to ensure inflation reaches the symmetric 2 percent goal, which may involve easing monetary policy if inflation is below target. The focus on achieving inflation on a symmetric basis implies a tolerance for periods of higher inflation to balance periods when inflation has been below the target, which is generally considered a dovish stance."
2,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,"" does not provide enough context or information to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence could be part of a broader discussion on how monetary policy affects asset prices, but without additional context, it does not suggest a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is becoming more widespread, particularly in the services sector. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not confined to specific areas and may be becoming more entrenched, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising further and to steer it back towards the FOMC's target of 2% over the long term. A hawkish stance is typically associated with concerns about inflation and the actions taken to control it, such as raising interest rates."
1,It isn’t the kind of inflation that’s spread broadly across the economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not widespread across the economy, which implies that there may not be a pressing need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. This could be interpreted as a sign that the FOMC does not see immediate inflationary pressures as a threat to their long-term target of 2% inflation, thus leaning towards a more accommodative stance."
0,"Of course, we can’t do anything about long-run employment opportunities, but we can help the economy recover more quickly.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the FOMC is willing to take action to support the economy's recovery, which suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and improve employment conditions. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it indicates a focus on boosting economic activity rather than on tightening policy to combat inflation."
0,"And I can only say qualitatively that the Committee will continue to look at the evolution of the outlook, try to assess whether unemployment is making sufficient progress towards our objectives, and, in particular, whether the recovery is still continuing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is monitoring economic indicators to assess progress towards its goals, without signaling a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, focusing on the dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices, while also ensuring the continuation of the economic recovery. The use of ""qualitatively"" and the lack of specific policy direction suggest a neutral stance."
0,"Well, that’s—what’s happening there is the fact that the relationship between resource utilization, or unemployment, and inflation has just gotten weaker and weaker over the years.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the historically observed relationship between resource utilization (or unemployment) and inflation is weakening. This suggests that low unemployment is not leading to higher inflation as it might have in the past. In the context of monetary policy, this could imply that there is less need to tighten policy (i.e., raise interest rates) in response to falling unemployment, as it is not fueling inflation as expected. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it leans towards a less aggressive approach to tightening monetary policy."
0,"I don’t think we look at—I understand what you’re asking, but we’re looking at—our mandate is price inflation and maximum employment, and that’s what we’re looking at with setting interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The speaker is emphasizing the focus on these two core objectives when setting interest rates, which does not inherently suggest an imminent policy change to either increase or decrease interest rates."
2,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes uncertainty among firms regarding government contracts and how this affects their employment decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the influence of nonmonetary factors on employment, which is one of the economic indicators the FOMC monitors. The sentence does not provide clear evidence of a shift towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
0,"The Federal Reserve’s enhanced guidance about its policy intentions and its substantial and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities will ensure that monetary policy remains highly accommodative, consistent with the pursuit of its mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy stance through clear communication about its policy intentions and by increasing its holdings of longer-term securities. This approach is aimed at supporting the economy in achieving its goals of maximum employment and price stability, which suggests a leaning towards easing rather than tightening monetary policy. The use of ""highly accommodative"" implies that the Fed is focused on stimulating economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish stance."
0,"You know, stimulating aggregate demand is one thing, but where there’s a part of the economy that kind of will be resistant to that, you also need fiscal policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the role of fiscal policy in stimulating parts of the economy that may not respond to monetary policy actions aimed at boosting aggregate demand. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the limitations of monetary policy and the need for complementary fiscal measures. This reflects a balanced view on the tools available for managing the economy, without a clear indication of a shift towards either a more hawkish or dovish monetary policy stance."
2,These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a technical factor (base effects) that will temporarily influence inflation measurements. It does not directly indicate a policy action or change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an analysis of expected statistical changes in inflation data, which the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions. The sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy response."
2,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates."" does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It is merely an introductory statement to a discussion or answer about exchange rates, without any indication of policy direction regarding tightening, easing, or maintaining the current stance."
0,"The changes—the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer-term rates, and the strengthening of the dollar, suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rates somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a strengthening in the dollar.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market participants are expecting expansionary fiscal policies, which would likely lead to higher interest rates in the United States relative to other countries and a strengthening of the dollar. This expectation of rising interest rates suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as higher rates can be used to control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. The anticipation of such policies aligns with a hawkish stance, where the focus is on preventing the economy from overheating and keeping inflation in check."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that falling oil prices are contributing to lower inflation, which suggests that there is less upward pressure on prices. This could indicate that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflationary concerns are being mitigated by external factors like declining oil prices. Lower inflation is generally associated with a dovish stance, where the central bank may not feel the need to raise interest rates aggressively to curb inflation."
2,"But, really, it isn’t monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But, really, it isn’t monetary policy."" does not provide any indication of a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It seems to be making a statement that something (context not provided) is not related to monetary policy, which does not reflect a position on the direction of policy changes. Therefore, without additional context suggesting a shift towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions, the sentence is classified as neutral."
0,"So, you know, I can’t—all I can tell you is, we’ll be looking at weak global growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is monitoring global economic conditions, specifically weak global growth, which is a part of their overall assessment of economic factors. However, the statement does not directly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing. It reflects a stance of vigilance and data-dependency without a clear directional bias."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The dovish stance implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative to support further improvements in employment without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
0,"Now, members of the Committee have different views about why this is likely to be true, that the funds rate—when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to our objective—they maybe have slightly different views on exactly why it’s likely to be the case that interest rates will be a little lower than they would in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the Committee members' views on the likely level of interest rates when the labor market is normalized and inflation is back to the objective, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that there is an expectation of interest rates being lower in the future compared to the longer run, but it does not specify whether this is due to a dovish or hawkish stance. Instead, it reflects a discussion on the equilibrium interest rate in the context of normalized labor market conditions and the inflation target being met, which is a neutral assessment of future policy without immediate implications for policy adjustments."
2,it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook"" suggests that there is a factor at play that could influence the trajectory of inflation. Given the FOMC's mandate to maintain stable prices and its target of a 2% inflation rate over the long term, any indication that inflation could rise would typically lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating of the economy. Therefore, the sentence implies a concern for potential inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the trimmed mean measures of inflation did not decrease significantly, but it does not clearly suggest a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states an observation about inflation measures without indicating whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is factual and does not imply a clear action towards achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"And that is a statement about productivity growth, which has been pretty disappointing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a neutral observation about productivity growth, which does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply provides an assessment of economic conditions, specifically productivity growth, which is one of the many factors the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"I mean certain parts of South Carolina have developed pretty strongly but the part where I come from—mostly agricultural, it has a little bit of manufacturing—has a very high unemployment rate, a high foreclosure rate, and people are having a hard time there.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes regional economic conditions, specifically in parts of South Carolina, mentioning high unemployment and foreclosure rates, which indicates economic distress in that area. However, it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides context on local economic disparities. The FOMC considers such information in its comprehensive assessment of the economy, but this sentence alone does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
2,I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concerns about the scope for monetary policy but does not clearly indicate whether the speaker believes policy should be tightened or eased. It suggests a consideration of the effectiveness or limitations of monetary policy tools without a clear direction on policy stance, thus it is neutral with respect to being hawkish or dovish."
0,and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""and inflation rises slowly towards 2 percent"" indicates that inflation is moving toward the Federal Reserve's target rate but does not explicitly suggest immediate action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a scenario where the economy is moving toward the desired state at a gradual pace, which is consistent with the FOMC's long-term inflation goal. There is no clear indication of a policy shift in either direction, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
1,"These are, you know, this is—this is the economy at nearly full employment or in the range—in the neighborhood of full employment.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is operating at or near full employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. When the economy is at full employment, the risk of inflation tends to increase as employers compete for workers, potentially driving up wages and prices. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Therefore, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, indicating a potential tightening of monetary policy to maintain stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"You’ll never get inflation to 2 percent.” Some of our critics now who say inflation’s too tight—too high were the same ones who were saying, “You’ll never get to 2 percent.” Well, but anyway, that’s what happened.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a commentary on past criticisms and does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the variability in achieving the inflation target but does not provide information on the Committee's current or planned response to inflation trends."
2,"And as I mentioned, I think at the last press conference, estimates by the—by members of the Committee have moved down by a full percentage point since maybe 2012 as we’ve learned—as unemployment has dropped and inflation hasn’t really reacted.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite a significant drop in unemployment, inflation has not increased as might be expected. This suggests that the relationship between unemployment and inflation is weaker than previously thought, which could imply that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. The Committee members' estimates moving down suggests they are recognizing a lower risk of inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing monetary policy rather than tightening it."
1,"growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, highlighting positive aspects such as low unemployment, good job creation, and rising wages, which are indicative of a healthy economy. However, it does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply outlines the conditions of the services economy, which align with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of rising wages could be a concern for inflation, but without further context suggesting concern or satisfaction from the FOMC, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Growth in household spending moderated toward the end of last year"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states an observation about economic activity, without suggesting whether the FOMC should respond with a change in policy. This could be seen as a neutral statement because it does not directly relate to the FOMC's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards not tightening monetary policy (raising rates) solely based on low unemployment figures unless there is accompanying inflation. This suggests a tolerance for lower unemployment without preemptive rate hikes, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes supporting employment and is less concerned with immediate inflationary pressures, as long as they remain within target levels."
2,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC anticipates being able to adjust policy in a way that results in lower-than-expected increases in unemployment, which implies a focus on supporting employment levels. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the priority is to avoid or minimize job losses, even in the face of potential inflationary pressures, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment. The reference to the high ratio of vacancies to unemployed indicates that the labor market is tight, which could typically lead to inflationary pressures through wage increases. However, the statement implies that the FOMC believes it can manage policy to prevent significant rises in unemployment, suggesting a preference for easing or maintaining an accommodative stance to support the labor market."
2,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of unemployment insurance benefits on the labor market and acknowledges the uncertainty of this impact. It also notes the temporal aspect of these benefits, which are set to expire. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation on a factor that could influence the labor market and, by extension, monetary policy decisions. The focus on the expiration of benefits and its uncertain effect on employment does not suggest an immediate action or change in policy stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"So the FOMC will always, in some sense, trump the projections of forward interest rates, but clearly, because the participants and the people around the table are the same, the projections should give significant information about where the FOMC is likely to go.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between the FOMC's decision-making process and the projections of forward interest rates. It suggests that while the FOMC's decisions are paramount (""trump the projections""), the projections themselves are still a valuable indicator of the FOMC's future direction because they are made by the same participants. This statement does not directly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the dynamics between projections and actual policy decisions. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to transparency and the use of a range of indicators in its decision-making process."
2,"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely states an observation about the current state of unemployment and social issues, without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not provide information on inflation or the federal funds rate, which are key indicators of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
0,"However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the unemployment rate is still high, which suggests that the economy might not be at full capacity and that there may be room for monetary policy to be eased to support job creation and economic growth. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment and could imply that there is less immediate concern for inflationary pressures that would necessitate a tightening of monetary policy."
2,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will align with the Federal Reserve's long-term target of 2 percent, suggesting neither an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects a forecast that is consistent with the FOMC's goals for price stability, without signaling a clear shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy stance."
2,It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It seems to be describing a factor or a formula that might be considered in the context of economic analysis or policy setting. The reference to inflation and productivity growth is neutral because it does not suggest any particular action or concern about the current economic conditions. It simply states components that could be part of an economic assessment or target."
0,"With unemployment still elevated and inflation below the Committee’s longer-run objective, the Committee is continuing its highly accommodative policies.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is maintaining a stance of monetary easing due to unemployment being higher than desired and inflation being below the Committee's long-term goal of 2%. This suggests that the Committee is focused on stimulating the economy to address these issues, which aligns with a dovish policy stance that supports lower interest rates and other measures to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,We have long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a policy goal regarding the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, aiming for it to be at the smallest level that still allows for efficient and effective monetary policy. This statement does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a general principle for managing the balance sheet over time. It reflects a balanced approach to policy implementation, ensuring that the tools available for conducting monetary policy are optimized without signaling a specific direction for future policy moves."
1,"So that’s the kind of thinking we’ll be doing, and, again, we’re looking—ultimately, we’re not going to declare victory until we see a series of these, really see convincing evidence, compelling evidence, that inflation is coming down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to not easing monetary policy until there is convincing and compelling evidence that inflation is decreasing. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on combating inflation and is prepared to maintain or even tighten monetary policy to ensure that inflation trends towards their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The U.S. economy is in a good place, and we will continue to use our monetary policy tools to help keep it there"" suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to maintain the current economic conditions. The use of the phrase ""a good place"" implies satisfaction with the current state of the economy in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices.

1,"Also, the Committee will pay close attention to measures of inflation expectations to ensure that those expectations remain well anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is focused on monitoring inflation expectations to ensure they do not become unanchored, which would suggest a commitment to preventing inflation from rising uncontrollably.

A reduction in interest rates is typically a sign of a dovish monetary policy stance, as it suggests that the FOMC is aiming to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper, which can help to boost investment and consumption. This action is often taken in response to concerns about economic growth or below-target inflation, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that both monetary and fiscal policies have roles in stimulating economic growth. It does not explicitly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complementary use of different policy tools to achieve economic objectives. The mention of fiscal policy playing a role does not inherently suggest a shift in the stance of monetary policy, thus the classification is neutral."
