0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It reaffirms the Committee's ongoing commitment to its dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability, which is a standard objective of the FOMC. The sentence does not indicate whether the Committee is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it provide details on the current economic conditions that would necessitate a change in policy stance. Therefore, it is considered neutral."
0,"Moreover, inflation was running at a fairly low rate and quite possibly would edge down a little further over coming quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is not only currently low but also expected to decrease slightly in the near future. This indicates that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In a dovish stance, the FOMC might be more inclined to maintain or lower interest rates to support economic activity, as low inflation is typically not a trigger for monetary policy tightening."
2,"A few participants judged that while the labor market was close to full employment, some margins of slack remained; these participants pointed to the employment-to-population ratio or the labor force participation rate for prime-age workers, which remained below pre-recession levels, as well as the absence to date of clear signs of a pickup in aggregate wage growth.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite the labor market being close to full employment, there are indicators of remaining slack, such as the employment-to-population ratio and labor force participation rate for prime-age workers not yet reaching pre-recession levels, and the lack of significant wage growth. This implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy, as there is no strong evidence of overheating in the labor market that could lead to inflationary pressures. The focus on the absence of wage growth and remaining slack aligns with a dovish stance, which would support maintaining or easing monetary policy to encourage further improvement in employment without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation due to specific categories (food and non-energy imports), but it does not directly suggest a policy action such as tightening or easing. It merely states an observation about inflation trends without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might consider this information in the context of their broader goals, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
2,"With the Committee in the process of reviewing its monetary policy strategies and communication, and no additional accommodation being provided at this meeting, a few members indicated that they could support the Committee's decision even though they had not favored recent policy actions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while some members did not agree with recent policy actions, they are willing to support the Committee's current decision to not provide additional accommodation. This suggests a pause or status quo in policy rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing. The mention of a review of monetary policy strategies and communication also implies a period of assessment rather than immediate action, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have reached a consensus to maintain the current stance of monetary policy without any changes. This suggests a balanced approach, neither tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy at the time of the meeting. It reflects a decision to hold steady and suggests that the current policy is in line with their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits, factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a situation where business sentiment is negative, growth in sales and profits is disappointing, and there is an excess of capital and idle capacity. These conditions suggest economic weakness, which would typically lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment, as there is no immediate concern for inflationary pressures due to excess capacity."
2,"Their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year, as measured by the PCE chain-type price index, were centered in a range of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent, with a full range of 1-1/4 to 1-3/4 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members' forecasts for consumer price inflation are centered well below the Committee's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that inflation is not seen as a pressing concern at the moment, which could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Instead, the focus might be on supporting economic activity, as lower inflation could provide room for a more accommodative stance to achieve maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Economic data releases were mixed, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but market participants were especially attentive to incoming information on the labor market--most notably, the private payroll figures in the employment report for May, which were considerably weaker than investors expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the reaction of market participants to mixed economic data, with a focus on weaker-than-expected private payroll figures. It does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects the ongoing assessment of economic conditions. The FOMC may consider such data in the context of their employment goals, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy direction."
2,Members also agreed that there was only a remote possibility that the process of disinflation would cumulate to the point of a decline for an extended period in the general price level.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members believe that the likelihood of a deflationary period is low, implying confidence in the effectiveness of their current or planned monetary policy measures to prevent deflation and maintain inflation near the target level. This stance is consistent with a tighter monetary policy, as it indicates vigilance against inflation falling below the desired level, which could lead to a less accommodative stance to ensure price stability."
0,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite positive developments, there are factors expected to limit economic growth. This suggests a cautious or accommodative stance, as the FOMC may be more likely to ease monetary policy to support the expansion in the face of these restraining factors. It aligns with a dovish approach, which is typically characterized by efforts to stimulate the economy, often through lower interest rates or other expansionary measures."
0,"On the foreign trade side of the economy, an anticipated firming of economic conditions abroad would provide impetus to real net exports, At the same time, however, imports were expected to rise appreciably in response to the expansion of domestic economic activity and the appreciation of the dollar, and on balance the external sector probably would not be boosting real GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations regarding the balance of trade and its impact on real GDP, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges both positive (firming of economic conditions abroad) and negative (rise in imports due to domestic economic expansion and dollar appreciation) factors that are expected to offset each other, suggesting that the external sector would likely have a neutral impact on real GDP growth. This does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy stance, as it does not specifically address inflation or employment objectives."
2,"Participants' Views and Committee Policy ActionIn conjunction with this FOMC meeting, all meeting participants--the five members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks--provided projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and consumer price inflation for each year from 2009 through 2011 and over a longer horizon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of gathering economic projections from FOMC participants, which is a standard part of their meetings to inform policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather reflects the Committee's commitment to being informed and data-driven when making policy decisions. The sentence shows the FOMC's dedication to transparency and careful consideration of economic indicators, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty about the current level of resource slack in the economy, which suggests that the FOMC is considering both the possibility of the economy operating close to potential and the potential for labor force participation to affect this assessment. The mention of uncertainty and the balanced view of potential outcomes reflect a neutral stance, as the FOMC is neither signaling a clear move towards tightening nor easing monetary policy but is instead weighing different economic indicators and their implications for future policy decisions."
1,"The expansion of M3 picked up over September and October, reflecting a strong acceleration in its non-M2 component that was associated with strong inflows to institutional money market funds and stepped-up issuance of large time deposits to meet credit demands.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a significant increase in the broad money supply (M3), particularly due to a rise in institutional money market funds and large time deposits. This could be interpreted as a sign of increased liquidity in the economy, which might lead to inflationary pressures if it outpaces economic growth. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if the Committee perceives this expansion as potentially inflationary, it might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent an overheating economy, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
2,"The review of regional economic developments by the Federal Reserve Bank presidents pointed to moderate expansion in economic activity across much of the nation, though growth was described as modest in a few regions and relatively robust in some others.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a varied pace of economic growth across different regions, with no clear indication of a uniform or extreme condition that would prompt a change in monetary policy. The use of terms like ""moderate expansion,"" ""modest,"" and ""relatively robust"" suggests a mixed economic environment that does not strongly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. This balanced view aligns with the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators and maintaining a steady approach to achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Many members were concerned about the still-sensitive state of financial markets and thought that an easing of policy would help to support improvements in market functioning, thereby mitigating some of the downside risks to economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members are considering an easing of monetary policy to support financial markets and mitigate risks to economic growth. Easing policy typically involves lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors more accommodative monetary policy to support employment and growth when there is less concern about inflationary pressures."
2,"In contrast, economic activity declined in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic performance in Japan, which does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening nor easing of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The focus on a foreign economy's activity does not inherently reflect the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States."
2,"For 1997 the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1996 for growth of the monetary aggregages and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC decided to maintain the same growth ranges for monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach reflects a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making adjustments that would imply a shift in policy direction."
0,"Despite a recent uptick in consumer prices, year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that even though there has been a recent increase in consumer prices, the overall annual inflation rate is still very low. This suggests that there is not a significant inflationary pressure that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative to support economic activity without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,Industrial production picked up in response to the advance in final demand and a slowdown in the runoff of excess inventory stocks.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where industrial production is increasing due to higher final demand and a reduction in the excess inventory, which indicates an alignment with economic growth and does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC would need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it could be seen as a sign of a healthy economy (which might not require intervention) or as a potential precursor to inflationary pressures (which could warrant a more hawkish stance if other indicators suggest overheating). However, without additional context on inflation or employment, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a data-dependent approach, basing future policy adjustments on the incoming economic information related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a balanced stance, as the FOMC is neither committing to tightening nor easing monetary policy without further evidence. They are waiting to see how the economy evolves before making a decision, which aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters, but they also concurred that it would be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC members expect inflation to moderate, they also believe it is important to continue monitoring inflation developments closely. This suggests a balanced approach, as they are neither signaling an immediate need to tighten policy aggressively (which would be hawkish) nor indicating a need to ease policy due to diminishing inflation concerns (which would be dovish). They are maintaining vigilance and are prepared to adjust policy as needed, reflecting a neutral stance."
2,These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an observation of economic conditions, specifically unemployment rates, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest immediate concerns about inflation or employment that would prompt a tightening or easing of policy. Instead, it describes expected ranges for unemployment, which are used to gauge the health of the labor market relative to the FOMC's maximum employment goal. The statement is factual and does not imply any particular policy action, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"In those Districts in which activity had been adversely affected by the drop in energy prices, drilling activity was either contracting less rapidly or was stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in specific districts where economic activity has been impacted by falling energy prices, noting that drilling activity is showing signs of less contraction or stabilization. This observation does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an update on economic conditions in certain regions, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC would consider when making policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any imminent changes to the monetary policy but rather reports on regional economic developments."
2,Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced"" suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) views the potential for inflation to deviate from their target as equally likely to be higher or lower. This indicates that they do not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more than what is currently anticipated. The use of the word ""balanced"" implies that they believe the current policy stance is appropriate to maintain their inflation target and does not signal a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish position."
2,"Several participants noted that the unseasonably warm weather of recent months added one more element of uncertainty to the interpretation of incoming data, and that this factor might account for a portion of the recent improvement in indicators of employment and housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an external factor (unseasonably warm weather) on economic indicators, which adds uncertainty to the data interpretation. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges an element that complicates the assessment of economic conditions. This indicates a balanced approach, as the FOMC is considering how nonmonetary factors might be affecting key economic indicators without suggesting a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,Indicators for China in July pointed to only a modest slowing of output growth from its torrid pace in the first half of the year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic performance in China, noting a slight deceleration in output growth, but does not directly indicate a change in U.S. monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy by the FOMC. Instead, it provides context on international economic conditions, which may be one of many factors considered in the broader assessment of risks to the U.S. economic outlook."
1,"However, with tightening resource constraints indicating unsustainable growth, only tentative signs that growth might be slowing, and various factors that had been damping prices now turning around, all the members agreed on the need for a slight tightening at this meeting to raise the odds on containing inflation and forestalling the inflationary imbalances that would undercut the very favorable performance of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a consensus among FOMC members on the need for a slight tightening of monetary policy. This action is aimed at containing inflation and preventing imbalances that could harm the economy's performance. The reference to ""tightening resource constraints"" and ""unsustainable growth"" suggests concerns about overheating, which typically leads to a hawkish stance to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check. The decision to tighten policy aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and is a proactive measure to manage inflationary pressures."
1,"In addition, the forecast for headline PCE price inflation incorporated a much higher rate of increase for energy prices for the first half of the year; as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation, particularly due to rising energy prices, which suggests that the Federal Reserve might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and achieve its target of 2% inflation over the long term. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may raise interest rates or take other measures to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from escalating."
0,"Broad U. S. stock price indexes declined, on net, over the intermeeting period, apparently in response to the downbeat economic data.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market reaction to economic data, specifically a decline in stock price indexes, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of policy but rather reports on observed market conditions. The FOMC might consider such information in their decision-making process, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
1,"The expansion of M2 had declined substantially since late spring, apparently in part as a result of the widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2 stemming from higher market interest rates and possibly also from slackening growth in household incomes.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the growth of the money supply (M2) has slowed down due to higher market interest rates and potentially slower growth in household incomes. Higher market interest rates typically result from a tightening of monetary policy, as the central bank raises rates to control inflation and manage economic growth. The reference to ""widening opportunity costs of holding assets in M2"" suggests that other investments are becoming more attractive compared to holding money, which is a consequence of higher interest rates. This aligns with a hawkish stance, where the central bank is likely aiming to cool down the economy to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check."
0,"In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain a very low federal funds rate target, which is a sign of an easing monetary policy stance. The specific conditions mentioned for this policy—keeping rates low until unemployment is above a certain threshold and inflation projections are only slightly above the target—suggest that the Committee is focused on supporting employment and is willing to tolerate a modest overshoot in inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach. This stance is aimed at stimulating economic activity rather than containing inflation or cooling down the economy."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the economic forecast has been revised down due to external fiscal policy factors (federal spending sequestration) rather than a change in monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions. The impact of reduced government purchases is acknowledged as a drag on growth, but there is no clear indication of how the FOMC will respond with its monetary policy tools."
0,Most other market interest rates declined further on balance over the period in an atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation rather than a direct action or intention of the FOMC regarding monetary policy. It notes that market interest rates have declined and that there has been greater volatility, but it does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC views this as positive or negative, or how it might influence their policy decisions. The decline in rates could be seen as dovish if it were the result of FOMC action, but without context suggesting the FOMC's stance on this movement, the sentence itself is neutral."
1,The projection for core PCE price inflation in 2008 was raised slightly in response to elevated readings in recent months.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the projection for core PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation has been raised due to higher recent readings, which suggests a concern about higher inflation. Raising inflation projections typically implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,The unwinding in the early months of 1997 of special factors that had boosted net exports in the fourth quarter of 1996 was offsetting some of the effects on production of the persisting strength in domestic demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external factors (special factors boosting net exports) that were present in the previous quarter are no longer influencing production, and this change is counterbalanced by ongoing strong domestic demand. This statement does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions where positive and negative factors are offsetting each other. It reflects a balanced view of the economic situation without a clear direction for policy change."
1,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. A widening trade deficit could have various implications for the economy, but without additional context on how the FOMC might respond to this information in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools, the stance remains unclear. The sentence does not explicitly suggest actions to tighten or ease monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is considering the removal of policy accommodation, which typically means reducing monetary stimulus, such as raising interest rates or decreasing asset purchases. The phrase ""at a pace that would likely be measured"" suggests a gradual tightening of monetary policy. The commitment to respond to economic changes to maintain price stability further implies a readiness to adjust policy to prevent inflation from rising above the target, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a commitment to monitoring developments that could impact the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather a stance of vigilance and readiness to act as necessary to achieve its goals. The focus is on being informed and prepared rather than on a specific policy action."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC members are not ready to tighten monetary policy due to weaker labor market conditions and uncertainty about the inflation outlook. Waiting for more information before starting policy normalization (which typically involves raising interest rates to prevent overheating of the economy) implies a stance towards maintaining or easing the current monetary policy rather than tightening it. This dovish stance aligns with the goals of supporting employment and ensuring that inflation moves towards the target rate in a stable manner."
2,The threat to global economic growth and financial stability posed by the fiscal situation in some European nations sparked widespread flight-to-quality flows over most of the intermeeting period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors (the fiscal situation in some European nations) are causing a shift in market behavior (flight-to-quality flows), which is more of an observation of global economic conditions rather than an indication of the FOMC's own policy stance. It does not directly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges external risks that could potentially affect the U.S. economy and the FOMC's policy decisions."
2,"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members believe that the risk of further significant decreases in inflation (disinflation) has diminished. This implies that there is less concern about falling inflation rates, which could reduce the likelihood of the FOMC implementing further easing measures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a reduced fear of disinflation might lead to a tighter monetary policy stance to prevent potential inflation from rising above the target level."
1,"Several commented that an asymmetric directive did not imply a commitment to tighten monetary policy at some point, whether during the intermeeting period or at a future meeting, but it did imply the need for special vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards potential tightening of monetary policy in the future, as it suggests the need for ""special vigilance."" This vigilance is typically associated with being ready to act against inflationary pressures to maintain stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals. While it does not commit to immediate action, the emphasis on vigilance implies a readiness to tighten policy if necessary, which is a hawkish signal."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's view on economic projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation is consistent with historical averages, suggesting no immediate bias towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced perspective that does not explicitly signal a change in policy stance."
2,"Participants continued to expect that, as the effects of transitory factors waned and labor market conditions strengthened further, inflation would stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect inflation to stabilize at the Committee's target rate as temporary factors dissipate and the labor market improves. This expectation suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate to achieve the Committee's goals of stable prices and maximum employment over the medium term, without explicitly signaling a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view that is neither particularly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an assessment of economic conditions, specifically the role of business spending in influencing the pace of economic activity. This statement is more about gauging economic indicators that will inform future policy decisions rather than signaling an immediate policy stance. It suggests that the FOMC is monitoring economic data to determine the appropriate timing and degree of future policy actions, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
0,"Nonetheless, on balance, most members currently considered the upside risks to inflation to be a bit less pressing than those on the downside for the next few quarters.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members view the risks of inflation rising as less pressing than the risks of inflation falling in the near term. This suggests that they are more concerned about potential economic weakness that could lead to lower inflation, rather than an overheating economy that could lead to higher inflation. Such a view is consistent with a dovish stance, as it implies there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures."
1,Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about persistent inflationary pressures stemming from rising healthcare, insurance, and oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these pressures and maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Broad stock price indexes rose, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted in part by favorable earnings reports from the retail sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding stock prices rising due to favorable earnings reports from the retail sector. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the FOMC's future policy actions. It is simply a statement of fact about market conditions without a clear implication for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise as the economy uses up excess capacity (resource slack diminishes) and inflation expectations stay stable. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too quickly, in line with its goal of maintaining stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Although productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinarily rapid pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion, data for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as preliminary indications for the first quarter of this year, suggested that gains from efficiency remained substantial.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where productivity growth has slowed but still indicates efficiency gains. This observation does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. It provides an assessment of economic conditions without a clear indication of how the FOMC might adjust its policy in response. The sentence reflects an understanding of economic trends important for policy considerations but does not in itself advocate for a particular policy stance."
0,"Although inflation remained remarkably subdued and any increase in inflationary pressures likely would tend to emerge only slowly, the strength in demand had developed against the backdrop of financial conditions that, broadly considered, were not substantially different from those now prevailing.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is low and any rise in inflationary pressures is expected to be gradual. It also suggests that the current financial conditions have not changed significantly, implying that there is no immediate concern for inflation that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, where the focus might be on supporting economic growth and employment rather than on combating high inflation."
2,"Participants' assessments of the economic outlook were little changed, with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants' outlook on the economy is stable, with expectations for moderate growth that will gradually increase. There is no clear indication of a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an expectation that the current state of the economy will continue with a slight improvement over time. This suggests a balanced approach consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a need for immediate policy adjustments."
2,"The run-up in mortgage rates since the latter part of June was expected to curb housing demand to a limited extent in coming months, but the outlook for housing activity remained favorable, given an overall economic performance in line with current forecasts of a robust expansion, related growth in incomes, and still relatively attractive mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation that higher mortgage rates may slightly dampen housing demand but maintains a favorable outlook for housing activity due to a robust economic expansion and growth in incomes, along with relatively attractive mortgage interest rates. This suggests a balanced view, acknowledging a potential slowdown in one area (housing demand) but offset by positive economic factors. It does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it presents both a minor concern and positive expectations."
2,"In December, the consumer price index (CPI) rose somewhat faster than in recent months, primarily reflecting an upturn in consumer energy prices; core CPI inflation remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a slight increase in the consumer price index (CPI) due to energy prices, the core CPI inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—remained low. This suggests that the underlying inflationary pressures are stable, which does not clearly signal a need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might see the rise in CPI as transitory or not indicative of a broader inflationary trend, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
1,"The broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar rose nearly 3 percent over the intermeeting period amid the rise in U. S. interest rates, market expectations that U. S. tax reform was becoming more likely, and foreign central bank actions and communications.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic factors and their effects on the value of the dollar, rather than directly indicating a stance on the future direction of monetary policy. It mentions the rise in U.S. interest rates, which could be a result of previous policy decisions, and other factors such as U.S. tax reform and foreign central bank actions, which are not direct indicators of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. The sentence does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on economic conditions and market expectations."
2,"By 2009, the forecasts for both the headline and core PCE price indexes showed inflation receding from its 2008 level, in line with the previous forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of inflation trends, noting that inflation was receding from its previous year's level and aligning with forecasts. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a neutral assessment of past inflation data relative to expectations."
2,"In light of these significant policy actions, the risks to growth were now thought to be more closely balanced by the risks to inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the risks to economic growth and the risks to inflation as being more evenly matched following recent policy actions. This indicates a stance that is neither clearly leaning towards tightening nor easing monetary policy, but rather one that is balanced and responsive to current economic conditions. The FOMC appears to be weighing both sides of its dual mandate—supporting economic growth while keeping inflation in check—without a clear bias towards one or the other."
2,"In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will make decisions on the timing and size of adjustments to the federal funds rate based on how actual and expected economic conditions compare to its goals of maximum employment and a symmetric 2 percent inflation target. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather communicates a balanced approach that will depend on future economic data. It reflects a commitment to adjusting policy as needed to achieve its dual mandate, without a current bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members' assessments of the economic outlook have not significantly changed since their previous meeting. This suggests that they are maintaining their current stance on monetary policy rather than signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced view without a clear indication of a shift in policy, which aligns with a neutral stance."
0,"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, had continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core PCE inflation rates are running below the Committee's 2 percent target. This suggests that inflation is not a current concern and may imply that there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so to stimulate inflation towards the target level. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it suggests a potential for easing monetary policy to achieve the desired inflation rate."
0,"Particularly in light of persistent low readings on inflation and from indicators of inflation expectations along with the risks to the U. S. outlook associated with global economic developments, he noted that a policy rate reduction at the current meeting would help re-center inflation and inflation expectations at levels consistent with the Committee's symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and simultaneously provide some insurance against unexpected developments that could slow U. S. economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for easing monetary policy by suggesting a policy rate reduction. This action is proposed in response to persistently low inflation and subdued inflation expectations, as well as to mitigate risks from global economic developments. The aim is to steer inflation back towards the Committee's 2% target and to provide a safeguard against potential slowdowns in U.S. economic growth. This stance is dovish as it leans towards stimulating the economy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee expects to provide policy accommodation to support moderate economic growth and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate. This suggests an easing of monetary policy to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, aligning with a dovish stance. The use of ""appropriate policy accommodation"" implies measures to stimulate the economy, which is typically associated with lower interest rates or other expansionary monetary policies."
2,"The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is focused on monitoring inflation and inflation expectations, suggesting a readiness to adjust policy if inflation persists. This vigilance against inflation is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"Financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that financial conditions, including rising stock values and the availability of credit, are supportive of continued growth in consumer spending. This implies that the economy is strong, which could lead to inflationary pressures if not counteracted by a tightening of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider these conditions as a reason to raise interest rates or take other actions to prevent the economy from overheating, in line with their goal of stable prices."
0,"Others indicated that because part of the recent decline in the jobless rate was associated with a reduction in labor force participation, the drop in the unemployment rate likely overstated the overall improvement in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a nuanced view of the labor market, suggesting that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect the labor market's health due to a decrease in labor force participation. This analysis does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to the complexity of interpreting labor market indicators. It shows the Committee's careful consideration of various factors affecting employment, which is one of their key mandates, without a clear bias towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the types of assets that investors are holding, with an increased preference for retail money market mutual funds, which are considered safe and liquid. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather reflects investor behavior in response to economic conditions. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC, as it does not specifically address inflation pressures or employment levels."
2,The behavior of inflation had been unexpectedly benign for an extended period of time for reasons that were not fully understood.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation has remained low for a longer period than anticipated and the reasons for this trend are not entirely clear. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy since inflation is not posing a significant threat to the stability of prices, which is one of the FOMC's main goals. The absence of inflationary pressures would typically lead to a dovish stance, where the FOMC might maintain or reduce interest rates to support employment and economic growth, as long as inflation remains below their target level."
0,"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the combination of increasing productivity and moderate wage gains is expected to keep unit labor costs low, which in turn supports a forecast for subdued inflation. This implies that there is less pressure on the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, as the current economic conditions seem to be contributing to a stable price environment. The use of the word ""promising"" in relation to the outlook for subdued inflation indicates a positive view of the current situation, which aligns with a dovish stance that does not necessitate immediate action to raise interest rates or otherwise tighten monetary policy."
2,Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Foreign economic growth declined in the second quarter"" is a statement of fact regarding economic conditions abroad and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's domestic policy actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate, employment, or inflation targets. The sentence merely acknowledges an external economic development that the FOMC might consider in its comprehensive assessment of risks and policy adjustments."
0,"The several extensions of emergency unemployment insurance benefits appeared to have raised the measured unemployment rate, relative to levels recorded in past downturns, by encouraging some who have lost their jobs to remain in the labor force.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the impact of policy measures on labor market statistics without directly suggesting a future course of monetary policy action. It indicates that emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have influenced the unemployment rate by affecting labor force participation, but it does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus is on understanding the labor market dynamics rather than prescribing a policy response."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on maintaining an accommodative policy stance to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish approach. It emphasizes the importance of keeping monetary policy easy, particularly when the federal funds rate is close to its effective lower bound, to support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a preference for easing rather than tightening monetary policy to maintain economic momentum and credibility in the new policy framework."
1,"Participants generally expected that, over the medium term, real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the Committee's objective of maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants expect economic activity to grow at a pace that will gradually reduce unemployment, aligning with the Committee's employment goals. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys an expectation of continued progress toward their objectives. The use of ""further gradual decline"" implies a steady approach without signaling a shift in policy stance."
1,Home prices continued to rise briskly.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Home prices continued to rise briskly"" suggests that there is strong upward pressure on the housing market, which can be a sign of inflationary pressures in the economy. Rising home prices can contribute to overall inflation, which the FOMC may need to counteract by tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in line with their target. This could involve increasing interest rates to cool down the housing market and prevent the economy from overheating."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives, without indicating a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"It was generally agreed that developments relating to energy would continue to exert upward pressure on prices over the near term, including the passthrough or indirect effects of higher oil prices on core measures of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about rising inflationary pressures due to higher energy and oil prices, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these pressures and maintain their inflation target. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"Labor market conditions had improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate; taken as a whole, labor market indicators suggested that the underutilization of labor resources was continuing to diminish.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is showing signs of strength, with solid job gains and a decreasing unemployment rate, suggesting a reduction in the underutilization of labor resources. This improvement in labor market conditions could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which might prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The focus on diminishing underutilization aligns with the goal of maximum employment, one of the FOMC's key objectives, and suggests that the economy is moving closer to this goal, which could reduce the need for an accommodative policy stance."
0,"They generally judged that risks to the growth outlook, including strains in global financial markets, were significant and tilted to the downside; moreover, slow growth left the recovery more vulnerable to negative shocks.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential negative impacts on economic growth, suggesting that the FOMC might be inclined to implement or maintain an easing monetary policy stance to counteract these risks and support the recovery. This dovish stance aligns with the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, especially when growth is perceived as slow and the recovery is seen as vulnerable."
0,"Subsequently, the expected future path of monetary policy dropped amid increasing concerns about the health of financial institutions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that expectations for the future path of monetary policy have shifted towards a more accommodative stance due to rising concerns about the health of financial institutions. This suggests a potential easing of policy to support the financial sector and, by extension, the broader economy, which aligns with a dovish approach."
1,The staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loosened further.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that in the leveraged loan market, risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loosened further, which suggests an increase in risk-taking and potentially more borrowing at cheaper rates. This could lead to inflationary pressures if not monitored or controlled, implying that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Tightening would be consistent with a hawkish stance to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's main goals."
1,"With appropriate firming in the stance of monetary policy, participants expected inflation to return to the Committee's 2 percent objective over time and the labor market to remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants expect that a tightening (""firming"") of monetary policy will be appropriate to bring inflation back to the Committee's 2 percent target while maintaining a strong labor market. This suggests a bias towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period, even after the conclusion of the asset purchase program and as the economic recovery gains strength. This suggests a commitment to easing monetary policy to support employment and stabilize prices, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating economic growth and employment over concerns of potential inflation that might result from such accommodative measures."
2,"While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a contraction in bank lending, which could be seen as a negative factor for economic growth, the overall financial market conditions are still supportive of growth. This suggests a balance between a negative and a positive economic indicator, which does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might view the contraction in bank lending as a concern but also take comfort in the supportive financial market conditions, leading to a neutral stance in this context."
0,"The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt, GSE-guaranteed MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is directing the purchase of government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) debt, GSE-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and longer-term Treasury securities. This action is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. The aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity suggests that the FOMC is taking measures to ease monetary policy in order to support employment and stabilize prices, consistent with a dovish stance. This is particularly relevant when the economy is facing downturns or when inflation is below the Committee's long-term target of 2%."
2,The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) primary tool for adjusting monetary policy—the target range for the federal funds rate—but does not indicate a direction of policy change (tightening or easing). It simply states the mechanism the Committee uses to influence monetary conditions, which is consistent with their standard approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not provide information on whether they are currently inclined to raise, lower, or maintain interest rates, thus it is considered a neutral statement regarding policy stance."
1,One member was persuaded that policy had already become so expansionary that further easing ran an unacceptable risk of exacerbating inflation over time.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that a member of the FOMC believes the current monetary policy is already very expansionary (implying low interest rates and/or other forms of monetary stimulus) and that further easing could lead to an increase in inflation. This concern about potential inflation suggests a preference for tightening monetary policy or at least not introducing additional easing measures, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, indicating no significant change in the economic conditions or outlook that would warrant a change in monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent tightening or easing of policy, but rather implies a steady state of affairs consistent with the previous assessment."
2,House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""House price appreciation appeared to have slowed from the elevated rates seen over the past summer"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an observation on the housing market, suggesting that the rapid increase in house prices has moderated. This could be interpreted as a sign of cooling in the housing market, which might alleviate some inflationary pressures without necessarily implying immediate action by the FOMC. It does not explicitly suggest a need to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Stock prices in the basic materials and industrial sectors underperformed the broader market, reportedly reflecting an increase in trade tensions with China.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation related to stock prices in specific sectors and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both a negative factor (a spike in energy prices eroding real income growth) and a positive factor (solid gains in wages and salaries), which suggests a balanced view of economic conditions. It does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of different economic indicators that could have offsetting effects on the economy. The FOMC might consider these factors in the context of their dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy direction."
0,"However, energy prices were expected to level out, and rents, while difficult to forecast, were viewed by some participants as likely to decelerate in coming quarters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates expectations about future price developments for specific sectors (energy and housing), but it does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The expectation that energy prices will level out and rents may decelerate could imply that inflation pressures might ease, but the sentence also reflects uncertainty, especially regarding the forecast for rents. This uncertainty and the lack of a clear direction towards tightening or easing suggest a balanced or neutral stance."
2,"The considerable monetary ease already in place, the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus, the continuing strong gains in structural productivity, and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there are multiple factors (monetary ease, fiscal stimulus, productivity gains, and improved business confidence) that are expected to provide a strong boost to spending. This could lead to increased inflationary pressures, which might require the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The mention of ""considerable monetary ease"" implies that the current policy is already accommodative, and the anticipation of ""significant impetus to spending"" could necessitate a shift towards a more hawkish stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Moreover, the expected strength in aggregate demand would curb the extent of disinflation over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC anticipates strong aggregate demand, which could limit the degree of disinflation, implying a potential concern for inflationary pressures. This expectation might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone, with potential spillovers to U. S. financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader U. S. economy; a larger-than-expected U. S. fiscal tightening; and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes potential risks to the U.S. economy from external factors, such as issues in the euro zone, U.S. fiscal policy, and global economic growth. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather outlines concerns that could affect the economic outlook and influence future policy decisions. The FOMC may adjust its policy in response to these risks, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific direction of policy change."
0,"Although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer, it remains elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been some improvement in the unemployment rate, it is still higher than desired. This suggests that the FOMC might not be inclined to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively based on this information alone. The statement is simply providing an update on the employment situation without a clear direction on future monetary policy actions. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but does not explicitly suggest any immediate policy adjustments, hence the classification as neutral."
1,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee perceives ongoing risks of inflation, which suggests a concern that inflation could be higher than their target. This perception often leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation are low and that longer-term inflation expectations have not significantly changed. This suggests that there is no clear pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone. The statement reflects an observation of current conditions without a clear directional bias, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"Over the medium term, participants expected strong growth in employment, driven by continued progress on vaccinations and an associated rebound of economic activity and of consumer and business confidence, as well as accommodative fiscal and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of strong employment growth due to various factors, including progress on vaccinations, a rebound in economic activity and confidence, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy stance but rather provides an outlook that is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The mention of ""accommodative fiscal and monetary policy"" indicates that current policies are supportive of this growth, but it does not signal a shift towards either tightening or easing."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of strengthening household demand due to increased equity prices and fiscal policy support, which does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a commitment to adjust monetary policy in response to those conditions. The statement is balanced, acknowledging factors that could lead to economic growth without suggesting immediate action by the FOMC."
2,The available data for October suggested that the contribution of the change in net exports to real GDP growth in the fourth quarter would be much less negative than the drag of nearly 2 percentage points in the third quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic data regarding net exports and their impact on real GDP growth, without directly suggesting a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It indicates an improvement in the trade balance component of GDP but does not explicitly relate this to the FOMC's stance on monetary policy adjustments. The sentence merely provides an economic update, which could be used to inform policy decisions, but does not in itself advocate for a particular policy direction."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives, but does not indicate whether the policy stance will be tightened, eased, or remain the same. The directive to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions in the SOMA (System Open Market Account) is a standard operational procedure and does not inherently suggest a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"A number of participants noted that continued high unemployment, particularly with large numbers of workers suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead to an erosion of workers' skills that would have adverse consequences for those workers and for the economy's potential level of output in the longer term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for high unemployment and its long-term negative effects on the economy, suggesting that the FOMC might favor policies that support employment, even at the risk of higher inflation in the short term. This aligns with a dovish stance, which typically involves keeping interest rates lower to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment."
2,Real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is rapid growth in spending on office and computing equipment, with prices for certain types of equipment falling. This information alone does not clearly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about a particular sector of the economy, without providing direct insight into the FOMC's stance on inflation or employment levels. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of adjusting the federal funds rate or altering its monetary policy stance."
0,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to using the Federal Reserve's tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to implement measures that could ease monetary policy in order to promote employment and price stability. This is particularly dovish as it implies a focus on stimulating the economy during a challenging time, which often involves lowering interest rates or other expansionary monetary actions."
1,"In these circumstances, the Committee believed that some further measured policy firming was likely to be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee believes additional tightening of monetary policy (""measured policy firming"") is likely necessary to maintain a balance between sustainable economic growth and price stability. This suggests a stance towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish monetary policy approach."
0,"Low readings on overall and core consumer price inflation in recent months, as well as the weakened economic outlook, kept near-term inflation expectations reported in surveys well below their high levels in mid-2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core consumer price inflation are low and that near-term inflation expectations have decreased, which suggests there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Additionally, the mention of a weakened economic outlook implies that there may be a need to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate growth and employment."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments. ""","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the increase in inflation is expected to be temporary and is contingent on the stability of oil and other commodity prices. It also implies that there is slack in labor and product markets, which indicates underutilization of resources. This context suggests that there is no immediate need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, as the pressures are not seen as lasting. The FOMC may be more inclined to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment and economic activity, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"In that vein, several participants noted that inflation expectations had been sensitive to incoming data and to communications regarding monetary policy over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations are responsive to new information and the communication from the FOMC, but it does not explicitly suggest a direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing). It reflects an observation about market perceptions without committing to a particular policy action."
2,European equity prices were also lower over the period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""European equity prices were also lower over the period"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is merely a statement of fact regarding market conditions and does not reflect a policy inclination towards achieving maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates. It does not suggest any particular action the FOMC might take in response to these market conditions."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of positive aspects like employment conditions and household net worth could be seen as supportive of economic growth, while the reference to limiting factors indicates awareness of potential economic headwinds. This balanced perspective does not clearly signal a move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Some business contacts indicated that wage and price pressures were subdued; however, in one District, contacts pointed to rising wage pressures and labor shortages.","NEUTRAL

The sentence presents a mixed view of the economic conditions, with some business contacts observing subdued wage and price pressures, while others in a different District notice rising wage pressures and labor shortages. This indicates that there is no clear consensus or dominant trend across the board that would suggest a strong move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might see this as a signal to maintain its current stance until a clearer picture of the overall economic situation emerges."
1,"Looking ahead, an abatement or reversal of some of the temporary factors reducing prices was likely to raise measured inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise due to the end or reversal of temporary factors that were keeping prices low. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,"In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had increased from very low levels, and house prices appeared to be stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations in the residential real estate sector, noting improvements in home sales and construction, as well as stabilization in house prices. This information is indicative of a sector-specific development and does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a neutral stance as it simply reports on economic conditions without implying a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Moreover, a change in the ranges might be misinterpreted as a signal of greater reliance on the broad monetary aggregates in the formulation and conduct of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for misinterpretation of policy signals related to the use of broad monetary aggregates, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a concern about communication and the perception of policy rather than a direct policy stance."
0,"The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) expects economic activity to grow at a moderate pace and labor market indicators to improve with gradual adjustments in monetary policy. This suggests a balanced approach to policy adjustments, aiming to foster both parts of the dual mandate—supporting economic growth and a strong labor market—without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. The use of ""gradual adjustments"" implies a careful and measured approach to changing the policy stance, which is consistent with a neutral position."
2,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance towards tightening or easing but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. It suggests a balanced view without a clear direction towards either more aggressive or more accommodative monetary policy actions."
1,"Without a reduction of aggregate demand growth, inflation would rise.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if aggregate demand growth is not curtailed, inflation is expected to increase. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to reduce demand growth and prevent a rise in inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that focuses on controlling inflation even if it might slow down economic growth."
0,"Reinforcing this outlook was recent evidence of somewhat faster than anticipated productivity growth, the prospect that world economic conditions would hold down energy prices, and a sharp drop in near-term inflation expectations of households as reported in recent surveys.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that productivity is growing faster than expected, global economic conditions might suppress energy prices, and household inflation expectations have decreased. These factors generally point to lower inflationary pressures, which could mean there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. Therefore, the stance is dovish, as it implies a potential for easing or less aggressive tightening of monetary policy."
2,"In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to remove a statement about risks to growth and inflation, suggesting that they no longer see those risks as pressing or relevant. This does not directly imply an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment that the previous concerns are no longer a factor in their policy considerations. It suggests a balanced view where the risks to their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices are not currently skewed in one direction or the other."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that employment gains were stronger than expected, which could suggest that the economy is heating up and potentially creating inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
2,"Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants believe the low inflation readings are temporary, as indicated by the Dallas Fed's trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation remaining near the 2% target. This implies confidence in inflation returning to the target level, which could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation expectations anchored."
2,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation are low, but longer-term inflation expectations have not significantly changed. This suggests that there is no clear pressure to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The statement reflects an observation of current conditions without a strong indication of future policy moves, thus it is considered neutral in terms of monetary policy stance. It acknowledges the current state of inflation expectations, which is a key consideration for the FOMC when deciding on monetary policy adjustments to achieve its goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
0,"Inflation had increased somewhat since earlier this year but remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is below the Committee's 2 percent target, suggesting that there is room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even become more so in order to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the target level. The reference to low inflation due to factors like energy prices and import costs implies that there is less immediate concern about overheating, which would typically prompt a tightening of policy. Thus, the stance is more aligned with easing than with tightening."
0,"Measures of core inflation remained much more subdued, although they also moved up in some countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of inflation trends without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It acknowledges a slight increase in core inflation but also characterizes it as ""subdued,"" which does not strongly suggest imminent policy tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish). It reflects an awareness of inflation developments, which is consistent with the FOMC's mandate to monitor price stability, but it does not imply a specific policy action."
2,Inflation expectations that currently appeared by various measures and survey results to be essentially flat or even to have declined a bit were reinforcing the factors holding down price increases.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations are stable or slightly decreasing, which suggests that there is less pressure on prices to rise. This could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate threat of inflation."
2,Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months"" indicates that there has been stability in the public's expectations for inflation over the longer term. This suggests that there is neither increased concern about rising inflation that would warrant a hawkish response, nor is there a significant drop in expectations that might suggest deflationary pressures and a dovish response. The statement reflects a situation where the FOMC might not see an immediate need to adjust its policy stance significantly in either direction, as long-term inflation expectations are stable and aligned with their target."
0,"Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding municipal bond spreads and investor demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather reports on financial market conditions."
1,"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a factual statement about the increase in consumer prices as measured by the PCE price index but does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide context on whether this increase is above or below the Committee's inflation target of 2%. Without additional information on the FOMC's interpretation of this data point in relation to their goals, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish."
0,"Residential construction activity remained at a high level, evidently supported in part by recent declines in mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a current economic condition where residential construction activity is strong, partially due to lower mortgage interest rates. This observation does not directly indicate a future policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the housing market and its relationship with interest rates, without suggesting a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might view this as a positive development towards their goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members perceive significant risks to the economic outlook and believe that lowering interest rates would serve as a precaution against potential economic downturns. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support economic activity, aligning with a dovish approach."
0,"Indeed, financial services firms had already announced layoffs, largely reflecting mortgage market developments, the demand for temporary workers appeared to have softened, and the most recent weakening in construction employment was likely to continue for a while.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates signs of a weakening economy, with layoffs in financial services, reduced demand for temporary workers, and a continued decline in construction employment. These factors suggest that the economy might be slowing down, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of these negative trends implies that there may be less concern about inflationary pressures and more focus on stimulating economic activity, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,"Although many participants remained concerned about downside risks attending the outlook for inflation, a majority of participants saw the risks to the outlook for inflation as balanced.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is concern about potential lower-than-expected inflation (downside risks), the majority view is that the risks to the inflation outlook are evenly balanced. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a clear need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on inflation expectations alone, as the risks are not skewed in one direction. The use of the term ""balanced"" reflects a stance that is neither particularly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather one that maintains the current policy stance while continuing to monitor economic indicators."
1,"Participants discussed several risks that, if realized, could necessitate a steeper path of increases in the target range; these risks included the possibility that inflation pressures could build unduly if output expanded well beyond its maximum sustainable level, perhaps owing to fiscal stimulus or accommodative financial market conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation pressures might rise significantly if the economy grows too quickly, potentially due to fiscal stimulus or easy financial conditions. This suggests that the FOMC might consider a more aggressive series of interest rate increases to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy."
2,"However, other measures of labor utilization--including the labor force participation rate and the numbers of discouraged workers and those working part time for economic reasons--suggested more modest improvement, and other indicators of labor demand, such as rates of hiring and quits, remained low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite some improvements in labor utilization, there are still signs of underutilization in the labor market, such as low labor force participation, high numbers of discouraged workers, and many part-time workers who would prefer full-time work. Additionally, low rates of hiring and quits suggest that labor demand is not strong. This could imply that there is less pressure on wages and inflation, and therefore, there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to cool down the economy. The FOMC might maintain or introduce more accommodative measures to support employment, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies an expectation of slow economic growth, which typically leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance. In this context, sluggish growth in final demand suggests that there may be less pressure on inflation and that the FOMC might consider easing policies to stimulate demand and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance."
1,"The members generally agreed that, if necessary, their concerns about rising inflation could be addressed at the meeting in early February.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are prepared to take action to address concerns about rising inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy, such as raising interest rates. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, as it aims to curb inflationary pressures to maintain stable prices, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that wage trends are not contributing to inflationary pressures, which implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This dovish stance indicates a potential for maintaining or easing the current monetary policy rather than tightening it, as there is no evidence from wage trends that would necessitate a more aggressive approach to controlling inflation."
2,"More broadly, signs of a pickup in growth in economic activity in some AFEs and emerging Asian economies other than China also appeared to contribute to the improvement in sentiment in financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically noting an improvement in growth and sentiment in financial markets in certain advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging Asian economies, excluding China. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's decision-making. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"However, a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending, cautioning that household income growth remained slow, that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting, or that households' scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the translation of higher household wealth into consumer spending, noting several factors that might limit this effect. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to uncertainties in the economic outlook. The FOMC is acknowledging potential risks to consumer spending without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment. This reflects a balanced approach, considering the interplay between household income growth, consumer spending, and the broader economic conditions, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects real GDP growth to increase slowly, with the support of accommodative monetary policy, which typically means lower interest rates and other measures to stimulate economic activity. This suggests a stance towards easing rather than tightening, in line with a dovish approach to support growth and employment."
1,"Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Job gains had been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low"" indicates that the labor market is performing well, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of current economic conditions without a clear direction on future policy moves. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL, as it reflects a balanced view of one aspect of the dual mandate without indicating a change in policy stance."
1,"In particular, investors noted that the Committee attributed some of the recent increase in inflation to transitory factors, retained its earlier balance of risks assessment, and reiterated its belief that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee acknowledges the recent increase in inflation and suggests a gradual removal of policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases. The use of ""measured"" implies a cautious but deliberate approach to tightening monetary policy to address inflation, aligning with the goal of maintaining stable prices. This stance is consistent with a hawkish view, as it focuses on controlling inflation, one of the key objectives of the FOMC."
0,"In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain the federal funds rate at a very low level due to low rates of resource utilization and a subdued inflation outlook. This suggests that the FOMC is prioritizing support for the economy over concerns about inflation, which is consistent with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic growth and employment. The commitment to keeping rates low for an extended period also signals a willingness to provide ongoing monetary accommodation."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a readiness to adjust monetary policy in response to emerging risks but does not specify a direction of adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement is consistent with a neutral stance, as it suggests a conditional response to future economic conditions rather than a current commitment to a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee plans to make further gradual adjustments to tighten monetary policy. The expectation that economic activity will continue to expand and labor market conditions will remain strong suggests that the FOMC is confident in the economy's resilience to withstand tighter monetary policy, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance. This approach aligns with the FOMC's goals of maintaining stable prices and maximum employment, as it implies a response to potential inflationary pressures while the labor market remains robust."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants believe tightening monetary policy is appropriate to address inflation concerns. The use of ""firming of the stance of monetary policy"" suggests an inclination towards raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures. This aligns with the goal of maintaining price stability and keeping inflation at the Committee's 2 percent longer-run target, which is typically achieved through more restrictive monetary policy measures."
2,"In Latin America, indicators suggested that economic activity in Mexico and Brazil expanded further in the first quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply providing an observation of economic conditions in Latin America, specifically in Mexico and Brazil, without indicating a clear direction for U.S. monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest any immediate implications for the FOMC's policy stance regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates in the United States."
2,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion among FOMC members about the uncertain relationship between the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation, as well as uncertainty regarding future productivity. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The members are acknowledging uncertainties in the economic outlook, which is consistent with a neutral stance where they are neither committing to a hawkish (tightening) nor a dovish (easing) policy action until more information becomes available."
2,The current range readily encompassed the growth rate seen likely to be associated with the members' forecasts for economic activity and prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the current monetary policy settings are aligned with the FOMC members' expectations for economic growth and inflation, suggesting that the current policy stance is appropriate for the forecasted conditions. It does not explicitly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather suggests a balance between the two, aiming to maintain the projected path of the economy."
0,"However, a few other participants pointed to the record of inflation consistently running below the Committee's 2 percent objective over recent years and expressed the concern that longer-run inflation expectations may have slipped below levels consistent with that objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent target, suggesting that some participants are worried about deflationary pressures or insufficient inflation. This concern implies that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to raise inflation to the target level, which is a dovish stance. It suggests that these participants might support easing policy to prevent inflation expectations from becoming anchored below the desired level, which could hinder the achievement of the FOMC's mandate for stable prices."
1,"Economic activity expanded in the second quarter, partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of economic conditions, noting that there has been growth in consumer spending and exports, which contributed to the expansion of economic activity in the second quarter. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide a clear signal about the Committee's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate. The statement is simply reporting on recent economic developments without suggesting a particular direction for monetary policy adjustments."
1,Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy quickly in response to signs of rising inflation. This stance aligns with a proactive approach to curbing inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish monetary policy that prioritizes price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
1,"As a result, most market interest rates rose somewhat in the period after the November 16 meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of market behavior following a meeting, noting that most market interest rates rose. This statement does not directly indicate a policy action or intent by the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply reports on market reactions, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, including expectations of future FOMC actions, economic data releases, or other non-monetary events. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the FOMC views this rise in interest rates as desirable or whether it will prompt a policy response."
1,"The federal funds rate averaged a little higher than the level expected with an unchanged policy stance, in part because of unexpectedly high demand for reserves in late July and early August.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of market conditions where the federal funds rate was higher than anticipated due to a temporary increase in demand for reserves, rather than indicating a deliberate change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It does not explicitly suggest a future tightening or easing of policy, but rather reports on an event that affected short-term interest rates."
0,"Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both total and core inflation rates are expected to remain below the FOMC's 2% target, despite a slight projected increase. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not a current concern, aligning with a dovish stance that would support maintaining or easing the policy to stimulate the economy and move inflation towards the target rate."
0,"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members expect unemployment to stay high and inflation to remain below the Federal Reserve's long-term target for the next few years. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce policies that stimulate economic activity to address unemployment and move inflation towards the target rate, which aligns with a dovish stance on monetary policy."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October"" is a factual statement about employment trends without a clear indication of a policy stance. It neither explicitly suggests a need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy. The increase in employment could be seen as a positive sign towards achieving maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals, but without additional context on inflation or how the FOMC plans to respond, the stance remains neutral."
2,Members commented that the continued strong increases in energy and other commodity prices would prompt a difficult adjustment process involving both lower growth and higher rates of inflation in the near term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising energy and commodity prices leading to higher inflation and lower growth. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates to temper inflationary pressures, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, one of its key mandates."
0,"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are looking for further improvement in the labor market before considering a reduction in the pace of asset purchases. Asset purchases are typically used to stimulate the economy by lowering long-term interest rates, supporting more borrowing and spending. The fact that they are not ready to slow these purchases suggests a stance towards maintaining or increasing monetary stimulus, which is consistent with a dovish policy approach. This approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, as they are indicating a need for ongoing support for the labor market."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is considering a reduction in the nominal federal funds rate to counteract the increase in the real federal funds rate that has resulted from a recent decline in inflation. This action suggests a move towards easing monetary policy, as the FOMC is looking to adjust the nominal rate to maintain the real rate at a level that supports their goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Lowering the nominal rate in response to lower inflation is consistent with a dovish stance, as it aims to stimulate the economy by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging spending and investment."
0,"The staff continued to project that the accommodative stance of monetary policy, together with a further attenuation of financial stress, the waning of adverse effects of earlier declines in wealth, and improving household and business confidence, would support a moderate recovery in economic activity and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate over the next two years.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects the current accommodative (easing) stance of monetary policy to contribute to a moderate economic recovery and a gradual decline in unemployment. This suggests that the policy is aimed at stimulating the economy, which aligns with a dovish approach that typically involves lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and investment."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of stronger real GDP growth due to various supportive factors, including fiscal policy changes, confidence levels, credit availability, financial conditions, and foreign economic growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The statement is balanced and does not suggest a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the intermeeting period, Committee members agreed that keeping the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent would be appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have agreed to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, which suggests that they are neither looking to tighten (which would be hawkish) nor ease (which would be dovish) monetary policy at this time. This decision reflects a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making any changes to the policy stance."
0,"Participants also observed that crude oil prices fell over the intermeeting period and other commodity prices also moderated, developments that were likely to damp headline inflation at the consumer level going forward.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that participants observed a decrease in crude oil and other commodity prices, which is expected to reduce headline inflation at the consumer level. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth, as there may be less need for tightening to control inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, where the focus might shift towards supporting maximum employment and economic activity, given that inflation is showing signs of moderation."
2,"Some saw a risk that inflationary pressures might develop more rapidly than currently anticipated as resource utilization tightened, while several others thought that progress in achieving the Committee's inflation objective might lag if further appreciation of the dollar continued to depress non-energy commodity prices or if inflation was slow to respond to tighter resource utilization.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflationary pressures could rise more quickly than expected due to tightening resource utilization. This suggests that some members of the FOMC are considering the possibility of tightening monetary policy to prevent an overshoot of their inflation target. The mention of the risk of inflation rising faster implies a readiness to act against potential inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"This policy preference was based on expectations of growth in business activity at a pace averaging in the vicinity of the economy's potential, a perception among the members that the risks to such an outlook were more balanced than earlier, and anticipations that under these circumstances inflation would remain constrained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting growth in business activity to align with the economy's potential and inflation to remain constrained. The mention of risks being more balanced than earlier suggests that there is no clear inclination towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The Committee seems to be maintaining its current stance, with no immediate need to adjust policy aggressively in either direction to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail of their policy framework rather than a direct indication of a change in policy stance. The setting of these ranges is part of their regular monetary policy operations and does not inherently signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a commitment to their long-term objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without indicating a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish position."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain very low for an extended period. This type of communication strategy is typically used to reassure markets and the public that the Committee is committed to an accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity. By signaling that short-term rates will stay low, the Committee is indicating a dovish stance, as it implies a policy of easing rather than tightening. This would be consistent with efforts to stimulate the economy, support maximum employment, and return inflation to the Committee's 2% target, especially if current inflation rates are below that level or if there are concerns about economic growth or employment shortfalls."
0,"Indeed, most anticipated that inflation will slow for a time to rates somewhat lower than those they judge consistent with the dual goals of price stability and maximum employment, initially reflecting the recent declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and later responding to several years of substantial economic slack.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to decrease to levels below the FOMC's target, which is associated with price stability and maximum employment. The anticipated slowdown in inflation is attributed to recent declines in energy and commodity prices, as well as a period of significant economic slack. This outlook implies that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not seen as a current threat, and there may be room for easing to support employment without risking the FOMC's price stability goal."
2,"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core consumer price indices have not risen significantly, suggesting that inflation pressures are not escalating. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current policy to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate threat of high inflation."
2,"In Japan, private consumption rebounded strongly, and private investment and net exports continued to boost growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in Japan, specifically noting positive trends in private consumption, private investment, and net exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments or signal a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides context on international economic developments, which may be one of many factors considered by the FOMC when making policy decisions. However, without a direct link to U.S. monetary policy actions or implications for the U.S. economy, the sentence remains neutral in terms of policy stance."
1,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is experiencing strong growth, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, strong economic growth might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"The producer price index for core intermediate materials dropped for a fifth month in February, reflecting, in part, weaker global demand and steep declines in the prices of a wide variety of energy-intensive goods, such as chemicals and plastics.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a decline in the producer price index for core intermediate materials, which suggests a reduction in inflationary pressures, particularly in the cost of goods that are energy-intensive. This decrease in prices could be a result of weaker global demand, which may not necessitate a tightening of monetary policy. Instead, it could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity, aligning with a dovish policy approach."
2,"Although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure, core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer-term inflation expectations remained contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the potential for inflationary pressures due to higher energy and other costs, which could suggest a hawkish stance if these pressures were deemed significant. However, it also notes that core inflation has been relatively low in the recent past and that longer-term inflation expectations are contained, which could imply a dovish stance if the FOMC believes these trends will continue. The combination of these two observations suggests a balanced view, indicating that the FOMC is neither clearly signaling an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy based on the information provided in the sentence. This balanced approach aligns with a neutral monetary policy stance, as the FOMC appears to be weighing the risks of inflation against observed trends and expectations."
2,One member anticipated little if any effect on economic growth and unemployment and did not agree that the outlook for economic activity and inflation called for further policy accommodation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that one member of the FOMC did not see the need for further policy accommodation because they did not expect any significant impact on economic growth and unemployment, and they did not agree with the assessment that the economic activity and inflation outlook warranted such action. This stance suggests a preference against easing monetary policy, which is typically considered a hawkish position. The member's view implies that the current policy might be sufficient to maintain the targeted goals of maximum employment and stable prices, or that there might be concerns about potential inflationary pressures that could arise from further accommodation."
0,"In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will take a comprehensive approach to assess the economic conditions before making a decision on the stance of monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the consideration of a wide range of economic indicators. This balanced approach is consistent with a neutral stance, as it implies that the FOMC is open to adjusting policy in either direction based on the incoming data."
1,"Pressures on labor resources were likely to ease somewhat as the expansion of economic activity slowed, but inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that while there may be a slight easing in labor market pressures as economic activity slows, inflation is expected to increase due to a rebound in energy prices. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from moving above the target level. The anticipation of inflationary pressures aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider measures to cool down inflation, such as raising interest rates."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that threaten its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and responsiveness to economic conditions, which is a neutral stance. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals, without a clear indication of moving in a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"That sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the August employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its ""soft patch. ""","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is recovering from a period of weakness, as indicated by the comments of Federal Reserve officials and the August employment report. This perception of economic improvement could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures that might arise from a stronger economy, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The use of the term ""soft patch"" implies that the period of weaker economic activity is ending, which could reduce the need for a dovish stance that supports further easing."
1,Mr. Broaddus dissented because he continued to believe that a modest tightening of policy would be prudent in light of the apparent persisting strength in aggregate demand for goods and services.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Broaddus believes a tightening of monetary policy (which usually means increasing interest rates) is necessary due to strong aggregate demand. This stance is consistent with a hawkish view, as it suggests a concern for potential inflationary pressures that could arise from robust demand, and thus a need to potentially cool down the economy to maintain price stability."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is slack in the economy, with resources not being fully utilized, which is expected to lead to a decrease in core price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is anticipated to moderate on its own due to underutilization. Therefore, the stance is dovish, indicating a potential for easing of monetary policy or at least no immediate need for tightening."
2,"Against this background, the members agreed on the need to continue to monitor the economy with care for signs either of a potential upturn in inflation or greater softness in the expansion than they were currently forecasting and to be prepared to respond promptly in either direction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the FOMC members expressing readiness to adjust policy in response to signs of either rising inflation or a weakening economic expansion. This suggests a stance that is neither explicitly geared towards tightening nor easing but rather emphasizes vigilance and flexibility in response to economic developments."
0,"This increase was slower than a year earlier, as core PCE price inflation (which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices) moved down to 1.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core PCE price inflation, which is a measure of underlying inflation that excludes volatile food and energy prices, has decreased compared to the previous year. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. A dovish stance typically involves maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern. In this case, the movement of core PCE price inflation towards or below the FOMC's long-term target of 2% could justify a dovish policy approach to stimulate the economy or maintain accommodative conditions to support maximum employment."
2,"Housing activity showed signs of dropping off from peak levels during the latter part of the summer, but the decline in mortgage rates this fall produced an upturn in several indicators of demand for single-family housing, including a rebound in a survey index of homebuying conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where housing activity decreased but then showed signs of improvement due to a decline in mortgage rates. This indicates a response to changing economic conditions rather than a clear direction in monetary policy. The FOMC might view the improvement as a positive sign for economic stability, but the sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic indicators without a direct implication for policy adjustments."
1,An upside risk was that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that inflation could rise more than anticipated in an economy growing beyond its potential, which implies a risk of overheating. This scenario would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and bring inflation back towards its 2% target."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a slight downward revision in the economic growth forecast, specifically mentioning a slowdown in construction. This does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions that could be part of the normal fluctuations in economic activity. The FOMC might use such information to maintain its current policy stance while continuing to monitor economic developments."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a mixed situation where job gains have slowed down, but the unemployment rate has not increased, suggesting neither a clear need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy. It reflects a situation where the FOMC might maintain the current policy stance while monitoring further economic developments."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the economy might be facing headwinds, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The extended period of weakness in the housing sector implies that there is less immediate concern for inflationary pressures that would necessitate a tightening of policy, hence the dovish classification."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices without suggesting immediate action to adjust the policy."
0,"Nonetheless, participants generally saw the unemployment rate as still elevated and were not yet confident that the recent progress toward the Committee's employment objective would be sustained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants view the unemployment rate as higher than desired and are uncertain about the persistence of recent improvements. This suggests a stance that is more inclined towards easing monetary policy to support further progress towards the goal of maximum employment, rather than tightening policy, which would be more likely if they were confident in the sustainability of employment gains."
1,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a wait-and-see approach, basing future policy decisions on incoming economic data related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a balanced stance where the Committee is neither committing to tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy without further evidence. They are open to adjusting policy as necessary to maintain their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but the direction of the adjustment is not indicated."
2,Participants commented that demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy and that their business contacts continued to report difficulties in hiring and retaining workers.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the demand for labor is exceeding the available supply, and businesses are facing challenges in hiring and retaining workers. This situation suggests that the labor market is tight, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, such conditions might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that labor costs, which are a component of overall inflation, have not been rising. This implies that there is less pressure on the FOMC to raise interest rates to combat inflation, as labor costs are a significant factor in the overall inflationary picture. A lack of upward movement in labor costs could be seen as a sign that there is less need for a tightening of monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance."
2,"In any case, however, the assessment of the adverse effects of the increase in longer-term rates on financial conditions and ultimately on economic activity would depend importantly upon the extent to which rates stabilized at current levels or instead continued to rise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a conditional stance, suggesting that the FOMC's assessment will depend on future movements of longer-term rates. It does not commit to either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates that the Committee will monitor the situation and adjust their assessment as necessary. This reflects a balanced approach, considering the potential impact of interest rate changes on the economy without indicating a predetermined direction for policy adjustments."
0,"With regard to the consensus in favor of moving from an assessment of risks weighted toward rising inflation to one that was weighted toward economic weakness, with no intermediate issuance of a balanced risks assessment, some members observed that such a change was likely to be viewed as a relatively rapid shift by some observers.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in focus from concerns about rising inflation to concerns about economic weakness. This suggests that the FOMC is more worried about a potential slowdown in economic activity than about inflation running too high. A stance that emphasizes the risks of economic weakness typically aligns with a dovish monetary policy, which may involve maintaining lower interest rates to support economic growth and employment. The absence of an intermediate balanced risk assessment further underscores the Committee's inclination towards addressing economic softness rather than inflationary pressures."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, showing that the FOMC is attentive to inflation trends, which is consistent with their mandate for stable prices. The commitment to monitoring suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed, but the sentence itself does not reveal a bias towards either increasing or decreasing the interest rate or implementing other monetary policy measures."
2,"Some uncertainties, such as those associated with the election, had been resolved, but others persisted, including the prospects for oil prices and their consequences for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resolution of certain uncertainties and the persistence of others, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It acknowledges factors that can affect the economy, such as election outcomes and oil prices, but does not suggest whether these factors would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The focus on uncertainties implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months driven by strong demand for workers.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that labor market conditions have improved due to strong demand for workers, which could suggest a tightening labor market. This improvement could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which might require a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and maintain the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a hawkish stance, as it implies conditions that could lead to policy actions aimed at preventing the economy from overheating."
2,"In their comments about the external sector of the economy, members referred to indications of strengthening economic activity abroad that in conjunction with a weaker dollar was fostering some improvement in exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where external economic factors are leading to an improvement in exports, which is generally positive for the U.S. economy. However, it does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The strengthening of economic activity abroad and a weaker dollar are both factors that can contribute to achieving the FOMC's goals, but the sentence does not specify any intended policy action in response to these observations. It simply provides an assessment of the current economic conditions related to the external sector."
1,The average rate of growth of CRE loans at banks continued to be strong in October and November.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The average rate of growth of CRE (Commercial Real Estate) loans at banks continued to be strong in October and November"" does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is simply a statement of fact regarding loan growth, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, including previous monetary policy decisions. However, without additional context on whether this growth is seen as positive or negative in light of the FOMC's goals for employment, inflation, and interest rates, it does not suggest a clear policy stance. It could potentially be associated with economic expansion (which might eventually lead to inflationary pressures if not monitored), but on its own, it does not convey a hawkish or dovish tilt."
1,Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Overall consumer prices increased in July and August at about the second-quarter rate"" does not explicitly indicate a change in the pace of inflation or a shift in monetary policy. It simply states that the rate of increase in consumer prices remained consistent with the previous quarter. This suggests that the FOMC might not see an immediate need to adjust its policy stance if the inflation rate is stable and close to their target, hence the classification as NEUTRAL. It does not imply a clear direction towards tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,"On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than-expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential sources of higher-than-expected inflationary pressures, such as bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and high rates of resource utilization. The mention of a possible significant rise in inflation expectations altering inflation dynamics suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too quickly, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This is because a hawkish policy stance is typically associated with measures to combat rising inflation, which may include increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine process of the FOMC, where participants submit their economic projections based on their assessments of appropriate monetary policy. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (neither tightening nor easing) but rather reflects the Committee's ongoing practice of reviewing economic conditions and outlooks to inform their policy decisions. The mention of projections for GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation, in conjunction with appropriate monetary policy, suggests a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"They also generally expected that inflation would remain, for some time, below levels the Committee considers most consistent, over the longer run, with maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members expect inflation to remain below the levels they associate with their dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability for some time. This suggests that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and move inflation towards the Committee's long-term target."
0,Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflationary pressures are being contained by weaker demand and lower oil prices, which suggests that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to support economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observed changes in yields and inflation compensation without directly indicating a future policy action or a clear stance on the direction of monetary policy. It simply reports on market movements, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, including market participants' expectations about inflation and economic growth. The statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is preparing to either tighten or ease monetary policy in response to these observations."
2,"Participants noted that the improved performance of investment suggested that the expansion was becoming more balanced, with strengthening business spending potentially offsetting some moderation in the growth of household spending from the elevated rates of recent years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the components of economic growth, with investment improving and potentially balancing out a moderation in household spending. This observation does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an assessment of economic conditions that could be consistent with a range of policy responses, depending on how these conditions interact with the FOMC's broader goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence suggests a balanced view of economic activity without a clear bias toward action in either direction."
0,"With the risks to the forecast for economic activity tilted to the downside, the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees both economic activity and inflation projections as having more downside risk. This suggests that there is concern about economic weakness and lower inflation, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy and move inflation towards the target level."
2,"These indicators suggested that the financial system was fairly resilient, as did the absence of a significant increase in funding stresses or margin calls earlier this year when prices of risky assets fell and volatility rose sharply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the resilience of the financial system in the face of increased volatility and falling asset prices, without directly suggesting a need for a change in monetary policy. It indicates that the system coped well with the conditions, which does not inherently call for either tightening or easing of policy."
1,"Job gains had remained solid, and the unemployment rate had stayed near its recent low.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the labor market is performing well, with solid job gains and a low unemployment rate, which is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, it does not directly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, as it does not comment on inflation or the need for adjustments to the current policy stance. It simply provides an assessment of the employment situation, which is one of the FOMC's key considerations."
0,"Overall inflation was projected to remain subdued, with the staff's forecasts for headline and core inflation little changed from the previous projection.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both headline and core inflation are expected to remain low, with no significant change from previous forecasts. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment."
0,"Consumer prices had edged up in recent months, but year-over-year consumer inflation remained at a very low level.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while there has been a slight increase in consumer prices recently, the overall annual inflation rate is still very low. This suggests that inflation is not a current concern and there may be less need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures. The FOMC might consider maintaining or even easing monetary policy to support economic activity, as long as inflation remains below their target level."
