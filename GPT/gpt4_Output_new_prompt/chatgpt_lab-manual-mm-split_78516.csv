2,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not anticipate a significant change in inflation, suggesting that they may not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The expectation of ""some slight further disinflation"" implies a small decrease in inflation rates, but since ""no one expected a material change in inflation,"" it suggests that the current policy stance could be maintained. This reflects a balanced view that does not clearly lean towards a more aggressive tightening (hawkish) or easing (dovish) of monetary policy."
2,"Moreover, current data suggested little or no growth in overall expenditures on nonresidential structures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a specific observation about economic conditions, particularly that there is little or no growth in expenditures on nonresidential structures. This statement does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides a neutral assessment of a segment of the economy. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators, but it does not in itself imply an immediate need for policy adjustment."
0,"However, the projected step-up in real GDP growth over the second half of this year was marked down a little, partly reflecting softer news on construction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a downward revision in the growth forecast for real GDP, which suggests a recognition of some economic softening, particularly in the construction sector. However, it does not directly imply an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The statement is simply an observation of economic conditions, which could be part of the ongoing assessment that informs policy decisions. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of economic indicators to balance risks and achieve its long-term goals."
2,"In contrast, Spanish economic activity stagnated in the third quarter, Greek GDP extended its decline, and more-recent indicators point to continued weakness in peripheral European economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes economic conditions in peripheral European economies, which is an observation of international economic performance rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates within the United States. The FOMC may consider such international economic conditions in its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy action."
1,"Later in the week, however, market interest rates moved up in response to the release of the minutes of the February meeting and the mention therein of some sentiment for a larger policy tightening than had been undertaken.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that market interest rates increased after the release of the FOMC minutes, which mentioned that some members had a sentiment for a larger policy tightening than what was executed. This suggests that there was a consideration or preference among some FOMC members for a more aggressive approach to tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish stance aiming to control inflation and stabilize prices, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
0,"however, apart from the energy and health care sectors, price inflation had remained relatively subdued, evidently reflecting the combination of diminished growth in overall demand and strong competitive pressures in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that, with the exception of the energy and health care sectors, price inflation has been relatively low, which is attributed to reduced growth in overall demand and strong competition in most markets. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not widespread and that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The subdued inflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests that there may be room for a more accommodative policy stance to support demand without risking a significant rise in inflation."
2,"Nevertheless, most participants agreed that, although the level of inventories of unsold homes that homebuilders desired was uncertain, the correction of the housing sector was likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year--somewhat longer than previously expected.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect the housing sector correction to negatively impact economic activity for a longer period than previously anticipated. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to maintain or introduce more accommodative monetary policy measures to support the economy through this extended period of weakness, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on a sectoral slowdown implies a concern for maintaining employment and economic stability, which dovish policies aim to address."
0,Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Participants expected that fiscal policy would continue to be a drag on economic growth over coming quarters"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an expectation regarding fiscal policy's impact on economic growth. This statement is more of an economic outlook rather than a clear indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either raise or lower interest rates or adjust its balance sheet policies in response to fiscal policy's impact on growth. Therefore, it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees no immediate need to tighten monetary policy because inflation is low and there is slack in resource utilization. This suggests a stance towards easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation, as there is no pressure to combat high inflation or overheating in the economy, which aligns with a dovish monetary policy stance."
1,Rapid increases in healthcare and other insurance costs and the lagged passthrough of large increases in oil prices would tend to maintain upward pressure on prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about persistent inflationary pressures stemming from rising healthcare, insurance, and oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract these inflationary forces and achieve its goal of stable prices, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,These rates of growth were associated with ranges for the civilian rate of unemployment of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 and 5 to 5-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing historical data on economic growth and unemployment rates without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's decision-making process."
1,"In the absence of such shocks, and assuming appropriate monetary policy, participants' economic projections generally showed growth picking up to a moderate pace and the unemployment rate declining somewhat next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that if there are no unexpected economic shocks and monetary policy is appropriate, the FOMC participants expect economic growth to increase moderately and unemployment to decrease slightly next year. This suggests a balanced view that does not explicitly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The use of ""appropriate monetary policy"" implies that the FOMC is aiming to maintain conditions that support their goals of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy stance."
1,"In their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook, meeting participants agreed that information received over the intermeeting period indicated that the labor market had continued to strengthen and that economic activity had been rising moderately so far this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of the economy, noting improvements in the labor market and moderate economic activity, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the economy's performance relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,The near-term forecast again entailed a marked downshift in headline inflation as energy prices fall back consistent with readings from futures markets.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of a decrease in headline inflation due to falling energy prices, as suggested by futures markets. This suggests that inflationary pressures are expected to ease, which could imply that there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. A dovish stance typically supports the idea of maintaining or reducing interest rates to stimulate economic activity when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"Major reasons for optimism about the outlook were the substantial easing in monetary policy, whose lagged effects would be felt increasingly in the year ahead, and the fiscal stimulus measures that already had been enacted and might well be supplemented over coming months.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a positive view on the economy due to recent easing in monetary policy and fiscal stimulus measures. The mention of ""substantial easing in monetary policy"" suggests that the FOMC has recently implemented policies to stimulate the economy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth. The expectation that the effects of these policies will be felt increasingly suggests that the FOMC anticipates that these measures will continue to support the economy in the future, without the need for immediate tightening."
2,"While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a contraction in bank lending, which could suggest a tightening of credit conditions or a cautious approach by banks (potentially HAWKISH), the overall financial market conditions are still favorable for economic growth, which implies that the financial environment is not restrictive (potentially DOVISH). The balance between these two observations suggests a neutral stance, as the FOMC does not signal a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy based on this information alone. The sentence reflects an acknowledgement of mixed signals in the economy, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance that neither clearly supports tightening nor easing."
2,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased, they are still low, and survey-based expectations for long-term inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests that the FOMC sees some signs of inflation but not enough to warrant a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance. The statement reflects an observation of the current economic indicators without a strong implication towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"The risks to the forecast for real GDP were seen as tilted to the downside, reflecting the staff's assessment that neither monetary nor fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks; the downside risks to the forecast of economic activity were seen as more pronounced than in December, mainly reflecting the greater uncertainty about global economic prospects and the financial market turbulence in the United States and abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential economic weakness and acknowledges that both monetary and fiscal policies may not be adequately prepared to counter significant negative events. The mention of downside risks to the GDP forecast, increased uncertainty about global economic prospects, and financial market turbulence suggests a cautious or dovish stance, as it implies that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support the economy in the face of these risks. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as easing monetary policy could help to mitigate the impact of adverse shocks on the economy."
1,"Looking ahead, however, members reiterated earlier concerns that aggregate demand could continue to grow faster than potential aggregate supply, even under optimistic assumptions regarding future productivity gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about aggregate demand growing faster than potential aggregate supply, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to curb inflation and maintain stable prices, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down economic growth to a sustainable level."
2,"In the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consider- ation to economic, financial, and monetary developments, a somewhat higher federal funds rate would or a slightly lower federal funds rate might be acceptable in the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, depending on economic, financial, and monetary developments. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, with the Committee willing to raise or lower rates as necessary to achieve its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth. The use of ""somewhat higher"" and ""slightly lower"" implies small adjustments rather than significant shifts in policy, reflecting a stance that is neither clearly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation about recent inflation trends, attributing them to specific factors (oil and gasoline prices), without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need for easing (which would be dovish). It simply states a cause for the recent pickup in inflation, which is part of the FOMC's monitoring but does not in itself dictate a policy response."
2,"Indeed, economic growth abroad was widely viewed as dependent to a significant extent on the performance of the U. S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a view on the relationship between U.S. economic performance and global economic growth, without directly indicating a stance on the adjustment of monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic interdependencies."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the types of assets that investors are holding, with an increased preference for retail money market mutual funds, which are considered safe and liquid. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather reflects investor behavior in response to economic conditions. It does not suggest an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it does not specifically address inflation pressures or employment levels. Instead, it provides context on the financial environment that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions."
0,"Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states the Federal Reserve's broad objectives without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather describes the overarching goals of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)."
0,"Financial conditions affecting emerging market economies continued to improve for a time after the Committee eased monetary policy at its November 17 meeting, but that trend was subsequently reversed after Brazil's legislature decided to reject a key fiscal reform measure.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of external political events on emerging market economies and does not directly indicate a change in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. It mentions that financial conditions improved after a policy easing but then reversed due to an unrelated legislative decision in Brazil. This does not suggest an inherent bias towards either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the influence of nonmonetary factors on global financial conditions."
0,"Even after adjusting for the effects of strikes on reported payrolls, the employment report for August showed weak job gains.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the employment report for August, even after adjusting for anomalies like strikes, showed weak job gains. This suggests that the labor market is not overheating and may be underperforming, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment growth. Weak job gains are typically a sign that there is less risk of inflation from an overheating economy, aligning with a dovish stance that favors easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and improve employment levels."
2,"For 1998, the Committee agreed on a tentative basis to set the same ranges as in 1997 for growth of the monetary aggregates and debt, measured from the fourth quarter of 1997 to the fourth quarter of 1998.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC decided to maintain the same growth ranges for the monetary aggregates and debt as the previous year, suggesting a continuation of the existing policy without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. This approach reflects a balanced stance, aiming to sustain the progress towards their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates without making adjustments based on the current economic conditions."
2,"In view of the most recent information on the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate for the post-meeting statement to characterize economic growth as apparently continuing to moderate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's assessment of economic growth as moderating, which does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of the current economic condition rather than a policy stance. The use of the word ""moderate"" suggests a balanced view of economic growth, which aligns with a neutral stance. The FOMC may be acknowledging a change in economic conditions without committing to a specific direction for future policy adjustments."
0,"A couple of participants pointed to the decline in credit spreads to relatively low levels by historical standards; one of these participants noted the risk of either a sharp rise in spreads, which could have negative repercussions for aggregate demand, or a continuation of the decline in spreads, which could undermine financial stability over time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes concerns about credit spreads and their potential impact on aggregate demand and financial stability. It does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a discussion of financial conditions and risks, which is part of the broader analysis the FOMC undertakes when considering policy decisions. The mention of both potential negative repercussions (from a sharp rise in spreads) and risks to financial stability (from a continuation of the decline in spreads) suggests a balanced view on the current situation, without a clear lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Even so, in the absence of major overhangs in inventories of business equipment and consumer durables, and given favorable conditions in financial markets, members believed that a resumption of moderate, sustainable growth after a relatively brief period of weakness was the most likely outlook for the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members have a balanced view of the economic outlook, expecting moderate and sustainable growth after a short period of weakness. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather conveys an expectation of economic stability. The mention of ""favorable conditions in financial markets"" and the absence of ""major overhangs in inventories"" implies that the current economic conditions do not warrant a significant change in policy stance. This reflects a neutral position in line with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift towards more aggressive inflation control (hawkish) or stimulus measures (dovish)."
2,Several participants noted the increase in agricultural crop prices over 2020 and the associated improvement in farm revenues.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of rising agricultural crop prices and an improvement in farm revenues, which does not directly indicate a clear stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is merely a statement of economic conditions without a specified policy response. This information could be used to assess economic conditions related to inflation and employment in the agricultural sector, but it does not in itself suggest an imminent change in monetary policy."
1,"Credit conditions in the commercial real estate (CRE) sector continued to ease, and growth in CRE loans at banks stayed solid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of credit conditions and loan growth in the commercial real estate sector without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that credit conditions have been easing and that there is solid growth in CRE loans, which does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy. This information could be used to assess economic conditions, but it does not in itself imply a change in the stance of monetary policy."
1,"The faster pace of real GDP growth was expected to be supported by an easing in the restraint from changes in fiscal policy, increases in consumer and business confidence, further improvements in credit availability and financial conditions, and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations of stronger real GDP growth due to various supportive factors, including fiscal policy changes, consumer and business confidence, credit availability, financial conditions, and foreign economic growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The statement is balanced and does not suggest a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Moreover, if, as some members thought likely, productivity growth slowed as employment picked up, the result could be reductions in slack accompanied by higher unit labor costs and associated pressures on prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members anticipate a scenario where increasing employment could lead to slower productivity growth, resulting in higher unit labor costs and potential upward pressure on prices. This implies a concern for rising inflation, which would typically warrant a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. Therefore, the stance is hawkish, as it leans towards actions that would prevent inflation from rising above the target level."
2,"Members referred, however, to a number of favorable factors that should continue to support at least moderate further growth in business investment, including the attractive pricing of and ongoing rapid technological improvements in computer and communications equipment and the wide availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms to business firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive outlook on business investment growth due to favorable factors such as attractive pricing, technological improvements, and the availability of financing. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on supportive factors for business investment suggests a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices, without signaling a clear move towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In particular, participants judged that communicating the Committee's expectation that short-term interest rates were likely to stay exceptionally low for some time could be useful because it could lead to pricing of longer-term interest rates consistent with the path of monetary policy that policymakers saw as most likely.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are considering communicating an expectation that short-term interest rates will remain exceptionally low for an extended period. This communication strategy is aimed at influencing the pricing of longer-term interest rates to align with the monetary policy path they deem most likely. Keeping interest rates low is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it suggests a policy geared towards stimulating economic activity by making borrowing cheaper, with the intention of supporting employment and avoiding deflationary pressures. This aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, particularly if there are concerns about economic weakness or below-target inflation."
0,"The lagged effects of the earlier rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing, though diminishing, restraint on the demand for U. S. exports for some period ahead and to lead to further substitution of imports for domestic products.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of how past changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar might affect trade dynamics, with a focus on exports and imports rather than directly indicating a future stance on monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of the dollar's value on economic conditions without suggesting an immediate policy response to either tighten or ease monetary conditions."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants believe tightening monetary policy is appropriate to address inflation concerns. The use of the term ""firming of the stance of monetary policy"" suggests that they are considering actions that would typically involve increasing interest rates or taking other measures to reduce liquidity in the economy. This is aimed at keeping inflation expectations stable and bringing actual inflation down to the Committee's target level, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes combating inflation even if it might slow down economic growth or increase unemployment in the short term."
2,"The staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, as it neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy. It simply reflects an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty, without a clear directional signal on policy actions."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to changing its monetary policy stance in response to emerging risks that threaten the achievement of its goals, which include maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate direction for policy adjustment (tightening or easing) but rather communicates a readiness to act in either direction as necessary to maintain its mandate. It reflects a balanced approach, contingent on future economic developments, and does not commit to a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"as before, core inflation was projected to be quite subdued at rates below last year's pace.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is expected to remain low and even below the previous year's levels. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or lowering interest rates to support economic growth and employment."
0,"Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee expects to use policy actions, including monetary stimulus, to support the economy and counteract a weak near-term economic outlook. The mention of monetary stimulus typically indicates a dovish stance, as it implies the use of policy tools to encourage economic growth, which may include lowering interest rates or other measures to increase liquidity in the financial system. This approach is consistent with a dovish policy aimed at supporting employment and stabilizing prices when economic conditions are not strong."
2,Members agreed that they would continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members plan to keep a close watch on inflation and global economic conditions without specifying a direction for future monetary policy actions. It suggests a balanced approach, neither explicitly signaling an intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather to observe and react as necessary to achieve their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"Consumer price inflation, as measured by the 12-month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), was below 2 percent in July.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is below the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, and it could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support economic activity and help drive inflation towards the target level."
1,"These included a decline in the cost of business capital, a recent rise in orders and backlogs of nondefense capital goods, persisting gains in productivity that undoubtedly pointed to growing profit opportunities, progress in strengthening business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes various positive economic indicators, such as a decline in the cost of business capital, increased orders for nondefense capital goods, gains in productivity, stronger business balance sheets, and reduced capital overhangs. These observations suggest an improving economic environment, which could potentially support both the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general assessment of economic conditions that could be used to inform future policy decisions. The FOMC might view these conditions as supportive of their long-term goals without necessitating an immediate policy response, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
2,"Many noted that the slowdown could be a temporary aberration and that other labor market indicators--such as new claims for unemployment insurance, the rate of job openings, and readings on consumers' perceptions of the labor market--remained positive.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there is a slowdown, other labor market indicators remain positive, suggesting that the Committee sees both negative and positive signals in the economy. This balanced view does not clearly lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as they monitor various indicators."
0,The period of sub-par expansion was expected to foster an appreciable easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of reduced pressures on resources and a moderation in core price inflation due to a period of slower economic expansion. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth, aligning with a dovish outlook."
2,"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases,","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation (as measured by the 12-month change in PCE prices) will decrease in the coming months due to base effects and smaller expected monthly price increases. This suggests that inflationary pressures are anticipated to ease, which could reduce the need for tightening monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
1,They also noted that even with this additional firming the risks were still weighted mainly in the direction of rising inflationary pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that despite the additional tightening (firming) of monetary policy, there is still a predominant risk of increasing inflationary pressures. This suggests that the FOMC may continue or intensify its tightening measures to counteract inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes combating inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
1,"Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates strong employment growth and a low unemployment rate, which could signal a robust economy potentially leading to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
0,"In light of asset market developments over the intermeeting period, which in large part appeared to reflect heightened expectations among investors that the Federal Reserve would undertake additional purchases of longer-term securities, the November forecast was conditioned on lower long-term interest rates, higher stock prices, and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar than was the staff's previous forecast.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that investors expect the Federal Reserve to engage in additional purchases of longer-term securities, which is typically a form of quantitative easing. However, the context suggests that these expectations have already led to lower long-term interest rates, higher stock prices, and a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, which are conditions that can stimulate economic activity. If the Fed's forecast is conditioned on not wanting these conditions to go too far, it may imply a concern about potential overheating or inflationary pressures, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to counteract these effects. Thus, the stance appears to be more on the side of preventing excessive easing, which is considered hawkish."
2,"Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the current risks to the economic outlook as roughly balanced, which suggests that they do not currently see a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The phrase ""monitoring inflation developments closely"" implies vigilance over inflation trends, but it does not commit to any specific action, such as raising or lowering interest rates. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, consistent with a neutral stance."
2,Real outlays for office and computing equipment continued to grow rapidly as prices of personal computers and networking equipment remained on a steep downtrend.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is rapid growth in real outlays for office and computing equipment, with prices for certain types of equipment falling. This observation does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides information on a specific sector of the economy. The mention of falling prices could suggest a lack of inflationary pressure in that sector, but without additional context on the overall inflation rate or employment situation, it does not clearly signal a need to adjust monetary policy in a hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its meeting in July reaffirmed the ranges it had established in January for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail of monetary policy implementation. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of policy but rather a continuation of previously set targets. The statement is focused on maintaining the established policy path, which is consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It does not explicitly suggest any changes to the stance of monetary policy, hence it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"Members cited greater, albeit still occasional, indications of heightened worker demands in labor negotiations that likely were encouraged in part by ample job opportunities.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are signs of increased worker demands in labor negotiations, which may be driven by the abundance of job opportunities. This suggests that the labor market is tight, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
1,"M2 growth dropped in the second quarter and remained modest in July, consistent with moderating growth of nominal income and rising opportunity cost.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the growth of the money supply (M2) has slowed, which is in line with slower growth in nominal income and an increase in the opportunity cost of holding money. This observation is a statement of economic conditions rather than a clear indication of future policy moves. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of recent economic trends. The FOMC might use such information to inform their policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction of policy change."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at this meeting established ranges for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's decision to set target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3. This action in itself does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a tool for managing the money supply to support overall economic objectives. The ranges allow for flexibility in response to changing economic conditions, aiming to balance the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The establishment of growth ranges for monetary aggregates is a technical decision and does not inherently signal an intent to either increase or decrease the restrictiveness of monetary policy."
2,"While favorable financing would help to sustain the housing sector, members anticipated that any further impetus to growth from that sector was likely to be limited.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while favorable financing conditions could support the housing sector, the FOMC members do not expect significant additional growth from this sector. This suggests a balanced view without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a direct statement of policy intent."
1,"Looking to the future, however, the members generally agreed that the risks were in the direction of a heightening in inflation pressures despite their belief that growth in overall demand now seemed to have declined to a more sustainable pace and probably would continue to expand for a time at a rate below that of the economy's output potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about the potential for increased inflation pressures in the future, despite a slowdown in demand growth to a more sustainable pace. This concern for rising inflation suggests that the Committee might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding their target level. The mention of risks tilted towards higher inflation aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies readiness to act against inflation, potentially through raising interest rates or other contractionary measures."
2,"So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been an improvement in employment conditions, with faster payroll growth and a declining unemployment rate, yet acknowledges that unemployment is still higher than desired. This suggests a balanced view of the labor market, without a clear indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement recognizes progress towards the goal of maximum employment but also implies that there is still work to be done, which does not clearly signal an immediate need for a change in policy stance."
2,"Looking ahead, reports from retailer contacts were somewhat mixed; many anticipated relatively depressed holiday sales and where possible were making efforts to limit buildups of holiday merchandise, while other retailers were confident that sales would be reasonably well maintained, albeit generally somewhat below levels or growth rates experienced in previous holiday seasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes mixed expectations among retailers regarding future sales, with some anticipating lower sales and others expecting sales to be maintained, though at lower levels or growth rates than in previous years. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments, as it reflects uncertainty and varied outlooks rather than a definitive economic trend that would necessitate either tightening or easing of policy. It is a neutral observation of market conditions without a direct implication for immediate monetary policy action."
0,"Housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year, but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a mixed economic situation where there is an improvement in housing demand and consumer spending, which could be seen as positive indicators for the economy, but it also notes that capital spending is weak due to business uncertainty and pessimism. This suggests that there are both positive and negative economic factors at play, which does not clearly indicate a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might consider these mixed signals as part of their balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Several participants noted ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector, including those associated with increased trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and the effects of wet weather and severe flooding.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes current economic conditions affecting the agricultural sector, specifically mentioning challenges such as trade uncertainty, weak export demand, and weather-related issues. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on certain economic factors that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action towards changing the monetary policy but rather acknowledges external economic challenges."
2,"Future policy adjustments would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a data-dependent approach, suggesting that future policy adjustments will be based on new economic information as it becomes available. This stance does not commit to either tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes a balanced and responsive approach to changing economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to adjusting policy as needed to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without indicating a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
0,"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation has been low recently and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which suggests there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth, aligning with a dovish approach."
2,"Labor markets appeared to be stabilizing as private nonfarm payrolls grew in September for the first time since January, and employment losses in July and August turned out to be smaller than data initially had indicated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of labor market conditions, noting an improvement with the growth of private nonfarm payrolls and a revision of past employment losses. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an update on employment trends. This information could be used to inform future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment but does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"In conjunction with the FOMC meeting in April, all meeting participants (Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents) provided annual projections for economic growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for the period 2008 through 2010.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural aspect of the FOMC's operations, specifically the provision of economic projections by meeting participants. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Committee's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making based on economic indicators, which is consistent with their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence does not provide information on the direction of policy adjustments or the Committee's response to economic conditions, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"The staff viewed the uncertainty around its December projections for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections, stating that it is similar to the historical average. This does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance towards either tightening or easing, but rather reflects an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty. It suggests a balanced view without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
1,Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""Nonfarm payroll employment rose substantially further in October"" suggests a strong labor market, which could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially increase inflation. This could imply a need for the Federal Reserve to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"On the other hand, if recent productivity gains were to be sustained, as some business contacts indicated they would be, potential output currently could be higher than standard measures suggested, and the high level of the unemployment rate could be a more accurate indication of slack in resource utilization than usual measures of the output gap.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if the recent productivity gains continue, the potential output of the economy could be higher than what standard measures indicate. This suggests that the current high unemployment rate might reflect a greater degree of slack in the economy than traditional output gap measures would suggest. In the context of monetary policy, acknowledging higher potential output without corresponding inflationary pressures could mean that there is less urgency to ease monetary policy. Instead, it could be an argument for maintaining or even tightening policy to prevent the economy from overheating, especially if the unemployment rate starts to fall as the economy adjusts to the higher potential output. This stance is more aligned with a hawkish view, where the focus is on preventing inflation and overheating rather than stimulating the economy."
1,"In their discussion of developments in asset markets, the participants' comments focused on two related issues: the low level of long-term interest rates and the continued run-up in home prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' discussion on asset market developments, specifically mentioning low long-term interest rates and rising home prices. It does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects observations of current market conditions, which could be used to inform future policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards raising or lowering interest rates or otherwise adjusting monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,"and that given the downside risks to economic growth, an early exit could unnecessarily damp the ongoing economic recovery.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a concern that tightening monetary policy too soon could harm the economic recovery, indicating a preference for maintaining a more accommodative stance to support growth. This implies a leaning towards easing rather than tightening, in line with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,They also agreed that the war and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members recognize additional inflationary pressures arising from the war and related events, which suggests a concern for rising inflation. This concern typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to control inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The mention of these pressures implies that the FOMC might consider actions to prevent inflation from rising further, which could include increasing interest rates or other measures to tighten monetary policy."
0,"Nonetheless, the potential for significant further weakening in housing activity and home prices represented a downside risk to the economic outlook.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about a potential decline in housing activity and home prices, which could negatively impact the economic outlook. This suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to counteract such a downside risk, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
1,"With underlying inflation expected to be relatively low, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC plans to remove policy accommodation, which typically means raising interest rates or reducing asset purchases, but at a pace that is ""likely to be measured."" This suggests a gradual tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The reference to ""underlying inflation expected to be relatively low"" implies that the FOMC is confident in proceeding with tightening without the immediate pressure of high inflation, aiming to preemptively manage inflation risks while pursuing its long-term target of 2%."
0,"Moreover, most members saw substantial downside risks to the economic outlook and judged that a rate reduction at this meeting would provide valuable additional insurance against an unexpectedly severe weakening in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members perceive significant risks to the economic outlook and believe that lowering interest rates would serve as a precaution against potential economic downturns. This suggests a stance towards easing monetary policy to support economic activity, which aligns with a dovish approach. The mention of ""a rate reduction"" specifically points to an action that would make monetary conditions more accommodative, aiming to stimulate the economy in the face of perceived risks, which is consistent with a dovish policy stance."
2,"Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a state of uncertainty regarding inflation expectations. This suggests that the FOMC is acknowledging the unpredictable nature of inflation but does not commit to a specific policy action, thus maintaining a neutral stance. The sentence implies that the FOMC is monitoring the situation and could adjust its policy in response to new data, but it does not suggest an immediate move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy stance."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the paragraph below for inclusion in the press statement to be released shortly after the meeting: ""The Committee perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sees the risks to both growth and price stability as balanced for the upcoming quarters. This suggests that they do not currently see a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy more than what is already anticipated, as the risks to their dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices are viewed as roughly equal. This balanced view is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance, where the FOMC is neither particularly hawkish (looking to tighten policy) nor dovish (looking to ease policy)."
2,"Indeed, consumer expenditures appeared to have been expanding moderately over the previous few months, buoyed by increases in employment, personal income, and household wealth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where consumer expenditures are increasing at a moderate pace, supported by positive economic indicators such as employment, personal income, and household wealth. This suggests a balanced economic environment that does not explicitly call for immediate monetary policy adjustments. The statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects a steady state of economic conditions aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,They also agreed that the inflation situation seemed to have improved slightly and judged that it was no longer appropriate to indicate that a sustained moderation in inflation pressures had yet to be shown.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members recognize an improvement in the inflation situation and no longer find it necessary to wait for further evidence of sustained moderation in inflation pressures. This suggests that they may be less inclined to introduce further monetary easing measures and could be considering tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"The drop in the unemployment rate over the past year, while welcome and significant, could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions, in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a positive trend in the unemployment rate but also notes a potentially misleading factor due to the decline in labor force participation. This suggests a balanced view on the labor market conditions, without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an awareness of the complexities in interpreting labor market indicators, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
1,"The staff's near-term forecast for inflation was revised up a little, as recent data showed somewhat faster-than-anticipated increases that were judged to be only partly transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's forecast for inflation has been revised upward due to recent data showing faster-than-expected increases in prices, which suggests that the inflation is not entirely temporary. This could imply a need for a tightening of monetary policy to counteract the higher inflation and steer it back towards the FOMC's target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it aims to prevent the economy from overheating and keep inflation in check."
1,"In the context of this discussion, many participants commented that their view of potential output growth was somewhat more optimistic than that of the staff.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that many participants have a more optimistic view of potential output growth than the staff, which could suggest that the economy is capable of growing at a faster rate without leading to higher inflation. This optimism about economic growth could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall goals rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it signal a clear direction for future policy moves. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth reflects a balanced approach to their dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Several participants observed that the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas had stayed near 2 percent recently, underscoring the view that the recent low readings on inflation will prove transitory.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC participants believe the low inflation readings are temporary, as indicated by the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation staying near the 2 percent target. This implies that the Committee may not see a need for an accommodative policy response to low inflation figures, as they expect inflation to return to target on its own. This stance leans toward maintaining or potentially tightening monetary policy to prevent future inflation from overshooting the target, reflecting a hawkish view."
1,"Nonetheless, the reported rise in employment of temporary workers in recent months could presage a broader increase in job growth and thus was a welcome development.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a positive outlook on employment trends, suggesting that the increase in temporary workers might lead to broader job growth. This observation is a factual statement about labor market conditions rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather acknowledges a potentially positive development in the labor market, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
2,"While participants generally felt that the pace of underlying productivity growth remained robust, careful attention would need to be paid to developments regarding unit labor costs and profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring economic indicators such as unit labor costs and profit margins, which could influence the FOMC's assessment of inflationary pressures and productivity growth. However, it does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather a vigilant approach to future economic developments. This stance is consistent with a balanced and data-dependent perspective, which is neither overtly hawkish nor dovish."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants anticipate further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, which is a tool for tightening monetary policy. The expectation of rate increases is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it aims to manage inflation and prevent the economy from overheating while maintaining strong labor market conditions. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,The latter could well be augmented by sharply rising medical costs and by attempts to protect the purchasing power of wages from the erosion caused by the rise in energy prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about inflationary pressures arising from sharply rising medical costs and efforts to shield wages from the impact of increasing energy prices. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent these factors from pushing inflation above their target level, in line with their commitment to stable prices. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"In the residential real estate sector, home sales and construction had increased from very low levels, and house prices appeared to be stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations in the residential real estate sector, noting improvements in home sales and construction, as well as stabilization in house prices. This information is indicative of a sector-specific development and does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects a neutral stance as it simply reports on economic conditions without implying a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Moreover, not all measures of core inflation had accelerated","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Moreover, not all measures of core inflation had accelerated"" suggests that while some measures of core inflation may have increased, others have not, indicating a mixed or uncertain inflationary environment. This statement does not clearly signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it reflects a balanced view on inflation. It implies that the FOMC might be waiting for more definitive data on inflation trends before deciding on a monetary policy action, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation target over the long term."
2,The staff's forecast for inflation was basically unchanged from the projection prepared for the previous FOMC meeting.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the staff's inflation forecast has not changed since the previous FOMC meeting, suggesting that there has been no significant change in the economic outlook that would warrant a shift in monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any imminent action to tighten or ease monetary policy, thus reflecting a balanced or status quo perspective."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about core inflation being ""uncomfortably high"" and emphasize the need for ""further moderation."" This concern about high inflation suggests that the FOMC may be inclined to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down towards their target, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce inflationary pressures."
0,"Members agreed that the Federal Reserve was committed to using its full range of tools to support the U. S. economy in this challenging time, thereby promoting its maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to use all available monetary policy tools to support the economy, which suggests a readiness to ease policy if necessary to promote employment and price stability. This stance is typically associated with a dovish approach, where the focus is on stimulating the economy rather than on preventing inflation."
2,"In light of these uncertainties as well as continued evidence of muted inflation pressures, participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants see no urgent need to adjust the federal funds rate due to ""muted inflation pressures"" and ""uncertainties."" The use of the word ""patient"" suggests that they are in no rush to tighten monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors maintaining or reducing interest rates to support economic growth and employment, especially when inflation is not a pressing concern."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on maintaining an accommodative policy stance to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish approach. It emphasizes the importance of keeping monetary policy easy, particularly when the federal funds rate is close to its effective lower bound, to support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a preference for easing rather than tightening monetary policy to maintain economic momentum and credibility in the new policy framework."
2,Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations had been little changed in recent months"" indicates that there has been stability in the public's expectations for inflation over the longer term, without signaling a clear need for the Federal Reserve to either tighten or ease monetary policy. This suggests that inflation expectations are aligned with the Federal Reserve's target, and there is no immediate pressure to adjust policy in response to changing expectations. Therefore, the stance is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing), but rather neutral, reflecting a steady state of expectations."
1,"There were more reports that rising wages and benefits and increasing costs of nonlabor inputs could no longer be fully offset by improvements in productivity, and more business firms appeared to be attempting or considering increases in their selling prices to maintain or improve their profit margins.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising wages and input costs that are outpacing productivity gains, leading to attempts by businesses to raise selling prices to maintain or improve profit margins. This scenario suggests upward pressure on inflation, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
2,"In discussing the effect of labor market conditions on inflation, a number of participants expressed skepticism about recent studies suggesting that long-term unemployment provides less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment does.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants are skeptical about the idea that long-term unemployment exerts less downward pressure on wage and price inflation than short-term unemployment. This skepticism could imply that they believe all unemployment, whether short-term or long-term, has a similar effect on suppressing inflation. If they believe that the labor market conditions are tighter than what recent studies suggest (due to the impact of long-term unemployment being underestimated), this could lead to concerns about potential inflationary pressures. As a result, the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,"While these developments were positive, participants noted several factors that likely would continue to restrain the expansion in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite positive developments, there are factors expected to limit economic growth. This suggests a cautious or accommodative stance, as the FOMC may be more likely to ease monetary policy to support the expansion in economic activity, aligning with their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,Participants anticipated that inflation would continue to gradually rise as resource utilization tightened further and as wage pressures became more apparent,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants expect inflation to increase as resources become more utilized and wage pressures grow. This expectation of rising inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is considering a reduction in the nominal federal funds rate to counteract an increase in the real federal funds rate due to a recent decline in inflation. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy because the real interest rate (adjusted for inflation) has effectively risen, which could slow down economic activity. By reducing the nominal rate, the FOMC aims to keep the real rate from increasing further, which is a hawkish move to prevent the economy from cooling too much and to maintain its mandate of stable prices."
1,The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in the second quarter.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports a fact about the trade deficit without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC would respond by tightening or easing monetary policy, as the trade deficit can be influenced by many factors outside the scope of monetary policy. The statement does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a deviation from the 2% inflation target that would necessitate a policy adjustment."
0,"remained below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has remained below the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective, which suggests that there is less immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. The reference to lower energy and non-energy import prices as contributing factors implies that inflation is not a current concern, and therefore, there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support employment and economic growth without the risk of triggering undesirable levels of inflation."
2,such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy's sustainable potential.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there are ongoing uncertainties regarding labor market dynamics and the sustainable potential growth of the economy. This reflects a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC is acknowledging the complexities and unknowns in the economic environment, which suggests a cautious approach to policy-making but does not commit to a specific direction of policy adjustment."
2,Several members noted the benefits of accumulating further information that could help clarify the contours of the outlook for economic activity and inflation as well as the need for further policy action.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are in a wait-and-see mode, looking for more information before deciding on any policy action. This suggests a balanced approach, neither signaling an immediate intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather to observe economic indicators more closely before making a decision. It reflects a stance of careful monitoring and readiness to adjust policy as needed to achieve their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without committing to a specific direction at this time."
1,Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the April–May FOMC meeting was revised up on net.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic projection for U.S. economic activity has been revised upward, suggesting an improvement in economic conditions. This could imply that the economy is performing better than previously expected, which may lead to increased inflationary pressures. In response to stronger economic activity and potential inflation concerns, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"The Committee also noted in March that although output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had lagged, and increases in core consumer prices were muted and expected to remain low.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite solid economic expansion, there is a lag in new hiring, and core consumer price increases are muted with expectations to remain low. This suggests that there is less concern about inflationary pressures and more concern about achieving maximum employment, which could imply a leaning towards an easing of monetary policy to support job growth and prevent deflationary risks."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
2,"Committee Policy Action In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members agreed that the stance of monetary policy should not be changed at this meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members have reached a consensus to maintain the current stance of monetary policy without any changes. This suggests a balanced approach, neither tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy at the current meeting, which aligns with a neutral stance. They are neither indicating a move towards stimulating the economy nor restraining it, but rather maintaining their current position as they continue to monitor economic indicators and assess risks."
0,"In contrast, the dollar appreciated against the AFE currencies, reflecting continued divergence in monetary policy expectations for the United States and AFEs as well as political uncertainty in Europe.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the currency market, noting the appreciation of the dollar against AFE (Advanced Foreign Economies) currencies due to differing monetary policy expectations and political uncertainty in Europe. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. It reflects the external economic conditions that may influence the FOMC's policy decisions but does not commit to a specific monetary policy stance."
2,Recent data on consumer prices and unit labor costs led the staff to revise down slightly its projection for core PCE price inflation for 2010 and 2011,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff has revised down its projection for core PCE price inflation, which suggests that inflation pressures are lower than previously expected. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation to stimulate the economy or employment."
0,"On balance, core consumer price inflation was projected to remain subdued and quite possibly edge lower.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that core consumer price inflation will remain low or even decrease, which suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This dovish stance implies a potential for maintaining or easing the current monetary policy to support economic activity, as low inflation is typically not a trigger for monetary tightening."
2,Participants observed that both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remained near 2 percent on a 12-month basis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation is close to the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively achieving one of its key goals—stable prices. Since the statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease the monetary policy to correct for inflation deviations, it reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's objectives."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there may be a need for more tightening overall, an immediate acceleration of tightening is not deemed necessary. This indicates a balance between the need to manage inflation and the recognition of existing economic slack and contained inflation pressures. The mention of productivity growth helping to keep unit labor costs and prices in check further supports a stance that is neither urgently hawkish nor explicitly dovish, but rather one that maintains the current policy approach while being ready to adjust as necessary."
1,"The prospect of additional fiscal stimulus likely contributed to a steeper U. S. Treasury yield curve, increased inflation compensation, and broad dollar depreciation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that fiscal stimulus is expected to lead to a steeper U.S. Treasury yield curve, higher inflation expectations (inflation compensation), and a weaker dollar. These outcomes suggest that the economy might be heating up, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In response to such pressures, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, hence the classification as HAWKISH."
0,"Moreover, the staff still judged that the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were tilted to the downside, with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff of the FOMC perceives a higher likelihood of weaker-than-expected economic growth (real GDP growth risks tilted to the downside) and a potential increase in the unemployment rate (risks skewed to the upside for the unemployment rate). This suggests that the FOMC might be more inclined to ease monetary policy to support economic growth and prevent a rise in unemployment, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes stimulating the economy over containing inflation."
2,Risk sentiment abroad fluctuated over the intermeeting period as market participants weighed increasing coronavirus cases in a number of countries against improving economic data releases and ongoing fiscal and monetary policy support.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the balance of various factors that influence market sentiment, including both negative (increasing coronavirus cases) and positive (improving economic data and policy support) elements. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of the current economic environment. The FOMC is likely to consider these factors in its policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not suggest a clear direction for policy change."
0,"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that productivity increases and moderate wage gains are expected to keep unit labor costs low, which in turn indicates a favorable outlook for maintaining low inflation. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
2,"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of current spending on equipment and software, attributing it mainly to replacement demand rather than investment that would increase the capital stock (capital deepening). This observation does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral statement that reflects the FOMC's analysis of investment trends without suggesting a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
0,"Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes concerns about the long-term economic effects of the pandemic, such as potential sectoral restructuring and technological disruption, which could impact employment growth and firms' pricing power. It does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges uncertainties and potential structural changes in the economy. The focus is on the potential challenges to achieving maximum employment and stable prices, without suggesting immediate policy action."
2,"However, economic activity continued to be depressed in areas affected by the downturn in the energy sector and falling agricultural commodity prices, al­though several participants noted that the recent firming in crude oil prices had led to a modest increase in drilling activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific economic condition related to the energy sector and agricultural commodity prices, noting both negative and slightly positive developments. It does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of certain economic factors. The mention of a ""modest increase in drilling activity"" due to firmer crude oil prices suggests some improvement, but this is balanced by the acknowledgment of continued depressed economic activity in certain areas. This balanced view does not clearly advocate for a change in monetary policy stance, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Inflation compensation for 2007 declined modestly, perhaps reflecting the further drop in spot energy prices, but was largely unchanged at longer maturities.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about inflation compensation without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It notes a modest decline in inflation compensation, possibly due to lower energy prices, but also mentions stability at longer maturities. This suggests a balanced view of inflation expectations, without signaling an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
0,"Housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a weakening in the housing market, with declining housing starts, falling house prices, and high inventories of unsold homes. This suggests that the economy might be facing downward pressures, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and support the housing sector. The description does not indicate inflationary concerns or an overheating economy that would warrant a tightening of monetary policy. Instead, it points to potential risks to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, which could be addressed through more accommodative measures."
1,"Weekly data for March, however, indicated that gasoline prices rose sharply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a sharp increase in gasoline prices, which could contribute to higher inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, rising inflation may prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity is still robust.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC views the expansion in economic activity as ""still robust,"" which suggests that the economy is growing strongly. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a robust expansion could lead to concerns about overheating, which might increase inflationary pressures. To maintain stable prices and achieve its 2% inflation target, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly. The authorization to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions could imply adjustments to the federal funds rate or other measures to moderate the pace of economic expansion, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the comprehensive approach the FOMC takes in assessing economic conditions to inform its monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the use of a broad set of data to guide decisions. This approach is consistent with a balanced and data-driven stance that could lead to either tightening or easing, depending on the interpretation of the indicators."
2,"As long as the Federal Reserve is required to set and report ranges for money and debt growth, it should update them as appropriate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a procedural approach to updating ranges for money and debt growth as necessary, which is a part of the Federal Reserve's normal operations. This reflects a commitment to adaptability and transparency in response to changing economic conditions, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish policy direction."
0,"The ongoing public health crisis will weigh heavily on economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, and poses considerable risks to the economic outlook over the medium term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees the public health crisis as a significant negative factor for economic activity, employment, and inflation, suggesting that the economy is facing headwinds that could lead to weaker than desired outcomes in these areas. This perspective is dovish because it implies that the FOMC may be inclined to implement or maintain an easing monetary policy stance to counteract the adverse effects of the crisis and support the economy, in line with its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of a slowdown in real GDP growth to a level that is roughly equal to the potential output growth in the near future. This indicates a forecast of economic conditions that neither suggests an overheating economy that would require a tightening of monetary policy (hawkish) nor an underperforming one that might need stimulus (dovish). It reflects a balanced view of the economy's performance relative to its potential, without a clear indication of a need to adjust monetary policy in either direction."
1,"However, it was noted that the Committee had in place tools that would enable it to remove policy accommodation quickly if necessary to avoid an undesirable increase in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is prepared to tighten monetary policy rapidly if there is a risk of inflation rising undesirably. This readiness to remove policy accommodation (i.e., to potentially raise interest rates or reduce asset purchases) to prevent high inflation aligns with a hawkish stance, which is generally concerned with controlling inflation even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is usually associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or curbing inflation."
0,"Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential feedback loop where declines in house prices could lead to reduced consumption, which in turn could negatively impact employment and income, leading to further decreased demand for housing. This statement is simply outlining a possible economic scenario without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the interconnectedness of various economic factors."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes. It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives, without indicating a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,Consumer price inflation was being held down by weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is being kept low due to reduced demand and lower oil prices, which suggests that there is less pressure on the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that there is room for a more accommodative stance to support demand without risking an overshoot of the FOMC's inflation target."
0,Both of these views would suggest a lower level of potential output and thus reduced scope for combating unemployment with additional monetary policy stimulus.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that there is limited room for using monetary policy to further combat unemployment without potentially causing other issues, such as inflation. This suggests a stance against further easing of monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish outlook."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where a surge in inventory investment contributed to an increase in output, but it also anticipates a moderation in inventory accumulation, which is expected to lead to reduced economic growth. This statement is primarily descriptive and does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions without a clear bias toward action to either raise or lower interest rates."
0,"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a focus on maintaining an accommodative policy stance to ensure that inflation averages 2 percent, which is consistent with a dovish approach. It suggests that the policymakers are concerned about keeping monetary policy easy enough to support the economy and prevent inflation from falling below the target, which would help in achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. The mention of the ""effective lower bound on the federal funds rate"" implies that there is limited room for further rate cuts, which is a concern typically associated with a dovish policy stance that aims to stimulate the economy rather than restrain it."
2,"as a result, headline PCE price inflation was expected to substantially exceed core PCE price inflation in 2008.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that headline PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) price inflation, which includes food and energy prices and is a broader measure of inflation, was expected to exceed core PCE price inflation, which excludes these volatile items. This suggests that overall inflation was anticipated to be higher than the inflation rate that excludes the more volatile components. Since the FOMC targets a 2% inflation rate over the long term, an expectation of substantially higher inflation would typically prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. Tightening monetary policy is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided to maintain the status quo regarding the tentative ranges for money growth set previously, due to uncertainty in projections. This suggests a balanced approach, neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy, but rather waiting for more information before making any changes."
2,"The members viewed the outlook for core price inflation as still quite benign, largely reflecting the ample availability of labor and other producer resources to accommodate rising economic activity and the favorable prospects for further robust growth in productivity.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the members of the FOMC see a low risk of inflation due to the ample availability of labor and other resources, as well as the expectation of strong productivity growth. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
1,"The nominal deficit on U. S. trade in goods and services widened substantially in July, reflecting both a decline in exports and a rise in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance but does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. A widening trade deficit due to a decline in exports and a rise in imports could have various implications for the economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest whether the FOMC would respond by tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply provides an economic observation without a clear directional cue on policy adjustments."
2,Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed on balance"" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices without suggesting immediate action to adjust the policy stance."
2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies an expectation of slow economic growth, which typically leads to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate demand. This dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's goals of supporting employment and economic activity when growth is anticipated to be below trend."
2,"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core consumer price indices have not risen significantly, suggesting that inflation pressures are not escalating. This could imply that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current monetary policy to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants' forecasts for economic growth are consistent with their previous projections, suggesting that there is no significant change in their outlook that would warrant a shift in monetary policy. The expectation that the recovery will strengthen over time does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy, but rather a steady, ongoing process consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals."
2,"Although participants had revised downward their projections for growth since their previous forecasts in June, they continued to anticipate that economic growth would pick up and the unemployment rate would decline gradually through 2014.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there has been a downward revision in growth projections, there is still an expectation of economic improvement and a gradual decrease in unemployment. This suggests a balanced view that does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The anticipation of growth and declining unemployment aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the statement does not explicitly suggest a change in policy stance."
2,The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to achieve price stability and support sustainable economic growth, which are key aspects of its dual mandate (the third aspect being moderate long-term interest rates). It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather states the overall goals of the Committee. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"While anecdotal reports suggested that softening was confined to only a few areas, the delayed effects of the drop in stock market prices and forecasts of slower employment and income growth suggested some moderation in housing activity at some point.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expectation of moderation in housing activity due to various factors, including a drop in stock market prices and slower employment and income growth. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation of economic conditions that could potentially influence future policy decisions. The FOMC might be weighing these developments against their objectives of maximum employment and stable prices, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy direction."
0,"Participants generally agreed that the drag on U. S. economic activity from the appreciation of the dollar since the summer of 2014 and the slowdown in foreign economic growth, particularly in emerging market economies, was likely to continue to depress U. S. net exports for some time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes external economic conditions affecting the U.S. economy, specifically the impact of a stronger dollar and slower foreign economic growth on U.S. net exports. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather assesses factors that the FOMC might consider in their policy decisions. The focus is on understanding the economic landscape rather than signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"In connection with the risks associated with an early start to policy normalization, many participants observed that a premature increase in rates might damp the apparent solid recovery in real activity and labor market conditions, undermining progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern that raising interest rates too soon could negatively impact the economic recovery and labor market conditions, which would be counterproductive to the FOMC's goals of achieving maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation rate. This suggests a preference for maintaining a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support continued economic growth and employment, rather than tightening policy, which would be consistent with a dovish outlook."
2,Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable"" suggests that there is no immediate concern for inflation rising above or falling below the target level. This indicates that the FOMC sees no need to adjust monetary policy aggressively in either direction to counteract inflation trends, reflecting a balanced view consistent with their long-term inflation goal. Stability in inflation expectations is generally a sign that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate for maintaining the FOMC's mandate of stable prices."
1,"While a preemptive tightening move might be warranted in the not-too-distant future to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy, these members believed that a symmetrical directive would best convey the message that no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are considering a future tightening of monetary policy to address inflationary pressures. Although they are not planning immediate action, the mention of a ""preemptive tightening move"" suggests a leaning towards a more aggressive stance to ensure inflation remains under control, aligning with the goal of stable prices. The use of ""symmetrical directive"" implies a desire to communicate a balanced approach in the short term, but the overall context leans towards a hawkish stance due to the anticipation of tightening to manage inflation."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members referred to the widespread statistical and anecdotal evidence that the surprising strength in economic activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members observed strong economic activity continuing from the previous year into the current one. This could suggest that the economy is performing well, potentially leading to higher inflation if it overheats. In such a scenario, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"The Committee also noted that output had continued to expand at a solid pace, new hiring had appeared to pick up, and although incoming data on inflation showed that it had moved somewhat higher, longer-term inflation expectations had remained well contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where economic growth is solid, employment is improving, and while inflation has increased, it is not leading to unanchored long-term expectations. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, with positive aspects (growth and employment) and a slight concern (inflation), but without a clear indication that the FOMC would either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The mention of ""well contained"" long-term inflation expectations indicates that the situation is not alarming enough to warrant a strong policy shift in either direction."
0,"Nevertheless, the staff continued to forecast that real GDP growth would pick up only gradually in 2012 and 2013, supported by accommodative monetary policy, easing credit conditions, and improvements in consumer and business sentiment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of gradual economic growth influenced by several factors, including accommodative monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent change in policy towards tightening or easing but rather indicates a continuation of the current policy stance to support growth. The mention of ""accommodative monetary policy"" implies that the current policy is aimed at supporting the economy, but without additional context suggesting a shift in policy, the stance remains neutral."
2,"Participants discussed the open market operations that the Federal Reserve had undertaken since September to implement monetary policy, as well as forthcoming operational measures.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a discussion about the operational aspects of implementing monetary policy through open market operations, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing policy. It reflects a procedural aspect of how the Federal Reserve conducts its policy rather than a stance on the policy itself."
2,"In any event, it was clear that forecasts in recent years typically had overstated the rise in inflation, and a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the extent to which productivity gains and other factors, some unspecified, might continue to hold down inflation in a period of robust economic growth and relatively tight labor markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite robust economic growth and tight labor markets, inflation has not risen as much as expected in recent years. It also acknowledges uncertainty about the impact of productivity gains and other factors on inflation. This suggests that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current policy to encourage employment and growth."
2,"Moreover, survey data on labor market attitudes of both consumers and businesses had not signaled a significant deterioration in employment prospects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is no significant change in employment prospects according to survey data, which suggests that the current state of the labor market is stable. This stability does not imply an immediate need for the FOMC to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as there is no indication of a shift towards either higher inflation or higher unemployment. The sentence reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's mandate of maximum employment and stable prices without suggesting a clear direction for policy adjustment."
0,"Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about potential negative impacts on the economy from the housing situation, suggesting that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to mitigate these risks. This dovish stance aligns with the goal of supporting employment and income, which are key aspects of the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment."
1,the recent increase in crude oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that there is an expectation of a temporary rise in inflation due to higher crude oil and gasoline prices. This could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract the inflationary pressure, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Members agreed to continue to monitor inflation developments closely"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, showing that the FOMC is attentive to inflation trends, which is consistent with their mandate for stable prices. The commitment to monitoring suggests that they are prepared to adjust policy as needed, but it does not reveal any immediate intention to either raise or lower interest rates."
1,Factors pointing to potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and relatively low grain supplies.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential inflationary pressures due to increased food prices and low grain supplies. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, in line with their goal of stable prices."
1,"Measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged up in early January, but remained lower than they had been in all but the last few weeks of 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where longer-term inflation expectations have slightly increased but are still not high compared to historical levels. This observation does not clearly indicate a need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that inflation expectations are somewhat contained, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The mention of inflation expectations being lower than historical levels except for a recent period implies that the situation is being monitored but does not in itself warrant a change in policy stance."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view rather than a clear indication of a policy shift towards tightening or easing. The mention of positive aspects like employment conditions and household net worth could be seen as supportive of economic growth, while the reference to limiting factors indicates caution and potential concerns that might counterbalance the positives. This balanced approach aligns with the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of indicators and adjusting policy as necessary to achieve its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,Sub-par expansion over the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core consumer price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC expects slower economic growth in the coming quarters, which they believe will lead to reduced pressure on resources (e.g., labor and capital) and a decrease in core consumer price inflation. This implies that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to counteract the expected slowdown and support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
1,"The recent depreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure on prices, would damp the deterioration in net U. S. exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a potential inflationary effect from a weaker dollar (upward pressure on prices) but also notes a countervailing positive impact on U.S. exports. This suggests a balance between concerns about inflation and trade balance, without a clear indication of a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a direct policy stance."
2,"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that inflation is expected to rise as the economy uses up excess capacity (resource slack diminishes) and inflation expectations stay stable. This implies that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too quickly, in line with its goal of maintaining stable prices. The anticipation of a gradual increase in inflation as the economy approaches full capacity could lead to an increase in interest rates to keep inflation near the target level."
2,survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable"" suggests that there is no significant change in the expectations of inflation in the long term, which implies that the current monetary policy stance may be appropriate. Stability in inflation expectations is generally a sign that the market believes the central bank is effectively managing inflation, aligning with its long-term target. This does not clearly indicate a need to either tighten or ease the monetary policy, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
0,"The median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Michigan survey edged down in October to a new historical low,","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the median expectation for inflation is declining, according to the Michigan survey, and has reached a new historical low. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not a current concern and may even be abating, which could imply that there is less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a lower expectation for inflation aligns with the target of stable prices and might reduce the urgency for hawkish measures."
0,"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members expect unemployment to stay high and inflation to remain below the Federal Reserve's long-term target for the next few years. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce policies that stimulate economic activity to reduce unemployment and move inflation closer to the target rate, which aligns with a dovish stance on monetary policy."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a readiness to adjust monetary policy in response to emerging risks but does not specify a direction of adjustment (tightening or easing). It reflects a balanced approach, maintaining flexibility to act in either direction to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement is consistent with a neutral policy stance, as it suggests the Committee is poised to respond to changes in economic conditions but does not commit to a specific policy path."
2,"Consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary, a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, produced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction; these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see recent lower inflation readings as possibly temporary and are looking at alternative measures of inflation, such as the trimmed mean measure of PCE price inflation, which has been stable around the target rate. This suggests a balanced view on inflation, neither clearly signaling an immediate need to tighten monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor indicating a need to ease it (which would be dovish). The reference to the trimmed mean measure implies careful monitoring of inflation trends without committing to a specific policy action."
1,"Rather, members agreed that inflation was likely to moderate in coming quarters,","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members expect inflation to decrease in the near future, which implies that there may be less need for aggressive tightening of monetary policy. This expectation of moderating inflation aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a potential easing of concerns about high inflation and, therefore, potentially less urgency to increase interest rates."
2,"Employment continued to expand unevenly,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Employment continued to expand unevenly"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the labor market without suggesting a particular policy response. The uneven expansion of employment could be interpreted in various ways, depending on other economic indicators and the broader context. Therefore, without additional information on whether this unevenness is seen as a problem that requires intervention or as a temporary fluctuation that does not warrant a change in policy, the stance remains neutral."
0,"with domestic spending strong, members were becoming more concerned that those developments might not exert enough restraint on aggregate demand to slow the expansion to a sustainable pace in line with the growth of the economy's potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about the strength of domestic spending potentially leading to an unsustainable pace of economic expansion. This suggests that they might consider tightening monetary policy to slow down aggregate demand and align the growth with the economy's potential, which is in line with a hawkish stance aiming to prevent overheating and control inflation."
2,"However, as had been the case for many years, the members remained concerned that forecasts of money growth were still subject to a wide range of error in terms of the anticipated relationships between money growth and aggregate economic performance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses concern about the uncertainty in forecasting the relationship between money growth and overall economic performance. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the challenges in predicting economic outcomes. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (suggesting tightening) nor dovish (suggesting easing), but rather acknowledges the complexities in making monetary policy decisions."
1,"With regard to the outlook for inflation, members gave considerable attention to the somewhat faster increases in broad price measures over the past year,","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about the pace of inflation increasing more quickly than in the past, which suggests they may consider tightening monetary policy to counteract rising inflation and steer it towards their target rate of 2%. This aligns with their goal of stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates."
2,"The behavior of the monetary aggregates will continue to be evaluated in the light of progress toward price level stability, movements in their velocities, and developments in the economy and financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will monitor monetary aggregates (such as money supply) alongside economic and financial developments to assess progress toward price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an ongoing evaluative approach. The focus on multiple indicators, including price level stability and velocity of money, reflects a balanced stance that is consistent with the FOMC's mandate to maintain stable prices. The sentence implies a data-driven and responsive approach to monetary policy rather than a commitment to a specific direction of policy change."
0,"Over the intermeeting period, yields on short- and intermediate-term nominal Treasury securities fell, while yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities of comparable maturity increased somewhat, pushing inflation compensation considerably lower at those horizons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observed movements in Treasury yields and inflation compensation but does not directly indicate a clear stance on the future direction of monetary policy. It simply reports on financial market conditions over a certain period. The decrease in nominal Treasury yields could suggest lower expectations for future interest rates or economic growth, while the increase in yields on inflation-indexed securities and lower inflation compensation might reflect changing market expectations about inflation. However, without additional context on the FOMC's interpretation or policy response to these observations, the sentence itself remains neutral."
1,"Going forward, consumer outlays were expected to be supported by further advances in employment and income.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of continued economic growth through increases in employment and income, which should support consumer spending. It does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic conditions related to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards either tightening or easing of monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
0,"While recognizing the improvement in a number of indicators of economic activity and labor market conditions since the fall, many members indicated that further improvement in the outlook for the labor market would be required before it would be appropriate to slow the pace of asset purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members are looking for further improvement in the labor market before considering a reduction in the pace of asset purchases. Asset purchases are typically used to stimulate economic activity by injecting liquidity into the financial system, which can help to support employment. The fact that they are not ready to slow these purchases indicates a stance towards maintaining or increasing monetary stimulus, which is consistent with a dovish policy approach aimed at supporting maximum employment."
1,"Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors' improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that equity markets declined due to expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would implement a more restrictive (tighter) monetary policy than previously anticipated. A more restrictive policy typically involves increasing interest rates to control inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to tighten monetary conditions. This suggests that the FOMC is focused on curbing inflation, even at the potential cost of slower economic growth or lower equity prices, which is consistent with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
1,Participants generally expected that household demand would gradually strengthen over coming quarters in response to the rise in household wealth from the substantial increase in equity prices that had occurred over the intermeeting period as well as the support for income provided by fiscal policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of strengthening household demand due to increased equity prices and fiscal policy support, which does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a commitment to adjust monetary policy in response to those conditions. The focus on expected improvements in household demand suggests a positive outlook on economic growth, but without explicit reference to policy adjustments, the stance remains neutral."
0,"Inflation had been subdued of late,","DOVISH

The sentence ""Inflation had been subdued of late"" suggests that inflation rates have been low recently. This could imply that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures, which might reduce the urgency for tightening monetary policy. A dovish stance is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to stimulate economic activity when inflation is not perceived as a threat. In the context of the FOMC's goals, subdued inflation aligns with their target of 2% inflation over the long term, and if inflation is indeed subdued, there may be room for a more accommodative policy to support employment without risking the overshooting of their inflation target."
2,The staff viewed the extent of uncertainty around its June projections for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate as roughly in line with the average over the past 20 years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's view on the uncertainty around economic projections for GDP growth and unemployment, stating that it aligns with the historical average. This does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to historical uncertainty levels. It suggests a balanced perspective without signaling a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in either direction."
1,"It was noted, however, that increases in compensation that exceeded productivity gains might be absorbed to some extent by a narrowing of firms’ high profit margins.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a consideration of the relationship between compensation increases, productivity gains, and firms' profit margins. It suggests that if compensation increases outpace productivity, it might not necessarily lead to inflationary pressure if firms absorb the costs through reduced profit margins. This statement does not clearly signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a potential economic dynamic. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
2,Many participants noted that they expected household spending to be a primary contributor to economic growth going forward.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Many participants noted that they expected household spending to be a primary contributor to economic growth going forward"" does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a neutral observation about the expected drivers of economic growth, specifically the role of household spending. This statement reflects an assessment of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to adjust monetary policy in either direction. It acknowledges the importance of consumer spending as a component of economic health, which is relevant to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but does not suggest imminent policy changes."
2,"Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations remained stable,"" indicates that there has been no significant change in the expectations of inflation in the long term. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively anchoring inflation expectations, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as stable expectations are consistent with the FOMC's target. Therefore, the stance is neither hawkish (implying a need to tighten policy due to rising inflation expectations) nor dovish (implying a need to ease policy due to falling inflation expectations), but rather neutral, indicating a balanced approach to monetary policy."
2,"In contrast, M3 growth slowed considerably in April after a robust March advance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In contrast, M3 growth slowed considerably in April after a robust March advance"" is a statement of fact regarding the change in the pace of money supply growth (M3) and does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply reports a change in economic conditions, which the FOMC might consider among other factors when deciding on monetary policy. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in response to this change in M3 growth."
2,"and special factors, including liquidity risk premiums, that might be influencing the pricing of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and inflation derivatives.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the consideration of special factors, such as liquidity risk premiums, that could affect the pricing of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and inflation derivatives. This statement is analytical and does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's effort to understand the nuances of financial markets and how they might relate to inflation expectations, which is part of their balanced approach to achieving their goals."
0,"Staff Economic Outlook In the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the March FOMC meeting, real GDP growth was revised down somewhat in the near term, largely reflecting the federal spending sequestration that went into effect on March 1 and the resulting drag from reduced government purchases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff's economic forecast has been revised down due to the impact of federal spending cuts, which suggests an expectation of slower economic growth. This slower growth could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support the economy, hence the dovish classification. The implication is that there may be less pressure to tighten monetary policy since the reduced government spending is likely to dampen economic activity, which is in line with a dovish approach to stimulate the economy and counteract the negative effects of the sequestration."
0,But equity prices were only holding their own after a substantial decline earlier and the dollar had appreciated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of equity prices and the value of the dollar without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. It simply states that equity prices are stable after a decline and that the dollar had appreciated, which does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider these factors when making decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy stance."
0,Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Although the unemployment rate edged up to 5."" does not provide a complete context or direction for monetary policy. An increase in the unemployment rate could be interpreted as a sign of a weakening economy, which might suggest a dovish stance if the FOMC were to consider easing policy to stimulate employment. However, without additional context on the reasons for the increase or its implications for inflation and long-term interest rates, it is not possible to determine a clear policy direction. Therefore, the sentence is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Although productivity growth had slowed from the extraordinarily rapid pace that prevailed earlier in the expansion, data for the fourth quarter of 2004, as well as preliminary indications for the first quarter of this year, suggested that gains from efficiency remained substantial.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where productivity growth has slowed but still indicates efficiency gains. This observation does not directly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. It provides an assessment of economic conditions without a clear indication of how the FOMC might adjust its policy stance in response. The sentence reflects an understanding of economic trends relevant to the FOMC's goals but does not signal a clear move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy."
2,"Al­though core inflation and the 12-month trimmed mean PCE inflation rate calculated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas remained a little below 2 percent, many participants anticipated that high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations would keep overall inflation near 2 percent over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while core inflation rates are currently below the FOMC's 2% target, there is an expectation that inflation will stabilize around the target level due to high levels of resource utilization and stable inflation expectations. This suggests a balance between concerns about current inflation levels and confidence in future inflation dynamics, without a clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy immediately. The Committee appears to be in a wait-and-see mode, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
0,Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that factors such as weaker demand and lower oil prices are contributing to lower consumer price inflation. This suggests that inflationary pressures are subdued, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could be seen as a reason to maintain or ease monetary policy to support economic activity, as inflation is not currently posing a threat to their target of 2% over the long term."
2,"In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is focused on the current inflation rate being below their 2 percent target. The use of ""carefully monitor"" suggests that they are prepared to take action to increase inflation towards the target, which typically involves easing monetary policy, such as lowering interest rates or other measures to stimulate economic activity. This stance is dovish as it implies a readiness to support the economy to boost inflation to the desired level."
2,"He thought future developments were equally likely to warrant an action in either direction, and he did not think the Committee should take a step that probably would cause expectations of further easing to become embedded in market interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about market expectations leaning too much towards further easing of monetary policy, which suggests a preference to avoid signaling a likelihood of future rate cuts. This stance implies a readiness to maintain or increase interest rates to prevent such expectations from becoming entrenched, aligning with a tightening of monetary policy to ensure price stability and manage inflation expectations."
2,"forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation, the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that while growth forecasts are moderate, there is still a perceived risk of rising inflation. This indicates a concern for inflationary pressures, which typically leads to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance. The FOMC would likely consider measures to ensure inflation remains close to their target, which could include raising interest rates or other contractionary actions."
0,"With the boost from these factors fading, real GDP growth was projected to step down noticeably in 2023 and to be roughly equal to potential output growth in 2023 and 2024.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of a natural moderation in economic growth to levels that are sustainable over the long term, aligning with the potential output. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy to either tighten or ease conditions, as it reflects a scenario where the economy is moving towards equilibrium without indicating significant inflationary or deflationary pressures."
1,"The possibility that longer-term inflation expectations may have edged down was roughly counterbalanced by the risks that somewhat firmer inflation this year could be more persistent than expected, particularly in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its long-run potential.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation could persist and become more entrenched, especially in an economy operating above its potential, which suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming more persistent. This stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and suggests that the Committee might lean towards measures that would prevent an overheating economy, such as raising interest rates."
1,"Indeed, in the interest of fostering a continuation of sustainable growth of the economy, it would be desirable to tighten before any sign of actual higher inflation were to become evident.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a proactive approach to tightening monetary policy in anticipation of potential inflation, even before it becomes evident. This indicates a stance towards preventing inflation from rising, aligning with the goal of stable prices, and suggests a willingness to potentially sacrifice some short-term economic growth for long-term stability. The preemptive nature of the tightening stance is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy, which prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating employment and growth."
2,"Despite further declines in vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, business spending on nonresidential construction also seemed to have been lackluster, with such activity not having changed much since last summer.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations of economic conditions, specifically in the real estate and business sectors, without directly suggesting an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It notes a decline in vacancy rates and rising real estate prices, which could be signs of economic strength, but also mentions that business spending on nonresidential construction has been lackluster, indicating some weakness or uncertainty in business investment. This mixed information does not clearly advocate for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus the stance is neutral."
1,"One participant, however, objected that purchases of MBS, when compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, would likely result in higher interest rates for many borrowers in other sectors.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) could lead to higher interest rates for borrowers in other sectors compared to purchases of longer-term Treasury securities. This concern reflects a stance that is cautious about expanding monetary policy too aggressively, as it might lead to tightening financial conditions for some borrowers, which is a characteristic of a hawkish policy stance. The focus on the potential for higher interest rates aligns with a tightening bias, as higher rates can be a tool to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"However, some participants noted that the recent rise in the prices of oil and other commodities, as well as increases in import prices stemming from the decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar, could boost inflation pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern among some FOMC participants that rising oil and commodity prices, along with higher import prices due to a weaker dollar, could lead to increased inflationary pressures. This concern suggests a potential need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"In general, financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that financial markets are in a state that could support stronger economic growth. This implies that the economy might be doing well enough to handle a tightening of monetary policy without stifling expansion, as the FOMC might increase interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,"The pace of real GDP growth was forecast to be faster over the second half of this year than in the first half, primarily reflecting a modest increase in the rate of growth of private domestic final purchases and a sizable turnaround in inventory investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation of increased economic growth, which is generally a positive outlook, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy. The forecast of faster GDP growth could be seen as a sign of economic health, which might suggest a future tightening if inflation were a concern, or it could simply be an observation of economic trends without an immediate policy implication. Since the sentence does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, it is best classified as neutral."
1,"The extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth, as implied by incoming information.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a wait-and-see approach, basing future policy decisions on incoming economic data related to inflation and economic growth. This suggests a balanced stance where the FOMC is neither committing to tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy without further evidence. The use of ""additional firming"" implies that there might be a bias towards tightening if conditions require, but the overall stance is conditional and data-dependent, which is a neutral position."
2,"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on monitoring inflation, which suggests that the FOMC is concerned about potential inflationary pressures. Being ""particularly vigilant"" implies that the Committee is ready to act, possibly by tightening monetary policy, to ensure inflation remains in check. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and suggests a stance that leans towards preventing higher inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
1,"In addition, increases in oil prices were expected to pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that rising oil prices are expected to lead to higher consumer energy prices, which could contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures and maintain price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is exhibiting strong demand and tightness, which often correlates with upward pressure on wages and potential inflationary concerns. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low,"DOVISH

The sentence ""Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low"" suggests that the expectations for future inflation are subdued, as reflected by financial market indicators. This could imply that there is less pressure on the FOMC to raise interest rates to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to support economic activity and employment."
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the external sector will have a minor restraining effect on economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of one of the many factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement is balanced and does not imply immediate action to either raise or lower interest rates, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"In the September Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), dealers indicated, on net, that they loosened credit terms applicable to several important classes of counterparties and types of collateral over the past three months amid increased demand for funding for most types of securities covered in the survey.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a survey result where dealers reported that they have loosened credit terms and experienced increased demand for funding, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It is more of an observation of market conditions rather than a statement of policy action. The loosening of credit terms could be a response to market dynamics rather than a result of FOMC policy changes. Therefore, without explicit context linking this to a policy decision, the stance remains neutral."
2,inflation was projected to pick up gradually in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will increase moderately due to a rebound in energy prices, but it does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for a change in monetary policy. It reflects an observation of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is simply forecasting a factor that could influence inflation, without indicating a policy response, thus it is considered neutral in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,"In contrast, economic activity declined in Japan during the third quarter after a surge in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic performance in Japan, noting a decline in economic activity during the third quarter following a period of growth in the first half of the year. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on U.S. monetary policy adjustments, such as changes to the federal funds rate, nor does it provide clear implications for the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates in the United States. It is merely a statement of fact about another country's economic performance without a direct policy implication."
1,"Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about a significant rise in the consumer price index, which is a measure of inflation. Although it notes that inflation expectations (as measured by the difference in yields between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities) have not changed much during the period, the fact that inflation measures are above pre-Hurricane Katrina levels suggests that inflationary pressures exist. This could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to address rising inflation, in line with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
0,"Mr. Kocherlakota dissented because, in his view, the new forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of the statement would weaken the credibility of the Committee's commitment to its inflation goal by failing to communicate purposeful steps to more rapidly increase inflation to the 2 percent target and by suggesting that the Committee views inflation persistently below 2 percent as an acceptable outcome.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that Mr. Kocherlakota believes the Committee's forward guidance is not sufficiently aggressive in pursuing measures to raise inflation to the 2 percent target. His dissent suggests that he advocates for a more accommodative policy stance to avoid the risk of inflation remaining below the desired level, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
0,"Consumer price inflation remained subdued in November, with both the overall index and the index excluding food and energy items rising at the same relatively low rates as in October.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation is subdued and has not increased, even when considering core inflation (which excludes volatile food and energy items). This suggests that inflationary pressures are not building in the economy, which could imply that there is less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat rising inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, subdued inflation aligns with the aim of stable prices and might allow for a more accommodative stance to support maximum employment without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,"In the course of the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members commented that there was no persuasive evidence in recent statistical measures that price inflation was currently picking up or that inflation expectations were rising, though the declines in both inflation and expectations experienced over the course of recent years no longer seemed to be occurring.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members do not see strong evidence of either increasing or decreasing inflation or inflation expectations, suggesting that they do not see an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy aggressively. The mention of inflation and expectations no longer declining suggests a stabilization, which aligns with a neutral stance where the FOMC is neither particularly hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (easing policy), but rather observing and ready to adjust as needed to maintain their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is merely an observation of economic activity, specifically in the housing finance sector, which could be influenced by a variety of factors, including previous monetary policy actions. This statement does not explicitly suggest an imminent change in policy to either become more restrictive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish). It is a neutral remark that could be part of a broader analysis of economic conditions."
2,"Some participants suggested that the persistently high level of unemployment reflected the impact of structural factors, including mismatches between the skills of the unemployed and the skills demanded in sectors in which jobs were currently available.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a viewpoint on the nature of unemployment, attributing it to structural factors such as skill mismatches, rather than to cyclical or short-term economic conditions. This analysis does not directly suggest an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy, as it points to issues that are not readily addressed by such measures. Instead, it implies a need for longer-term solutions, such as education and training programs, which are outside the direct purview of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is neutral with respect to immediate monetary policy actions."
1,"payroll employment posted solid gains, and, on balance, a range of labor market indicators suggested that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been solid growth in payroll employment and a general improvement in labor market conditions, suggesting a reduction in the underutilization of labor resources. This improvement aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment and could signal a potential for increased inflationary pressures as the labor market tightens. In response to such conditions, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of assessment and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that FOMC participants submitted their economic projections under their own judgments of appropriate monetary policy, without suggesting whether the policy should be tightened, eased, or remain the same."
0,"Increase the System Open Market Account holdings of Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace to sustain smooth functioning of markets for these securities, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) plans to continue purchasing Treasury securities, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) at least at the current pace. This action is aimed at ensuring the smooth functioning of the markets for these securities, which is essential for the effective transmission of monetary policy to the broader financial conditions. By maintaining or increasing the pace of asset purchases, the FOMC is providing additional monetary accommodation, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. This approach is often taken to stimulate the economy by keeping long-term interest rates low, supporting borrowing and spending, and thus helping to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"The U. S. international trade deficit narrowed in May, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the U.S. international trade deficit has decreased due to a rise in exports that surpasses the growth in imports. This information is primarily related to trade balance and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, as it does not explicitly relate to the central bank's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The improvement in trade balance could have various implications for the economy, but the sentence itself does not provide enough context to determine a shift towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
