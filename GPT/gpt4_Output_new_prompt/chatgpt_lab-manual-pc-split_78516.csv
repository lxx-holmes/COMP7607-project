1,"PCE core is at about 2, and I think we see that, you know, the temporary increase in headline inflation as being a function of oil prices probably, and we expect inflation to go back down to 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the current increase in headline inflation is viewed as temporary and primarily driven by oil prices, with expectations that inflation will return to the target level of 2 percent. This implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy aggressively if inflation is expected to self-correct without significant intervention."
1,"The problem with the current situation is that, that if you have a sustained period of supply shocks, those can actually start to undermine or to work—to work on de-anchoring inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that persistent supply shocks could lead to de-anchoring inflation expectations, which implies that inflation could become unmoored from the target level. This scenario would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising uncontrollably, thus aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity in the economy, with the goal of maintaining stable prices, which is one of the FOMC's primary objectives."
2,We continue to discuss whether or not the unemployment rate itself is an adequate measure of how much underutilization of labor resources there really is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an ongoing discussion about the adequacy of the unemployment rate as a measure of labor underutilization. This suggests that the FOMC is considering various indicators to assess the labor market, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving maximum employment, one of their key goals."
2,"And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the dynamic nature of the maximum level of employment in relation to price stability, acknowledging that it changes over time due to various factors, including those related to the pandemic. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather explains the considerations that affect the FOMC's assessment of the labor market within the context of its dual mandate. This reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"As a further step in enhancing the clarity of our communications, the Committee recently decided to begin publishing information about participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy—that is, the path of policy that each participant judges as most likely to foster mandate-consistent outcomes for employment and inflation if the economy evolves as expected.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a procedural change in how the FOMC communicates its policy assessments and does not directly indicate a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a commitment to transparency in the communication of individual participants' views on the appropriate path of monetary policy to achieve the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. This transparency is aimed at helping markets understand the range of views within the Committee and does not inherently suggest a change in the stance of monetary policy."
2,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply observes the potential impact of rising asset prices on the economy, which could be a positive contribution, but does not suggest an immediate action in terms of tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more descriptive of economic conditions rather than prescriptive of policy actions."
0,"However, at 7.7 percent, the unemployment rate remains elevated.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the unemployment rate is higher than desired, which suggests that the economy might not be at full employment—one of the FOMC's key goals. A dovish stance would be more likely in this context as the FOMC may consider easing monetary policy to stimulate job growth and reduce unemployment."
0,"Again, that’s not a forecast, I’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence implies a concern for slower improvement in unemployment, which suggests that the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to support job growth and move closer to its maximum employment goal. This dovish stance would be in line with efforts to stimulate the economy and reduce unemployment."
0,"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that falling oil prices are contributing to lower inflation. This suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment, as lower inflation might give the FOMC room to maintain or reduce interest rates."
2,These base effects will contribute about 1 percentage point to headline inflation and about 0.7 percentage point to core inflation in April and May.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a technical factor (base effects) that will temporarily influence inflation measurements. It does not directly indicate a policy action or a change in stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is simply providing an analysis of expected statistical changes in inflation data, which is a neutral description of how certain measurements will affect upcoming inflation reports."
2,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC takes into account risks to the financial system that could impede the achievement of its goals, which include maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes a consideration of financial stability in the broader context of policy-making. It reflects a balanced approach to monitoring economic indicators and risks, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
2,We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an ongoing assessment of the labor market without a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's effort to understand the labor market dynamics to determine what constitutes maximum employment, which is one of their goals. However, the sentence does not directly suggest any imminent policy action to either increase or decrease the interest rates or adjust monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook.,"HAWKISH

The sentence ""it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook"" suggests that there is a factor at play that could potentially influence the rate of inflation. Given the FOMC's mandate to maintain stable prices and its target of a 2% inflation rate over the long term, any indication that inflation could be affected implies that the Committee might consider adjusting monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures. This could mean tightening monetary policy, which is associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a view that the decline in the unemployment rate may not fully reflect a tightening labor market, suggesting that the situation is complex and does not warrant a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach, acknowledging the nuances in interpreting labor market indicators without committing to a specific policy direction."
0,"And inflation is moving—moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is trending upwards towards the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from overshooting the target, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation"" seems to emphasize the FOMC's focus on controlling price inflation. This suggests a commitment to tightening monetary policy if necessary to keep inflation in check, which aligns with a hawkish stance. The hawkish tone implies that the FOMC prioritizes its goal of stable prices and is prepared to adjust policy to address inflationary pressures, consistent with its target of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
0,"By the way, we’re also not at maximum employment, as I mentioned.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the economy has not achieved one of the FOMC's key goals, which is maximum employment. This suggests that there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support job growth, rather than tightening policy, which would be more aligned with a hawkish stance. The implication is that the FOMC may lean towards easing or maintaining current policy measures to help achieve maximum employment, consistent with a dovish outlook."
1,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if there is an unexpected sharp increase in wages or inflation, it could be a sign that the economy is reaching a point where it might overheat, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation and maintain stability. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors measures to control inflation, even at the risk of slowing down economic growth."
2,"So and, and, you know, the shorter-term ones do tend to move around based on, for example, gasoline prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a descriptive observation about the volatility of short-term inflation indicators, such as gasoline prices, rather than a statement indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the variability in certain economic indicators that the FOMC monitors."
0,"So those who can get credit, together with the low prices of houses, are at—able to buy much more house than they could have a few years ago.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that credit availability, combined with low housing prices, is enabling people to purchase more house than they could in the past. This suggests an easing condition in the housing market, which could be a result of accommodative monetary policy aimed at stimulating economic activity. The statement does not indicate a need to tighten monetary policy, as it reflects a scenario where the FOMC's actions may be supporting increased affordability in the housing market, which aligns with the goal of fostering maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"So in—in—in U-6, the U-6 level of unemployment has tripled from 7 percent to 21 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a significant increase in the U-6 level of unemployment, which is a broader measure of labor underutilization that includes those who are underemployed and marginally attached to the labor force, in addition to the unemployed. A tripling of the U-6 rate suggests a severe deterioration in employment conditions. While this might initially seem to call for a dovish response to stimulate the economy, the context of the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment implies that such a sharp increase in unemployment is far above their target level. This could lead the FOMC to adopt a hawkish stance in the medium to long term to prevent potential inflationary pressures that might arise when the economy starts to recover and to ensure that the economy does not overheat. The hawkish stance would be in anticipation of needing to tighten policy to stabilize prices once employment begins to improve."
0,"We’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Reserve's commitment to one of its key mandates, which is to pursue maximum employment. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reaffirms the FOMC's dedication to its congressionally assigned goals without providing specific information on policy direction."
0,"I expect that to continue, and I would expect also to see some improvement in the degree of part-time employment that’s for economic reasons.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation for continued improvement in employment conditions, specifically regarding part-time employment for economic reasons. This statement does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the employment situation. It reflects the FOMC's goal of maximum employment but does not suggest immediate policy action, thus it is considered neutral."
2,Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Our current framework for implementing monetary policy is working very well"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests satisfaction with the current policy framework's performance, which implies a balanced approach without signaling imminent changes to the policy stance. It reflects a view that the existing measures are effectively supporting the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Returning to monetary policy, we recognize that there has been a great deal of focus on today’s policy decision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes, such as tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the attention given to the policy decision, without indicating a stance on the adjustment of the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,The outbreak has also disrupted economic activity in many countries and has prompted significant movements in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of an outbreak on economic activity and financial markets, but it does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. It simply states the conditions that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions."
2,"But again, our basic forecast is one which is basically, as was pointed out earlier by Mr. Hilsenrath, a moderately optimistic forecast, where growth picks up as we pass through this period of fiscal restraint","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a moderately optimistic economic forecast, suggesting that growth is expected to increase after a period of fiscal restraint. This statement does not explicitly signal an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys an expectation of economic improvement. It reflects a balanced view that is neither particularly hawkish (suggesting tightening) nor dovish (suggesting easing)."
2,"And in so far as that will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will consider a wide range of factors, including policies, the global environment, and oil prices, when determining monetary policy. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, without a clear indication of a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC is expressing a readiness to adjust policy as needed based on a comprehensive assessment of various influences on the economy, which aligns with a neutral stance."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" is a statement of economic condition rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Low productivity could have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral."
2,"You know, we’re, we’re—inflation measures are always going to be a bit volatile.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the inherent volatility in inflation measures without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing but rather an acceptance of the fluctuating nature of inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's understanding that economic indicators can be variable."
2,"There should be able to be an adjustment that would have lower than—perhaps lower-than-expected increases in unemployment—lower than would be expected in the ordinary course of events because the level—the ratio of, of vacancies to unemployed is just out of keeping with historical experience.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC anticipates the possibility of making adjustments that could lead to lower-than-expected increases in unemployment, which implies a stance towards easing monetary policy. The reference to the high ratio of vacancies to unemployed indicates that the labor market is tighter than usual, which could typically lead to inflationary pressures. However, the statement implies that the FOMC might be willing to tolerate or address these pressures with measures that do not significantly increase unemployment, aligning with a dovish approach that prioritizes employment over immediate inflation concerns."
0,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that both monetary and fiscal policies should be used to stimulate growth, suggesting an inclination towards easing monetary policy to support economic expansion. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of supporting maximum employment, as stimulating growth typically involves measures that make monetary conditions more accommodative."
1,And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings—that’s what we’re looking for.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing inflation, suggesting that the FOMC is looking for a consistent decrease in inflation rates. This implies a stance towards tightening monetary policy to achieve the goal of price stability, which aligns with a hawkish approach. The Committee's desire to see a ""series of declining monthly inflation readings"" reflects a commitment to curbing inflation, which may involve increasing interest rates or taking other measures to restrict monetary supply."
2,"What we really mean is that we would look at—we know that inflation will move around on both sides of the target, and what we say is that we would be equally concerned with inflation persistently above as persistently below the target.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a balanced approach to inflation management, suggesting that the FOMC is equally concerned with inflation rates both above and below their target. This implies a commitment to adjusting policy as needed to maintain their inflation goal without a current bias towards tightening or easing."
2,"So let me talk about the coronavirus specifically, and then I’ll turn more to global growth more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a prelude to a discussion about the impact of the coronavirus on the economy and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It suggests that the speaker is about to provide an assessment of the situation rather than signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy,","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that wage growth is one of many factors considered in determining monetary policy, but it is not the sole determinant. This suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, where wage growth is not the only indicator driving decisions. The statement does not explicitly signal a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an acknowledgment of the complexity of economic indicators and their impact on policy decisions."
1,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is an acknowledgment of a forecasting error regarding economic growth expectations. This statement does not provide information on the Committee's plans for adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools, nor does it directly relate to the current state of employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral comment on past projections and does not signal a clear policy direction."
2,"I mean, we—the—again, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation is weak, has been weak.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the relationship between economic slack (unused economic capacity) and inflation is weak, implying that even if there is slack in the economy, it may not lead to lower inflation as one might expect. This could be interpreted as a dovish stance because it indicates that the FOMC may not need to tighten monetary policy aggressively to control inflation if inflation is not rising due to economic slack. In other words, the FOMC might be more inclined to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, as the risk of inflation due to slack is perceived to be low."
2,"Looking ahead, FOMC participants project the unemployment rate to continue to decline; the median projection is 5 percent at the end of next year and moves below 4 percent by 2023.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC participants expect the unemployment rate to decline, reaching levels that are potentially below the natural rate of unemployment. This projection could signal a tightening labor market, which often leads to inflationary pressures due to increased wages as employers compete for a smaller pool of unemployed workers. In response to such a scenario, the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2% target for some time. This suggests that the FOMC may be less inclined to take immediate action to tighten monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures, as they are tolerating a higher level of inflation temporarily. However, the stance is considered HAWKISH because it implies that the FOMC is anticipating future actions to raise interest rates or otherwise tighten policy to bring inflation back down to the target level after it has been allowed to run higher. This forward-looking approach to potentially counteract inflationary pressures aligns with a HAWKISH stance, as it suggests readiness to tighten policy to maintain price stability."
1,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where, despite slow overall economic growth and disappointing productivity, the labor market is still generating a significant number of jobs each month. This indicates a mixed economic situation where there is both a negative aspect (slow growth and productivity) and a positive aspect (steady job creation). The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an observation of the current economic conditions. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment but does not directly address inflation or interest rate adjustments, making it a neutral statement in terms of monetary policy stance."
2,"And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And we’ve talked about the effects on asset prices,"" does not provide enough context to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It merely indicates a discussion about the impact of monetary policy on asset prices without suggesting a direction for policy adjustment. The stance could be hawkish or dovish depending on whether the effects discussed are seen as a reason to tighten or ease policy, but without additional information, the stance is neutral."
2,"But I do think that—and I do think also that unemployment insurance benefits will run out in September, so to the extent that’s a factor, which is not clear, it will no longer be a factor fairly soon.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential impact of unemployment insurance benefits on the labor market and acknowledges uncertainty about this impact. It also notes that these benefits are set to expire, which could change the current situation. The statement does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an observation on a factor that may influence the labor market and, by extension, monetary policy decisions. The focus is on a specific event (expiration of benefits) and its uncertain effect, without a clear directional stance on policy adjustments."
2,"So you’re talking about the inflation target, basically.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a clarification question about the inflation target and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy actions such as tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor provides insight into the Committee's view on economic conditions relative to their objectives."
2,"We have a much more resilient, stronger banking system, and we’re not seeing some worrisome buildup in leverage or credit growth at successive levels.1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to,","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the banking system is currently resilient and strong, and there is no concerning increase in leverage or credit growth. This suggests that the FOMC is monitoring these factors but does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement reflects an assessment of current conditions rather than a policy stance."
1,"To do that you've got to have price stability, and we've got to get back to price stability so that we can have a labor market where people's wages aren't being eaten up by inflation and where we can have a long expansion too.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the need to return to price stability to prevent inflation from eroding wages and to sustain a long economic expansion. This suggests a focus on controlling inflation, which typically involves tightening monetary policy to reduce inflationary pressures, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,"It was to do with, you know, strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus into an economy that was recovering rapidly, and in which there were these supply-side barriers which effectively led to, you know, in certain parts of the economy, what you might call a vertical supply curve.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the combination of strong monetary policy and fiscal stimulus was applied to an economy that was already recovering quickly, and this was occurring in the context of supply-side constraints. The mention of a ""vertical supply curve"" suggests that additional demand (from fiscal and monetary stimulus) could not be met with increased supply, which typically leads to higher prices—inflation. In this context, a ""strong monetary policy"" likely refers to a policy stance that is aimed at containing inflationary pressures, which would be consistent with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Thus, the stance is hawkish, as it indicates a concern about inflation and the potential need to tighten policy to maintain price stability."
2,"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely states an observation regarding the coexistence of low unemployment with social problems, without suggesting any particular monetary policy action or implication. This statement could be part of a broader discussion on economic conditions, but it does not, in itself, signal a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
1,And—but inflation expectations did not move strongly down here in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that inflation expectations remained relatively stable, neither rising significantly (which might suggest a hawkish stance to combat inflation) nor falling significantly (which might suggest a dovish stance due to deflationary concerns). The stability in inflation expectations suggests that the FOMC's current policy stance may be appropriate, and there is no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy based on this information alone."
0,"But many other commodity prices have fallen further, and the reason I would give for that is that the emerging markets—China, the rest of Asia, and some other parts of the world—plus Europe, of course, are softer, and so global commodity demand is weaker.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is a decline in global commodity demand due to softer economic conditions in emerging markets and Europe. This suggests that there is less inflationary pressure from commodity prices, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could be seen as a reason to maintain or ease monetary policy to support economic activity, as lower commodity prices may reduce the risk of inflation overshooting the target."
0,"We, frankly, didn’t even get inflation back up to target—without seeing wages getting out of touch with—with where they should be, so that’s the—that’s the biggest thing we can do.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that inflation has not reached the target level and that wages have not increased excessively, suggesting that there is no immediate need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. This indicates a stance towards easing or maintaining the current policy to support employment and help inflation rise to the target level."
0,I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""I think that keeping interest rates low is still appropriate for our economy"" suggests a stance in favor of maintaining an accommodative monetary policy to support economic activity. This implies that the speaker does not see immediate inflationary pressures that would warrant tightening monetary policy through higher interest rates. The dovish stance aligns with the goal of supporting employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
1,And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It simply states an observation that prices are rising from their lowest points, which could be part of a normal economic fluctuation. Without additional context on the speed or implications of these price movements, it is not possible to determine whether this would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is considered neutral."
2,And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And that’s because of this misalignment between supply and demand."" does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a reason for an economic condition, which could be related to either inflation or employment issues. Without additional context on whether the misalignment is causing inflation to rise or fall, or how it is affecting employment, it is not possible to determine a clear monetary policy stance. The sentence reflects an acknowledgment of economic factors that the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions, but it does not suggest a specific direction of policy adjustment."
2,"You know, monetary policy is a forward-looking exercise, and I’m going to—I’m just going to stick with that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, whether tightening or easing. It simply states a principle of monetary policy being forward-looking, which is a general approach to policy-making that considers future economic conditions and risks. This statement reflects a balanced view without indicating a clear stance towards either a more aggressive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) monetary policy."
2,"And so what that means is the Federal Reserve cannot add monetary accommodation by cutting short-term interest rates, the usual approach.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve is unable to provide additional monetary easing through its typical method of cutting short-term interest rates. This suggests that the current policy stance is not geared towards further easing, which could be interpreted as a signal of a tighter monetary policy environment, or at least the absence of additional dovish measures."
2,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about economic growth expectations rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an outlook on economic growth. The growth rate mentioned is relatively healthy and does not, in itself, indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"In coming months, as those earlier declines drop out of the calculation, inflation should move up closer to 2 percent and stabilize around that level over the medium term.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will align with the FOMC's long-term target of 2 percent, suggesting neither an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy. It reflects a forecast that is consistent with the Committee's goals, without signaling a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
2,It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It would consist of inflation plus—plus productivity growth"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it seems to describe a factor or a formula that might be considered in the context of economic analysis or policy setting. The mention of inflation and productivity growth does not inherently suggest a stance on the current monetary policy but rather points to components that could influence the FOMC's decisions. Inflation is a key concern for the FOMC, and productivity growth can impact both inflation and employment, but without additional context, the sentence does not advocate for a specific policy action."
1,"And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an intention to tighten monetary policy by gradually increasing interest rates over the year, assuming the economy progresses as expected and risks remain balanced. This approach aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, particularly if the economy is showing signs of growth that could lead to inflationary pressures. The use of ""remove accommodation"" refers to the reduction of monetary support, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
1,"In the near term, 12-month measures of PCE inflation are expected to move above 2 percent as the very low readings from early in the pandemic fall out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices pass through to consumer energy prices.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that inflation will rise above the FOMC's target of 2 percent in the near term, which could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract higher inflation. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and may prompt actions to prevent inflation from rising too much, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"If we—if we analyze inflation data and conclude that, clearly, transitory influences are holding down inflation, I do not want to say that we would respond to that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a cautious approach to interpreting inflation data, suggesting that the FOMC would not necessarily react to what it perceives as transitory influences on inflation. This implies a wait-and-see attitude, which is neither explicitly suggesting tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It reflects a balanced stance, focused on analyzing data thoroughly before making a policy decision, in line with the FOMC's commitment to informed and measured responses to economic indicators."
2,"So, as I mentioned, we’re going to be looking at all of those things: activity, labor market, inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a comprehensive approach by considering various economic indicators such as activity, labor market conditions, and inflation. This suggests a balanced stance where they are neither signaling an immediate intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but are instead assessing a range of factors to inform their future decisions. This aligns with their commitment to their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy adjustment."
1,"By contrast, raising rates too slowly would raise the risk that monetary policy would need to tighten abruptly down the road, which could jeopardize the economic expansion.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that if interest rates are not increased at a sufficient pace, there might be a need for a sudden and more aggressive tightening of monetary policy in the future, which could harm economic growth. This suggests a bias towards a tighter monetary policy to prevent such a scenario, aligning with a hawkish stance."
