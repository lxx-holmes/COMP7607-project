2,"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the compatibility of inflation targeting with various social priorities on inflation and unemployment, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustment. It is a theoretical observation on the flexibility of inflation targeting frameworks rather than a statement of policy intent."
2,"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where corporate profits are strong and have positively influenced both economists' outlooks and investor behavior, leading to a rise in stock prices. This statement is merely an observation of economic conditions and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. It is a neutral comment on the state of the economy without a clear implication for future policy moves."
0,"What I have elsewhere referred to as ""currency competition"" may be a driving force behind these changes in inflation outcomes and expectations and may be reflected in low nominal long-term interest rates and the flattening of yield curves.5 Iâ€™d like to briefly review what I mean by currency competition.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""currency competition"" and its potential impact on inflation outcomes, expectations, and long-term interest rates, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests a consideration of various factors that might influence the economic environment, but it does not explicitly suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on explaining a phenomenon rather than outlining a specific policy response."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it describes an economic condition where increased national saving is contributing to economic growth. This statement is more of an observation of economic activity rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a particular direction for policy adjustments."
0,"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to continue with the current pace of asset purchases until there is substantial progress towards the goals of maximum employment and price stability. This suggests a policy of monetary easing aimed at stimulating economic activity and supporting the labor market, which is consistent with a dovish stance. The use of asset purchases is typically a tool to inject liquidity into the economy, lower interest rates, and encourage borrowing and investment when the economy is not performing at its full potential, particularly when inflation is below the target level and employment is below its maximum sustainable level."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations as a principle for successful monetary policy, without indicating a current direction for policy adjustment. It emphasizes the role of expectations in achieving stability but does not suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that current inflation expectations are stable enough that fluctuations in energy prices do not significantly impact core inflation, and therefore do not necessitate a strong monetary policy response. This suggests a balanced view where the FOMC does not see a need to either tighten or ease policy specifically in response to energy price volatility, as it does not lead to a significant change in inflation dynamics. The statement reflects an understanding of the relationship between energy prices and core inflation but does not commit to any particular policy action, thus it is neutral."
1,"Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between various interest rates and asset prices and their effects on the cost of borrowing and aggregate demand. It does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the mechanics of how changes in rates can influence economic activity. This reflects an understanding of the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy without a clear policy direction."
2,"Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of indexed bonds and how their returns are calculated based on forecasts of price indexes. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides information on how certain financial instruments operate in relation to inflation expectations, which is a neutral statement in the context of monetary policy actions."
2,"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the difficulty of predicting asset price bubbles and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects on the challenges of forecasting economic events that could impact the FOMC's goals but does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy."
2,"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the attractiveness of investing in Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) due to improvements in their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks, as well as growth differentials that may reflect these improvements. This statement is descriptive and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment concerns nor does it signal contentment with the current economic conditions in relation to the FOMC's goals. Instead, it provides an observation on the international economic environment, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its comprehensive analysis but does not in itself dictate a specific policy action."
0,"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining a low federal funds rate until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. This suggests an easing stance, as the FOMC is signaling that it will not tighten monetary policy (i.e., raise interest rates) until there is clear evidence of maximum employment, a return to the 2% inflation target, and an expectation that inflation will moderately exceed this target for some time. This approach is aimed at supporting economic activity and ensuring that employment and inflation goals are met before considering policy tightening."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an expectation of economic recovery and improvement in the labor market, which is a neutral stance. It does not directly suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather indicates a wait-and-see approach as the economy begins to grow and the unemployment rate starts to decline. The statement is balanced, reflecting an anticipation of positive economic developments without committing to a specific monetary policy action."
2,"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general statement about the Vice Chair's approach to understanding the interaction between financial markets and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes an intention to consider various sources of information to inform policy decisions. The focus on integrating signals from different sources suggests a balanced approach to policy-making, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and data-driven decisions."
2,His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future monetary policy but rather discusses a general economic principle related to market systems and the use of knowledge and information. It does not provide information on the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the key indicators for determining their monetary policy stance."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support growth and employment when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle regarding the relationship between money growth, inflation, and the business cycle without indicating a current policy action or direction. It suggests that a stable rate of money growth could theoretically control inflation and stabilize the business cycle under certain conditions (stable and not particularly interest-sensitive money demand), but it does not commit to any immediate policy changes or indicate a clear stance on the current economic situation. The focus is on the long-term effects of a constant money growth rate rather than short-term policy adjustments."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the limitations of the Federal Reserve's authority and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply clarifies the scope of the Fed's functions, which is unrelated to the immediate direction of monetary policy adjustments."
1,"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of inflation trends, with an expectation of a modest increase from a low base. It does not explicitly suggest a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the inflation situation. The use of ""modest increase"" and ""very low rate"" implies that inflation is under control and within a manageable range, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement seems to be simply reporting on the state of inflation without indicating a clear direction for policy change."
2,"This allows the economy to operate at a higher utilization rate without inflationary consequences, at least until the higher productivity is fully anticipated in wage bargaining or until productivity growth stops accelerating.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the economy can sustain a higher utilization rate without immediate inflationary consequences due to increasing productivity. It implies a balance between economic growth (higher utilization) and price stability (no inflationary consequences). The statement does not directly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather observes a condition under which current policy can be maintained without adverse effects on inflation. It reflects an understanding of the dynamic relationship between employment, inflation, and productivity growth, without indicating a clear shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Still, if aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply follow the paths that I outlined earlier, the slack in resource utilization should diminish, unit labor costs should begin to move higher, and the underlying rate of inflation should stabilize.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies an expectation of increasing unit labor costs and stabilizing inflation, which suggests that the slack in the economy is reducing. This could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance. The anticipation of diminishing slack in resource utilization aligns with the goal of maximum employment, while the expectation of stabilizing inflation is consistent with the target of stable prices. If these conditions are met, it could justify a move towards a tighter monetary policy to maintain the balance between these objectives."
2,"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a regional economic observation regarding unemployment rates and migration patterns within South Dakota, specifically between metropolitan and rural areas. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on employment distribution, which is one aspect of the broader economic considerations the FOMC takes into account when making policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is a formal introductory remark expressing gratitude for the opportunity to speak at an event. It does not contain any information about monetary policy actions or stances, such as adjustments to the federal funds rate or views on inflation and employment. Therefore, it does not indicate a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy but is simply a neutral, non-policy-related statement."
2,We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the structure of the U.S. government in comparison to other countries that target inflation. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it sets the stage for a discussion or rationale that may follow regarding how the U.S. government's form could impact the implementation of monetary policy. It does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy actions with respect to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's balancing act between fostering economic growth and preventing inflation, without indicating a current direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects the Committee's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as well as its moderate long-term interest rate goal. The statement emphasizes the need for a measured approach to policy that neither overly stimulates nor restricts economic growth, which is consistent with a neutral policy stance."
2,One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a monetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical contribution to monetary policy analysis, specifically a method for forecasting inflation, but does not indicate a current policy stance or suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is simply a statement about a forecasting approach without any direct implication for current monetary policy decisions."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential development of financial market instruments and analytical techniques to measure changes in the general price level, which is related to inflation tracking. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a neutral, informative perspective on the tools that may help in understanding inflation trends, which is part of the FOMC's broader goal of maintaining stable prices."
1,"There is much about the inflation process that we do not understand, and I have been surprised at the extent of the pickup in core inflation this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about higher-than-expected core inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract inflationary pressures. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. The surprise at the extent of the pickup in core inflation implies that the current inflation rate may be deviating from their target, which could lead to actions such as raising interest rates to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level."
1,"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the actual unemployment rate may be higher than the reported headline unemployment rate due to adjustments for labor force participation and misclassification. This suggests that the labor market is weaker than it appears, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support employment, aligning with a dovish approach to stimulate economic activity and job growth."
2,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to forecasting the economy's path towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. It indicates that the forecasts will reflect participants' views on the short-run variability of output and inflation but does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the Committee's commitment to adjusting forecasts and policy as needed to achieve its dual mandate, without a clear direction towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the components of multifactor productivity and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a factual statement about the factors that contribute to productivity, which is relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself suggest a policy direction."
2,Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on setting the stage for a discussion on productivity and technology developments and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests imminent policy actions nor provides an assessment of economic conditions relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states a principle of economic theory that in the long run, full employment does not conflict with price stability. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not directly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply affirms the FOMC's commitment to its dual mandate without indicating a change in policy direction."
2,"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the current imbalances in demand and supply, including labor supply, but also expresses the judgment that these imbalances will dissipate over time without causing persistent upward pressure on inflation or deviating from the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective. This suggests that while there are current economic issues, the FOMC expects them to resolve without necessitating a change in monetary policy to either tighten or ease conditions, thus indicating a balanced or neutral stance."
2,"Thus, reducing vacancies from an extremely high level to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on unemployment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the number of job vacancies and the effects on hiring and unemployment, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates an observation of labor market conditions, which is part of the FOMC's assessment process, but does not in itself advocate for a tightening or easing of monetary policy. The statement is more about the dynamics of the labor market rather than a direct indication of future policy moves."
2,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests uncertainty about future inflation trends, which could lead to either an increase or decrease in policy intervention depending on how the situation evolves. The focus on the uncertainty of inflation's trajectory implies a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation potentially exceeding the 2% target by a significant margin (at or above 3%). The speaker's willingness to consider this an excessive overshoot suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity and cool down inflationary pressures."
0,"Though widely anticipated even before the actions of October, the recession and retrenchment in employment that followed those actions resulted in pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse course.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there was a recession and a decrease in employment, which led to pressures on the Federal Reserve to reverse its previous course of action. This suggests that there was a call for the Federal Reserve to potentially ease monetary policy to address the economic downturn and support employment, aligning with a dovish stance that favors looser monetary conditions to stimulate the economy."
0,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the exploration of alternative monetary policy tools, specifically yield curve caps in combination with forward guidance, to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy when interest rates are near the effective lower bound (ELB). This approach is neither explicitly tightening nor easing but rather focuses on the potential for more precise control of interest rates across different maturities. It suggests a readiness to adapt policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals but does not indicate a current stance on moving policy in a more hawkish or dovish direction."
2,"Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses).","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that a monopoly central bank issuing fiat money might not respond optimally during crises or cyclical variations, implying it would prioritize its own income (seigniorage) over minimizing inflation and output losses. This indicates a potential for a tighter monetary policy stance than might be optimal for economic stability, as the central bank would potentially charge more for liquidity during crises, which is a tightening action. The focus on maximizing income rather than targeting stable prices and maximum employment aligns with a hawkish stance, which is generally associated with higher interest rates and reduced liquidity provision."
2,Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes a method by which the FOMC might gauge inflation expectations without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. Survey measures of inflation expectations are one of many indicators the FOMC uses to assess economic conditions and guide its policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide information on whether inflation expectations are above or below the target level. It is a statement of fact regarding the tools used to measure expectations and does not in itself reflect a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"The severity of the 1981-82 recession, the worst of the postwar period, clearly illustrates the danger of letting inflation get out of control.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the negative consequences of high inflation and the importance of preventing it, which suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. This implies a willingness to raise interest rates or take other contractionary measures to keep inflation in check."
0,"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges an improving labor market but also points out an ongoing issue with labor shortages, which could potentially hinder economic growth. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes current economic conditions related to employment. It reflects the FOMC's mandate of maximum employment but does not provide a clear direction on how the Committee might adjust monetary policy in response to these conditions."
0,"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an economic rationale for the development of cities, specifically the concept of labor market pooling and its impact on productivity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides an observation on how specific labor market conditions can affect productivity and competitiveness, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader economic analysis. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any immediate action or change in monetary policy, thus it is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the modeling of the term structure of interest rates and how these models fit better when they assume changing inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function. This statement is more about the technical aspects of economic modeling rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a goal of returning the economy to a state of low unemployment and inflation near the FOMC's target of 2 percent, which is consistent with its mandate of maximum employment and price stability. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes an objective that the FOMC would consider ideal. This statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is willing to accept slower economic growth and higher unemployment as a trade-off for achieving price stability. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, even at the cost of potentially negative impacts on employment and economic growth, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an individual's belief that quantifying the price stability objective aligns with the current dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both price stability and maximum employment. However, it also acknowledges the complexity of communicating this change. The statement does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather discusses a matter of policy communication and transparency. It reflects a balanced view without a clear indication of a change in policy stance."
1,And the equity market itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices--a rise based apparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations' already robust long-term earning prospects.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an analysis of the equity market and the reasons behind the rise in equity prices, attributing it to upward revisions in long-term earnings estimates. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment of financial and economic conditions. The FOMC is acknowledging market dynamics without suggesting a particular policy response, which aligns with a neutral stance."
2,"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of deregulation, globalization, and innovation on citizens' ability to protect their wealth from inflation, as well as an increased public understanding of the costs of inflation due to historical experiences. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on economic behavior and inflation awareness."
0,"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of past currency movements and their correlation with trade balances, rather than indicating a future policy direction. It notes the impact of diverging interest rates on the dollar's value and the subsequent effect on exports and import prices, but does not suggest a specific monetary policy action. The statement is more of an economic analysis than a hint at tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the recent spike in inflation is temporary and not widespread across the economy. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as it is expected to subside on its own. This stance is consistent with a dovish approach, which would favor maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, rather than raising interest rates to fight inflation that is seen as transitory."
2,"At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of observation, analysis, and forward-looking policy formulation based on unexpected economic outcomes. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the Committee's approach to adapting its policy in response to economic data that does not match their expectations. This reflects a balanced and data-driven approach, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
1,"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about the potential negative impact of higher inflation on economic growth in the longer term. This concern is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it suggests that the FOMC might prioritize combating inflation to prevent it from harming long-term growth, potentially through tightening monetary policy. Tightening monetary policy could include raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
1,"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about high inflation levels and acknowledges uncertainty in the inflation outlook. This suggests a stance that would favor tightening monetary policy to bring inflation down towards the FOMC's target, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to reduce inflationary pressures."
1,"More than two years after the recession trough, and following several quarters of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that, based on historical patterns and the period of strong growth following a recession, the Federal Reserve would typically be in the process of tightening monetary policy at this stage. This suggests an expectation or a norm of moving towards a more restrictive policy stance to prevent the economy from overheating, which aligns with a hawkish outlook. Tightening policy often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation and ensure stable prices, one of the FOMC's key goals."
2,"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the technical aspects of economic measurement rather than directly suggesting a stance on monetary policy. It discusses the importance of clear and consistent definitions for measuring productivity and standards of living, which is a foundational concept in economics but does not indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes two simultaneous economic observations: a soaring stock market and moderating core inflation. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather presents a scenario where there is positive market performance alongside a favorable inflation trend. This could be seen as a balanced economic condition, which might not necessitate an immediate shift in monetary policy towards either tightening or easing. The FOMC might view this as a sign that previous policies are effective, or they might take a wait-and-see approach to determine if these trends continue."
2,"In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that adjustments to the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could be used to amplify the effects of changes in the short-term interest rate. Since the balance sheet typically expands through asset purchases during easing periods and contracts (or grows more slowly) during tightening periods, the mention of reinforcing policy communication associated with the short-term rate suggests that the Fed is considering using its balance sheet strategically to enhance the impact of interest rate hikes. This indicates a stance towards tightening monetary policy, which is consistent with a hawkish approach."
2,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" if the unemployment rate declines to a specific target (3.8 percent). This suggests that the labor market is moving towards a state that could potentially lead to inflationary pressures, which in turn could prompt the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to prevent overheating. The focus on achieving maximum employment without mentioning concerns about underemployment or low inflation implies a stance that could be more inclined towards preventing inflation, which is typically associated with a hawkish policy stance."
1,It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is robust enough to withstand a tightening of monetary policy, which typically involves increasing interest rates to control inflation. This implies a readiness to implement measures that would prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes curbing inflation and maintaining stable prices, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth."
2,"The specific price-stability target of an inflation rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, was announced as part of the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy following the January 2012 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the FOMC's inflation target and does not directly indicate a current policy stance or a future policy action. It simply provides information on the specific target for price stability that the FOMC has set, which is a cornerstone of their monetary policy framework. The sentence does not suggest whether the FOMC is inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather describes a long-term goal and strategy."
2,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. policy rate changes in response to inflationary pressures have a significant impact on emerging market (EM) financial conditions. This suggests that the Federal Reserve is willing to adjust policy rates to manage inflation, which aligns with a tightening of monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy in response to inflationary pressures is a characteristic of a hawkish stance."
1,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that with interest rates already low, the central bank has limited room to maneuver in the event of additional negative demand shocks. This suggests a recognition of the need to possibly raise rates or at least maintain them at the current level to preserve the ability to cut them in the future if necessary, which is indicative of a tightening bias in monetary policy."
2,"Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a correction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a cautious approach by policymakers, acknowledging the uncertainty in asset prices and the potential need for the economy to absorb corrections. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a consideration of economic resilience in the face of possible asset price volatility. This stance is consistent with a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (easing policy)."
2,"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of inflation has been relatively stable in Brazil, at around 5 percent, and it has been declining in Mexico, where it is now around 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed stability and decline in the variability of inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico, without directly suggesting any immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC. It is simply a statement of fact regarding inflation trends in these countries, which does not inherently indicate a change in the stance of monetary policy."
2,"In fact, applying a formal regression analysis to the full sample from 1989 to 2002, we found a number fairly close to this one, namely, a stock price multiplier for monetary policy of about 4.7.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the results of a formal regression analysis, estimating the impact of monetary policy on stock prices with a multiplier of 4.7. This statement is more of a technical observation rather than a direct indication of future policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an empirical finding that could be used to inform policy decisions. The sentence does not directly address the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it indicate a clear stance on adjusting the policy in response to economic conditions."
0,"In addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on the supply side of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy adjustment, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges potential long-term challenges to the economy's supply side, which could affect both inflation and employment. This suggests a balanced view, considering both demand and supply factors without committing to a specific policy action."
2,"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing an intention to discuss findings and implications from a review in the context of the FOMC's new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a communication of policy framework and strategy. The focus is on transparency and explanation of policy implications, which is a neutral action in terms of monetary policy stance."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation rates being persistently below the FOMC's 2% target, which could lead to lower long-term inflation expectations. The mention of ""makeup"" strategies suggests that some economists are advocating for measures to increase inflation to meet the target, which typically involves easing monetary policy. This stance is dovish as it implies a willingness to adopt policies that would stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the desired level."
2,"A key difference between the two groups of countries is that the countries whose current accounts have moved toward deficit have generally experienced substantial housing appreciation and increases in household wealth,","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions in certain countries, noting a correlation between current account deficits, housing appreciation, and increases in household wealth. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic developments that could influence future monetary policy decisions. The statement is factual and does not suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"multifactor productivity growth fell to a pace of 0.4 percent, the slowest pace of any of the periods shown on the table.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation regarding the pace of multifactor productivity growth without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects economic conditions relevant to the FOMC's assessment but does not in itself indicate a clear direction for policy change. The FOMC might consider such data when making decisions, but the sentence does not reveal a stance towards more hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) policy measures."
1,"Although the Fed hasn't started raising rates or reducing the balance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation of market conditions where interest rates have increased, but it does not directly suggest an action taken by the Federal Reserve to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is merely acknowledging a change in interest rates without attributing it to a specific policy stance by the Fed. It reflects an awareness of the economic environment, which is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making."
2,"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technological advancement in terms of the cost of computing power, which is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a direct indication of monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest a need for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the change in the price of a specific good over time. This could be relevant to discussions about productivity and inflation but does not in itself signal a clear direction for policy adjustments."
2,"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic context and the effects of global trade, competition, and increased productive capacity on American businesses and consumers, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It acknowledges factors that have led to low prices for consumers and reduced pricing power for businesses, which could be seen as contributing to stable prices, but does not suggest immediate action by the FOMC."
2,"In hindsight, the paths of inflation, real output, stock prices and exchange rates may have seemed preordained, but no such insight existed as we experienced it at the time.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on economic conditions without providing a clear direction on future monetary policy actions. It acknowledges the unpredictability of economic indicators such as inflation and output, but does not suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about the uncertainty and difficulty in forecasting economic conditions than about a specific policy stance."
2,"Prices, interest rates, stock prices, and other signals produced by market economies to encourage the distribution of productive resources have no inherent moral content.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a philosophical statement about the nature of economic signals and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather comments on the neutral character of market signals in terms of moral content. This statement does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
1,"While the current episode has not yet concluded, it appears that, responding vigorously in a relatively flexible economy to the aftermath of bubbles, as traumatic as that may be, is less inhibiting to long-term growth than chronic high-inflation monetary policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a preference for responding vigorously to economic disturbances, such as bubbles, even if the response is traumatic, over the long-term negative effects of a high-inflation monetary policy. This implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent high inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability, even at the cost of short-term economic disruption."
2,But what does this mean for monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But what does this mean for monetary policy?"" does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It is a question that suggests a consideration or assessment is to follow, but it does not indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy stance. Therefore, without additional context, the stance is unclear or balanced, which classifies it as neutral."
2,"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of global factors on U.S. term premiums and real interest rates, as well as the improved strength and resilience of the financial system due to better risk management and stronger regulation. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current economic conditions and regulatory improvements. The focus on global factors and the state of the financial system suggests a balanced view without a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
1,"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of price dynamics, specifically the asymmetric response of prices to cost shocks, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a phenomenon known as ""sticky prices"" on the downside, which is an observation about market behavior rather than a direct indicator for a policy change. This statement is more about the challenges in achieving stable prices and does not directly indicate a shift towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,What I do want to share with you is how the equity market fits into my thinking about monetary policy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments. It merely indicates that the speaker considers the equity market as one factor in the broader context of monetary policy decision-making. There is no clear indication of a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it suggest a balance between the two. It is a statement of consideration rather than action."
2,I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation"" is a statement of economic principle rather than a direct indication of policy action. It neither suggests an immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a need to ease policy to stimulate growth (which would be dovish). Instead, it reflects a neutral stance, acknowledging the complexity of the relationship between economic growth and inflation without committing to a specific policy direction."
1,"Of course, the basic problem in tackling the inflation of the 1970s is that we have one observation and many competing theories.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a reflection on the challenges faced in understanding and addressing the inflation of the 1970s, highlighting the difficulty in drawing conclusions from a single historical event with multiple theoretical interpretations. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a contemplative or academic perspective on past economic conditions rather than a directive or indication of future actions."
2,such costs appeared tolerable in light of the employment gains that came with them.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a balance between the costs associated with monetary policy actions and the benefits of employment gains. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a trade-off that the FOMC finds acceptable in pursuit of its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices. The tolerance for certain costs in exchange for employment gains implies a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, given a constant economic outlook. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a mechanism of how financial conditions might be affected by changes in market demand. The term premium is a component of interest rates that reflects the risk of holding longer-term bonds over short-term bonds. This statement is more about the dynamics of financial markets and does not explicitly suggest a move towards either a more aggressive or accommodative monetary policy."
2,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the release of mortgage price data and concerns about equal access to credit, which is more related to financial regulation and fairness in lending practices rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not provide clear signals about tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it directly address the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for efficient resource allocation and achieving maximum sustainable employment. This focus on price stability often implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to control inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish stance. The statement suggests that maintaining low and stable inflation is a priority, which could lead to actions such as raising interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the risk of higher inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to rebalance supply and demand and contain inflationary pressures. This aligns with the goal of stable prices and is consistent with a hawkish stance, which typically involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent excessive inflation."
0,"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the long-term implications of increases in productivity growth rates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not suggest immediate action towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a factor that can influence economic conditions over time. Higher productivity growth can lead to non-inflationary economic growth, which is generally positive for achieving the FOMC's goals, but the sentence does not provide enough context to determine a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target temporarily. This approach suggests that the FOMC is focused on ensuring that inflation does not fall persistently below its long-term goal, which could lead to deflationary pressures and an anchoring of inflation expectations at too low a level. By aiming for a period of higher inflation, the FOMC is signaling a readiness to potentially tighten monetary policy in the future to prevent inflation from becoming unanchored on the upside, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,This automatically pushes up domestic interest rates to support the currency.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that domestic interest rates are being increased to support the currency, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. Raising interest rates is typically associated with a hawkish stance, as it is used to control inflation and stabilize the currency, often at the expense of potentially slowing down economic growth. This action aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, which includes preventing excessive inflation."
1,"For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that a commitment to long-run price stability is crucial to maintain confidence in dollar-denominated assets and prevent a decline in the dollar's value, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This suggests that the Federal Reserve may need to maintain or tighten monetary policy to ensure price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement of fact regarding inflation levels in 1996 and does not directly indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent policy action nor reflects a commitment to adjust policy in response to changing economic conditions. It simply provides context about past inflation rates without a clear implication for current or future monetary policy actions."
2,The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) main instrument for conducting monetary policy without indicating a direction for future policy. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, thus it is considered a neutral statement."
2,"The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, inflation is close to our 2 percent objective, gross domestic product growth is solid, and the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) baseline outlook is for a continuation of this performance in 2020.2 At present, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price inflation is running somewhat below our 2 percent objective,","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an assessment of current economic conditions, noting strong employment, solid GDP growth, and inflation near the target level, but also acknowledges that PCE price inflation is slightly below the 2 percent objective. This suggests a balanced view of the economy, with no clear indication of a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy imminently. The statement reflects contentment with the current state of the economy while recognizing a minor deviation in inflation, without signaling a clear direction for future policy changes."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed correlation between the decline in term premiums and the decrease in long-run inflation uncertainty as well as short-term interest rate uncertainty since 1990. This statement is primarily analytical, reflecting on past economic conditions and trends without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on historical market conditions."
2,"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation about the relationship between money growth targets and econometric estimates of money demand, specifically mentioning a period in the mid-1970s. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects on the challenges of predicting economic indicators and the potential discrepancies between targets and actual outcomes. This historical context does not suggest an immediate action towards either increasing or decreasing the interest rates or adjusting monetary supply, thus it is considered neutral in terms of policy stance."
2,"With respect to this particular part of the District, Jack may discuss Florida's citrus crop, the relative health of the tourism industry, and trends in Florida real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a regional economic update, which is a common part of FOMC discussions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions in a specific area. Discussing the citrus crop, tourism, and real estate trends in Florida does not inherently suggest a tightening or easing of policy but is part of the broader analysis the FOMC undertakes to understand the economic landscape."
0,"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential feedback loop where declines in wealth could negatively impact economic activity, which in turn could affect financial markets. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges a risk scenario that the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions. It reflects an awareness of economic conditions and financial stability concerns, which are part of the broader context in which the FOMC operates, but it does not commit to a specific monetary policy action."
0,"What modern monetary policymaking has not faced for quite some time, if ever, has been a major surge in innovation--matching, if not exceeding, the other great waves this century--followed by an apparent elevation of productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there has been a significant increase in innovation and a subsequent rise in productivity growth. This observation does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on economic conditions that could potentially impact the FOMC's policy decisions. Higher productivity growth can lead to economic expansion without necessarily increasing inflation, which might not require an immediate policy response. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the FOMC would adjust its policy to be more hawkish or dovish in response to these conditions."
1,"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement regarding the U.S. current account deficit and the trade balance, specifically the difference between the value of imports and exports. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC in terms of tightening or easing. The focus is on the balance of payments rather than on employment, inflation, or interest rates, which are the primary concerns of the FOMC when determining monetary policy."
0,"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the observed effects of fiscal policy measures on household spending, noting an increase due to stimulus payments and unemployment benefits. It also discusses the potential impact of these measures on the economic recovery, depending on future fiscal support. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather provides an assessment of the economic situation and the role of fiscal policy. It suggests that the economic recovery is being supported by fiscal measures, but it does not imply any immediate action by the FOMC regarding monetary policy."
2,"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation regarding the role of inflation in promoting financial innovation in Brazil, which helped firms and households reduce their need for cash. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy in terms of tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on how inflation can influence economic behavior, which is a neutral statement in terms of policy direction."
2,There is no evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that despite a strong labor market, there is no sign of excessive inflationary pressure resulting from increased costs. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, as the strong labor market is not leading to the kind of wage growth that could drive prices significantly higher. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally more accommodative and less concerned with immediate inflationary pressures, especially when they are not evident."
2,"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical observation about the methodology of studies concerning price indexes and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation or employment nor provides insight into the Committee's future actions. It simply describes an aspect of the data analysis that the FOMC might consider in its decision-making process."
0,Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by mid-2003.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical assessment stating that the goal of price stability had been achieved in the past. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy at the present time. Instead, it provides a retrospective view that the FOMC's target for price stability was met according to most analysts at that time. This statement does not offer insight into current or future policy actions."
1,"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes in taking early action to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which can lead to longer periods of economic growth without high inflation or significant fluctuations in output. This stance is consistent with a focus on preventing inflation from rising above the target level, which is a key aspect of a hawkish monetary policy approach. The use of the term ""policy restraint"" indicates a preference for measures that would slow down economic expansion before it leads to excesses, which is a typical characteristic of a hawkish stance."
2,"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the importance of inflation expectations as a factor in monetary policy assessment, alongside the natural rate of unemployment (u*) and the neutral rate of interest (r*). It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) but rather emphasizes the role of inflation expectations in the decision-making process. This reflects a balanced approach to considering various indicators when formulating policy, in line with the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"For example, Kozicki and Tinsley (2001) show that it is far easier to make sense of the term structure of Treasury yields if one assumes that expectations about long-run inflation adjust in a reasonable adaptive manner.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a study on the term structure of Treasury yields and how expectations about long-run inflation might adjust, which is more of an analytical observation rather than a direct indication of current or future monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific direction on the future of monetary policy but rather indicates that the speaker will discuss the use of forward guidance as a tool. It sets the stage for a discussion on policy tools without revealing any particular stance on whether the policy will be tightened or eased."
2,"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of policymakers updating their estimates of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the output gap based on the latest economic data. This approach reflects a balanced and data-driven stance, without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a commitment to informed decision-making to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, but does not signal a specific policy direction."
2,"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering a review of its strategy, tools, and communication practices to ensure they are effectively achieving their goals. The mention of the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability suggests that the current policy stance is appropriate, but the Committee is open to adjustments if necessary. This does not clearly signal an immediate intent to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather shows a willingness to adapt and optimize their approach, which is a neutral stance."
2,"Inflation-targeting regimes make sense only if the central bank has independent control of the instruments of monetary policy, as holding the central bank responsible for meeting its inflation target is hardly possible otherwise.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a general principle of inflation-targeting regimes, stating that they are effective only if the central bank can independently control its monetary policy instruments. This is a statement about the structure and prerequisites for effective monetary policy rather than an indication of the current policy stance or future policy actions. It does not directly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"For all these conceptual uncertainties and measurement problems, a specific numerical inflation target would represent an unhelpful and false precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses skepticism about the usefulness of a specific numerical inflation target due to uncertainties and measurement issues. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather questions the precision of targeting a specific inflation number. This stance is neutral as it neither commits to action to combat inflation (hawkish) nor suggests a need for more accommodative policy to boost inflation or employment (dovish). It reflects a balanced view on the challenges of setting and achieving precise policy targets."
2,"Once this process is completed, however, we might expect consumer price inflation to move into better alignment with long-run expectations and thus settle in around 2 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that the FOMC expects inflation to align with their long-term goal of 2 percent, indicating neither an immediate tightening nor easing of monetary policy. It reflects a belief that the current policy path will lead to desired outcomes without specifying any changes to the policy stance."
1,"These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargentâ€™s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the potential for a high-inflation equilibrium, which suggests a focus on preventing or combating higher inflation. This concern aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies the need for tighter monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1/4 percentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10 Finally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views regarding the debt's sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that non-oil import prices are falling, which suggests a reduction in inflationary pressures, particularly in the core inflation measure that excludes volatile food and energy prices. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation. The mention of the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and its sustainability also suggests a consideration of fiscal policy's effects, which can interact with monetary policy but does not directly indicate a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges a limitation in the data, which does not clearly support an optimistic view of productivity improvements. This statement does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it does not directly relate to inflation or employment targets. It is more of an observation on economic conditions rather than a signal of future policy actions."
2,"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in measuring quality changes in personal computers and how these changes may not be fully reflected in published price indexes. This statement is more about the accuracy of economic data rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy, hence it is classified as neutral. It reflects the Committee's awareness of the complexities in economic measurements, which is important for informed policy decisions, but does not in itself indicate a policy direction."
2,"For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply describing a method for measuring inflation, specifically the 12-month change in core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices, which is used to gauge the underlying rate of inflation. It does not indicate a particular direction for monetary policy but rather refers to a tool for assessing economic conditions related to the FOMC's price stability mandate. The stance of monetary policy would depend on the actual level and trend of the core PCE prices relative to the Committee's inflation target, which is not provided in the sentence."
2,"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a general statement about the speaker's intention to discuss various topics, including the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and the new monetary policy framework. It does not provide any specific information on the direction of monetary policy or indicate a stance towards tightening or easing. It is simply an introductory remark and does not reflect a commitment to any particular policy action."
1,"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a statement about economic growth potential, which could be influenced by various factors, including past monetary policy actions. However, without additional context on whether this growth is leading to inflationary pressures or is in line with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, it is not possible to classify the stance as hawkish or dovish. The sentence is neutral as it simply provides an outlook on GDP growth without specifying the implications for monetary policy adjustments."
1,"I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a clear intention to continue tightening monetary policy through additional rate increases until there is significant progress in reducing inflation. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, which focuses on combating inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth. The commitment to rate hikes aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, specifically targeting a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the frequency of the Chairman's testimonies before Congress and does not provide any direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It merely states a historical fact about the number of appearances in a given year and specifies that only some of those were directly related to monetary policy. There is no information in the sentence that suggests a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, nor does it comment on the current economic conditions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the complexity of inflation dynamics and suggests that there are multiple factors influencing inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not commit to either a tightening or easing of policy, but rather implies a need for further analysis and understanding of the various factors at play. This balanced approach aligns with the FOMC's principle of considering a wide range of indicators and balancing risks when making policy decisions."
2,"That is, monetary policy responds to changes in fiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equity prices, exchange rates, or the demand for U.S. exports due to changed growth prospects abroad.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy as being responsive to various economic factors, including fiscal policy changes, but does not indicate a specific direction (tightening or easing) of policy adjustment. It suggests that the FOMC considers a wide range of economic indicators and external influences when making decisions, aiming to maintain its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence implies a balanced and reactive stance rather than a proactive move towards either a more hawkish or dovish policy."
2,"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strong commitment to achieving price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By stating that price stability is ""fully under the control of monetary policymakers,"" it suggests that the FOMC is willing to use its tools, such as adjusting the federal funds rate, to ensure inflation remains in check. This stance is typically considered hawkish, as it indicates a readiness to tighten monetary policy to maintain stable prices, aligning with the FOMC's goal of a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
1,"I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is posing a question about the potential impact of a hypothetical situation (a sharp rise in the price of oil) on the U.S. economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a consideration of external economic factors that could influence the FOMC's future policy decisions. The FOMC's response to such a scenario would depend on how the rise in oil prices might affect employment, inflation, and long-term interest rates, and the sentence does not provide information on what the Committee's assessment or response would be."
2,"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is procedural and does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It simply states that there will be a presentation on policy alternatives, without giving any hint as to whether the policy will be tightened, eased, or remain the same."
2,Some Reasons for the Decline in Far-Forward Rates Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about the reasons behind the decline in far-forward rates, which are interest rates expected to prevail in the distant future, as implied by the current term structure of interest rates. This question does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an analysis or inquiry into market conditions and interest rate trends, which could be part of the FOMC's broader assessment of the economic landscape. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's intended actions or its outlook on economic conditions in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Another clear attempt at political interference emerged in February 1988 when an undersecretary of the Treasury sent a letter to Federal Reserve officials urging them to ease monetary policy.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates a push from an external political entity for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy, which typically means reducing interest rates or taking other actions to stimulate economic activity. Easing monetary policy is associated with a dovish stance, as it aims to support economic growth and increase employment, often at the risk of higher inflation."
1,"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical perspective on the cause of rising oil prices in the 1970s, attributing it to a perceived permanent shift in global demand and supply balances. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context or background information on past economic conditions, which does not inherently suggest an immediate action or reaction by the FOMC in terms of current monetary policy."
1,"Even so, the growth of investment spending over this period noticeably outpaced the rise in retained earnings, and thus these corporations turned to the capital markets to fill the widening gap.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where investment spending by corporations has grown faster than their retained earnings, leading them to seek additional funds through capital markets. This observation is a neutral statement of economic conditions and does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It neither suggests an overheating economy that would require a hawkish response, nor does it imply economic weakness that would call for a dovish approach. It simply reports on corporate financial behavior without a clear implication for the FOMC's monetary policy goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,Most analysts would contend that U.S. interest rates were lowered by the world's accumulation of dollars.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that U.S. interest rates were reduced due to external factors, specifically the global accumulation of dollars. Lower interest rates are typically associated with a dovish stance, as they indicate a move towards easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity. This could be seen as a response to promote maximum employment and stable prices, in line with the FOMC's objectives, especially if the accumulation of dollars was leading to deflationary pressures or economic slowdown."
2,One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an opinion held by a group of economists regarding the relationship between monetary policy and financial market bubbles, but it does not directly indicate a current stance of the FOMC towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement about a viewpoint rather than a description of policy action or intent."
2,"Under pure monetary targeting, interest rates would fluctuate with shocks in spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical approach to monetary policy, stating that under a regime of pure monetary targeting, interest rates would naturally respond to changes in spending due to economic shocks. This statement does not indicate a current policy stance of tightening or easing but rather explains a concept related to how monetary policy could operate. It does not provide information on the current or future direction of policy in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to raising inflation to the 2 percent target, suggesting that if inflation has been persistently below this level, the Committee is prepared to allow it to run moderately above 2 percent for some time to balance out the average. This implies a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising too much, reflecting a hawkish stance. The focus on anchoring expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability shows a proactive approach to managing inflation, which is often associated with a hawkish policy stance."
2,"In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the behavior of various estimates of the natural rate of interest (r*) and expected inflation, noting that they have moved broadly together over time. This statement does not directly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an analysis of economic indicators, which is consistent with the FOMC's data-driven approach to policy decisions. The sentence does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"For example, the shift in manufacturing production from artisanal shops in the mid-1800s to factories after the Civil War led to a disproportionate increase in the demand for unskilled labor to operate the new machines.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical shift in manufacturing production and its impact on labor demand, which is a factual statement about economic history rather than a current monetary policy stance. It does not directly indicate any intention to tighten or ease monetary policy in the context of the FOMC's current objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about credit access, particularly in the subprime mortgage market, without directly indicating a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It neither suggests an imminent change in policy to address inflation nor employment concerns, nor does it imply a reaction to economic disturbances. Instead, it simply notes the increased availability of credit to a broader range of households."
2,"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a method for analyzing long-term interest rates by looking at forward rates, which are expected to be unaffected by current cyclical shocks. This approach is used to understand market expectations of future short-term interest rates without the noise of current economic fluctuations. The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather describes a technique for assessing long-term economic conditions. It reflects a neutral, analytical perspective on interpreting economic indicators, which is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making."
2,The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a confidence in the current policy framework's ability to address economic challenges, suggesting that the FOMC believes its existing strategy is appropriate for the current economic conditions. This statement is balanced and does not lean towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical market reaction to expectations of the Federal Reserve's tapering (reducing asset purchases), which led to higher interest rates and increased market volatility. It focuses on the impact of these expectations on emerging market economies (EMEs), particularly on their exchange rates and asset prices. This statement does not directly indicate a current stance of monetary policy but rather discusses the consequences of past market anticipations. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but reflects on the effects of a previous policy expectation."
2,"October 19, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and Initiatives to Sustain the Flow of Credit to Households and Firms Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols,","NEUTRAL

The sentence is introductory in nature and does not provide any specific information about the stance of monetary policy. It merely sets the stage for Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida's conversation at an event and does not discuss monetary policy actions or intentions regarding the federal funds rate, inflation, or employment."
2,This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a past assessment of inflation forecasting without directly indicating a future policy action or a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply acknowledges a discrepancy between expected and actual inflation outcomes, which is part of the normal review and analysis process of the FOMC. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether this will lead to a more hawkish or dovish policy response."
2,"Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Even so, the growth rate of the ECI did not return to the levels experienced before 2008"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which is a measure of wage inflation and can be an indicator of overall inflationary pressures. The fact that the ECI growth rate has not returned to pre-2008 levels could be interpreted in various ways, depending on the context. It does not inherently suggest that the FOMC should either increase or decrease the federal funds rate or take other monetary policy actions. Therefore, without additional context that would suggest how the FOMC might respond to this information, the statement is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,Productivity is a cyclical variable that typically falls in recessions.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply describes a characteristic of productivity as it relates to economic cycles, without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening nor easing of policy but rather provides an observation on economic behavior during recessions."
1,"Nonetheless, the leveling off in that disturbing trend is an encouraging sign of what we can achieve if we can maintain strong and flexible labor markets accompanied by low inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a positive outlook on the current economic situation, where strong and flexible labor markets are seen alongside low inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals. It does not explicitly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather reflects satisfaction with the current state of economic indicators. The use of ""encouraging sign"" implies that the FOMC's goals are being met without suggesting immediate action to change the policy stance."
2,"When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, in large part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that long-term interest rates are rising due to expectations of higher short-term interest rates, which typically occur when the central bank is expected to tighten monetary policy to manage inflation or economic overheating. This suggests a stance that is more inclined towards tightening rather than easing, aligning with a hawkish monetary policy approach."
2,Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the extraction of equity through amortization, which is a normal financial process that does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate concern for inflation nor employment levels that would prompt a tightening or easing of policy. The focus on the mechanics of equity extraction from home prices does not provide clear insights into the FOMC's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools."
2,"That apparently has not made its way into prices yet,","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""That apparently has not made its way into prices yet,"" suggests that some factor (not specified in the sentence) has not yet had an impact on inflation. This statement does not clearly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it simply observes a current condition without providing a policy direction. It reflects a wait-and-see approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes projections for unemployment and inflation that align with the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) median projections, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests an expectation of improvement in labor force participation and employment, as well as a projection for inflation that is consistent with the Committee's goals. The statement does not explicitly suggest any imminent policy actions to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation, thus it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic observation regarding the current account deficit and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It explains the cause of the growing deficit as a result of increased investment and productivity in the U.S., along with capital inflows attracted by higher rates of return. This statement does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on economic conditions."
1,"Furthermore, policymakers hoped that additional tools at their disposal--so-called incomes policies enforced by “jawboning,” guideposts, and price and wage controls--were ready to combat and control any resulting upcreep in inflation with minimal macroeconomic cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that policymakers are prepared to use additional tools to combat and control inflation, which suggests a stance towards tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key goals. The mention of ""incomes policies,"" ""jawboning,"" guideposts, and price and wage controls as measures to address inflation implies a proactive approach to preventing an increase in inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,Higher productivity is unambiguously good.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Higher productivity is unambiguously good"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it is a general statement affirming the positive nature of increased productivity. Higher productivity can lead to economic growth without necessarily causing inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not provide specific guidance on the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as interest rate changes, to achieve these goals."
1,"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern that inflation is significantly above the target level, and it emphasizes the importance of returning to the target to achieve the FOMC's mandated goals. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to reduce inflation, which is consistent with a hawkish approach. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to cool down the economy and bring inflation back to the desired level."
2,"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the perception of congressional momentum and support for inflation targeting, which is more about political will or the lack thereof rather than a clear monetary policy direction. It suggests an absence of strong opinions, which aligns with a neutral stance, as it neither advocates for action (hawkish) nor suggests a need for easing (dovish)."
1,"These forecasts and forward guidance had a significant effect on raising market interest rates, even though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in December 2021.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the effect of forecasts and forward guidance on market interest rates without indicating a change in the primary policy tool, the federal funds rate. It suggests that communication alone influenced market conditions, but does not explicitly state a policy action towards tightening or easing. The sentence reflects the FOMC's transparency about its influence on expectations but does not commit to a specific direction of monetary policy."
0,"While I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to see a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on seeing actual, sustained improvement in inflation before meeting the average inflation goal, which suggests a commitment to not easing monetary policy until inflation is under control. This stance is consistent with a tightening bias, as the FOMC would likely maintain or increase interest rates to ensure inflation moves towards the target, aligning with a hawkish monetary policy approach."
2,"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy adjustments, such as tightening or easing. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of the challenges faced by monetary policymakers in emerging economies, which does not directly indicate a stance on the FOMC's monetary policy in the United States. It is a general statement about the global economic environment rather than a comment on the FOMC's policy intentions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates."
0,"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic transition from recovery to expansion, reflecting on the past performance of the U.S. economy without directly indicating a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It provides context on the state of the economy but does not suggest any specific monetary policy actions."
0,"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a recognition of the risks associated with very low (zero or negative) inflation rates, which could suggest a bias towards preventing such an outcome by potentially tightening monetary policy to keep inflation within the target range. This stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices with a 2% inflation target, and the acknowledgment of these risks indicates a preference for avoiding deflationary scenarios that could warrant a more hawkish approach."
2,"From a policy perspective, a difficulty with all these measures is that they reflect expectations of headline inflation rather than the core inflation measures usually emphasized in the monetary policy context.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in using different measures of inflation for policy decisions, highlighting the difference between headline inflation and core inflation, which is typically used in the context of monetary policy. It does not directly suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points out a technical consideration in policy formulation. This reflects a balanced view on how inflation expectations should be interpreted within the framework of monetary policy without indicating a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the general understanding of the time lags associated with the impact of monetary policy on the real economy versus financial markets. It does not indicate a specific direction of policy change (tightening or easing) but rather explains the temporal effects of policy actions. This understanding is crucial for the FOMC as it considers the timing of its decisions in pursuit of its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Operating Strategies and the FOMC Meeting Now that we appreciate the challenging nature of monetary policy, we are ready to develop a strategy for implementing open market operations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on the process of developing a strategy for implementing open market operations, which is a tool used by the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the preparation and planning aspect of monetary policy execution. The sentence reflects an understanding of the complexities involved in monetary policy and the need for a strategic approach, without revealing a bias towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Expectations of price increases over the near-term--specifically, over the next year--have, in fact, risen noticeably on the heels of the actual increase in inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is an observed rise in both the expectations of price increases in the near term and the actual inflation. This suggests that there could be a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract the rising inflation and align with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to increased inflation expectations is typically considered a hawkish stance."
0,The dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the structural rate of productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth rather than a direct indication of a change in monetary policy stance. An increase in the structural rate of productivity growth can have implications for both inflation and employment, but the sentence does not explicitly suggest an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an economic condition that could potentially allow for more robust growth without leading to inflation, which might not necessitate a policy adjustment in either direction immediately."
1,The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that strong investment is contributing to the growth of productive capacity, which in turn helps to contain inflationary pressures. This implies that the economy is performing well with controlled inflation, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating. The focus on preventing inflation aligns with a hawkish stance, as it indicates vigilance against rising inflation and may lead to actions that would typically involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down economic expansion."
2,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is placing a high priority on monitoring inflation developments, which suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation is perceived to be deviating from their target. This focus on inflation, especially in the medium term, implies a concern for price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC. A hawkish stance is often associated with preventing or curbing higher inflation through measures such as raising interest rates."
2,This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a focus on price stability, which is often associated with a restrictive monetary policy stance. This implies a readiness to counteract cyclical increases in demand, which could lead to inflationary pressures. By emphasizing price stability, the FOMC may be signaling a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical periods to draw lessons for current monetary policy management, without indicating a specific direction for policy tightening or easing. It suggests a consideration of past experiences to inform present decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to addressing risks and uncertainties. The sentence does not provide enough context to determine whether the lessons learned advocate for a more hawkish or dovish stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"Central bank actions are designed in the first instance to influence asset prices and yields, which in turn affect economic decisions and thus the evolution of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the mechanism by which central bank actions, such as those by the Federal Reserve, influence the economy. It does not explicitly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is currently aiming to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides a general statement on how monetary policy operates by affecting asset prices and yields, which then impact economic decisions and the broader economy. This reflects an understanding of the FOMC's principles and the transmission of monetary policy but does not signal a specific policy stance."
1,"Spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concern about the potential risks and imbalances in the financial system, such as very low spreads on risky private-sector debt and excessive leverage in the housing market, which could lead to financial instability. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to address these issues, in line with its goal of maintaining stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Tightening monetary policy could help mitigate the risk of asset bubbles and financial imbalances, which is a hawkish stance."
0,Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a commentary on the perception of the FOMC's focus, rather than a direct statement about its policy stance. It does not indicate a clear intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather emphasizes the dual mandate of the FOMC to balance both inflation and employment objectives."
0,too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests a viewpoint on the state of employment but does not directly relate to actions the FOMC might take. It could be interpreted as a critique of forecasts or expectations rather than a policy stance. Without additional context indicating a policy shift, the sentence is best classified as neutral."
0,"Moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the Great Depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.","DOVISH

The sentence reflects a dovish stance because it indicates a concern for inflation rates being too low, which could lead to deflationary pressures that are generally combated with easier monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and prevent disruption to employment. The FOMC's mention of unwelcome further declines in inflation suggests a readiness to take action to prevent deflation and support the economy, aligning with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,Funding of our current account deficit likely will become more difficult when home bias approaches its practical minimum.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies concerns about the challenges in funding the current account deficit as the ability to attract foreign investment due to home bias (preference for domestic over foreign investment) diminishes. This could suggest a need for higher interest rates to attract foreign capital, indicating a tightening of monetary policy, which is considered hawkish. Tighter monetary policy could be used to address imbalances such as a current account deficit by making domestic assets more attractive to foreign investors."
1,Such a jump could raise core inflation temporarily if it is passed through to other prices or if it contributes to increasing inflation expectations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests concern about a potential increase in core inflation, either through a pass-through effect to other prices or by influencing inflation expectations to rise. This indicates a focus on the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could imply a readiness to tighten monetary policy to prevent an inflationary spike, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy is a common response to rising inflation or inflation expectations to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes different modeling approaches to economic factors, some of which are directly linked to observable variables like inflation, while others are more abstract statistical representations. It does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy but rather discusses the methodology for understanding economic conditions. This is a technical statement about economic modeling rather than a policy stance."
2,"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general principle regarding the relationship between long-term interest rates and a stable macroeconomic environment, which aligns with the FOMC's broader goals of maximum employment and stable prices. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the context in which the dual mandate operates."
0,"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical statement reflecting on past achievements of the Federal Reserve in terms of inflation management. It does not directly indicate a current policy stance or future policy actions regarding tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the historical performance of the Federal Reserve in achieving one of its long-term goals, which is maintaining stable inflation around the 2 percent target."
2,"But even this relation--between the unemployment rate and the concept of economic slack--is not necessarily constant, and thus a given unemployment rate may not indicate the same level of slack at two separate times.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the variability in the relationship between the unemployment rate and economic slack, suggesting that the same unemployment rate can indicate different levels of economic slack at different times. This reflects an understanding of the complexity of economic indicators and does not directly suggest a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a statement of fact about economic conditions rather than a policy direction, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"My goal is not to draw conclusions on recent movements in risk premiums but rather to give you a sense of how estimates of risk premiums may influence our policy decisionmaking, to note some of the difficulties that we face in interpreting their movements, and, I hope, to stimulate further research in this already fertile field.1 At the Federal Reserve, we pay a lot of attention to financial market prices in the formulation of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an approach to policy decision-making that considers estimates of risk premiums and acknowledges the complexities in interpreting financial market movements. The focus on stimulating further research and the attention to financial market prices suggest a balanced and informed approach to policy formulation, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
2,"The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad-woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the comparability of commodity prices over time and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy actions related to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,"Although your papers concentrate on the equity premium, I would like to take a few minutes today to broaden the discussion to encompass risk premiums in other markets and to highlight the connections between risk premiums and monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a broader discussion on the relationship between risk premiums in various markets and monetary policy, which is an analytical perspective rather than a policy direction."
1,"Inflation-targeting regimes may allow some consideration of real-side costs either by specifying relatively long adjustment periods, to allow a high probability that the central bank can bring inflation down to the target within the allotted time, or by including ""escape clauses"" that grant temporary exemptions for large supply shocks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the flexibility that inflation-targeting regimes may have in achieving their goals, allowing for longer adjustment periods or escape clauses for supply shocks. It does not directly indicate a current stance of tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains a feature of the policy framework that can accommodate various economic conditions. This reflects a balanced approach to managing inflation while considering the real-side costs and potential disturbances, aligning with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates without specifying a current policy direction."
2,"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence compares the recent performance of inflation and unemployment with that of the 1970s, without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather reflects on historical economic conditions. The statement is more of an observation than a policy stance, and it does not provide clear guidance on future actions to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the timing of productivity benefits from investments in new technologies, which is more of an economic observation than a direct indication of monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on understanding the lag between technology investments and realized productivity gains, which could eventually influence policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction in policy."
1,"During the past several years, workers across the wage distribution--not just at the upper end--have seen noticeable increases in the inflation-adjusted value of their wages.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that workers across various wage levels have experienced real wage growth, which could suggest broad-based wage pressures that might contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, if inflation is a concern, this could signal a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, hence the hawkish stance."
2,"In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical fact about technological innovation and its impact on productivity, specifically the spread of electrification to the factory floor following World War I. It does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates that could be used to infer the FOMC's current policy stance. Therefore, it is classified as neutral with respect to monetary policy."
2,"With regard to our price-stability mandate,","NEUTRAL

The provided sentence, ""With regard to our price-stability mandate,"" does not contain enough information to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It merely introduces a topic related to one of the FOMC's goals, which is price stability. Without additional context on how the FOMC plans to achieve or maintain price stability, whether through tightening, easing, or maintaining the current policy, it is not possible to classify the stance as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the classification is neutral."
2,How would that development affect the economy and monetary policy?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""How would that development affect the economy and monetary policy?"" is asking a question rather than providing a statement or indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not give any specific information about whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it suggests a consideration of the potential impacts of an unspecified development on the economy and the monetary policy, which is a neutral inquiry."
2,"Despite some recent turbulence, owing in part to geopolitical events, stock prices have logged robust gains over the past 3-1/2 years, and broad equity indices have now retraced most of the ground lost between 2000 and 2002.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical observation of stock market performance without directly indicating a future course of action regarding monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather provides context on market conditions, which is part of the overall economic assessment the FOMC considers when making policy decisions."
2,"Besides influencing the near-term course of important economic variables, such as gross domestic product growth, inflation, and profits, productivity largely determines our society's long-term economic welfare.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of productivity in influencing key economic variables and the long-term economic welfare of society. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides a general statement about the importance of productivity in the economy, which is a factor considered by the FOMC but does not in itself suggest a specific policy action."
0,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It acknowledges a positive economic development (solid productivity growth) that could support both price stability and maximum employment in the long term. However, it does not explicitly indicate whether this will lead to tightening or easing of monetary policy, thus the stance is neutral. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions rather than a clear direction for future policy actions."
1,This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities--and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about potential inflation due to monetary expansion, suggesting that if this expansion is not counteracted by selling securities (sterilization), inflation could rise. The mention of the difficulty in continuing sterilization due to the scale of debt indicates a risk of not being able to tighten monetary policy as needed, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation."
2,will soon fall well below its underlying trend as the price of energy falls back to its initial level.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that inflation pressures are expected to ease due to a decrease in energy prices, which suggests that there may be less need for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with maintaining or lowering interest rates to support economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"This effort culminated in 1943 with the publication of Banking and Monetary Statistics, which included annual figures on demand and time deposits from 1892 and on currency from 1860.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context about the publication of banking and monetary statistics and does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of policy but rather reflects on a past effort to compile economic data."
0,"Nonetheless, employment is still 9.5 million below its pre-pandemic level for the economy as a whole.","DOVISH

The sentence highlights a significant shortfall in employment relative to pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the economy is not operating at full capacity. This could imply that the FOMC might favor an easing of monetary policy to stimulate job growth and move closer to its maximum employment goal, consistent with a dovish stance."
0,The second requirement contributes to the first and also to smoothing fluctuations in output around full employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes how one policy goal supports another and aims to stabilize economic output, which is a statement of policy strategy rather than a direct indication of a move to tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects a balanced approach to achieving full employment and managing output fluctuations, without a clear bias towards either a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Shortly after 9 a.m. each morning, the Desk staff and staff members at the Board of Governors confer over the phone to discuss their respective estimates of the day's demand for balances as well as to consider factors that may affect supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine operational procedure regarding the daily assessment of demand and supply for balances by the Desk staff and the Board of Governors. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is simply a statement of process and does not reflect a policy direction."
2,"There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates, compared to previous expansions","HAWKISH

The sentence points out an ""unusual discrepancy"" between low unemployment and capacity utilization rates compared to previous economic expansions. This could imply that the economy is operating beyond its potential, which might lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this observation could justify a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Such departures of expectations from perfect rationality can be an important source of observed inflation dynamics.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges the complexity of inflation dynamics and the role that expectations and potential deviations from rational behavior can play in influencing inflation. This reflects an understanding of the economic environment and the factors that contribute to inflation, without suggesting a specific policy action."
1,Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a strategy focused on actively reducing inflation, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising. Describing the economy as being ""one recession from price stability"" indicates a willingness to accept the economic slowdown (often associated with recessions) as a means to achieve price stability, which is consistent with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating growth."
1,"Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic recovery without explicitly indicating a future direction for monetary policy. It acknowledges a rapid improvement in employment and activity, which could be seen as a positive outcome aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, without additional context on how this rebound affects the Committee's outlook on inflation or employment shortfalls, it does not clearly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy."
