0,"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the speaker is comfortable with a tight labor market despite inflation being below the 2% target, implying that there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance leans towards supporting employment, even at the risk of lower inflation, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
1,"Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Well, you’re certainly right that we have been over-optimistic about out-year growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It is an acknowledgment of a forecasting error regarding economic growth expectations. This statement does not provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral comment on past projections and does not suggest a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments."
2,The unemployment rate was 3.5 percent in February and has been at or near half-century lows for almost two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the current unemployment rate and its historical context, without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. The low unemployment rate aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, but the sentence does not provide information on how the Committee might act in response to this data."
2,"So you’re right, you’re seeing—I, I can’t remember the number, but it might be in the 3s—3, 3½ percent growth for next year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence appears to be a factual statement about economic growth expectations rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of growth in the 3 to 3.5 percent range could be seen as positive, but without additional context on inflation and employment, it does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"Again, that’s not a forecast, I’ve made a hypothesis, which would imply slower improvement in unemployment.","DOVISH

The sentence implies an expectation of a slower improvement in unemployment, which suggests that the economy might not be overheating and therefore there may be less need for tightening monetary policy. A dovish stance typically supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity and improve employment."
1,And we’d like to see that in the form of a series of declining monthly inflation readings—that’s what we’re looking for.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a focus on reducing inflation, suggesting that the FOMC is looking for a consistent decrease in inflation rates. This implies a stance towards tightening monetary policy to achieve the goal of price stability, which aligns with a hawkish approach to counteract higher inflation."
2,"When, when you get to—in, in the forecast, all of that, you know, supply and demand sides of the economy adapt.","NEUTRAL

The sentence seems to reflect a general statement about the economic process rather than a specific policy stance. It suggests that over time, both supply and demand in the economy will adjust, which is a neutral observation and does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It acknowledges the dynamic nature of the economy without providing a clear direction on the future of monetary policy actions."
2,Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Wage inflation has been running at 2 percent"" does not explicitly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy. It simply states a fact about the current rate of wage inflation, which is aligned with the FOMC's long-term inflation target of 2 percent. This suggests that the current wage inflation rate is neither exerting upward pressure on overall inflation that would warrant a hawkish stance, nor is it so low that it would signal deflationary concerns requiring a dovish response. The statement is balanced and does not imply a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Of course, we’re ready to provide information that Congress needs to evaluate the Fed’s decisionmaking, in monetary policy and elsewhere.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the Federal Reserve's commitment to transparency and accountability in its decision-making process, which is a procedural statement rather than a comment on the direction of monetary policy."
0,"We also said we wouldn’t raise rates just in response to very low unemployment, in the absence of inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a stance towards easing monetary policy, or at least not tightening it, in the context of low unemployment. It suggests that the FOMC would not raise interest rates solely due to low unemployment figures unless there were accompanying signs of inflation. This aligns with a dovish approach, as it implies a tolerance for lower unemployment without preemptive tightening of policy, as long as inflation remains in check. This stance is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment and stable prices, indicating that they prioritize ensuring that employment levels can remain high without the immediate need to counteract this with higher interest rates, unless inflationary pressures emerge."
1,An unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation could tell you that you’re reaching those points.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that if there is an unexpectedly sharp increase in wages or inflation, it could be a sign that the economy is reaching a point where it might overheat, which would typically prompt the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent excessive inflation and maintain stability. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is concerned with controlling inflation and often involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to slow down economic growth."
2,So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that inflation is running below the target level, which could suggest that there is room for a more accommodative monetary policy stance to stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the FOMC's 2% long-term goal. A ""prolonged shortfall of inflation"" indicates that the FOMC may consider easing policies to address the lower-than-desired inflation."
2,"And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about asset prices potentially having a positive contribution to the economy, which could be related to overall economic conditions rather than a specific monetary policy action. The statement is more descriptive of market dynamics and does not explicitly suggest a move towards either higher or lower interest rates or other monetary policy adjustments."
0,"So, there has been impact through lower interest rates, but I think more broadly is the indirect effects.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges the impact of lower interest rates, which could be a result of previous dovish policy actions, but it also mentions ""indirect effects"" without specifying what those are or how they might influence future policy decisions. The statement seems to be an observation of the current situation rather than a signal of future policy moves, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"And what it is is, it’s an expression of the thinking about individual Committee members about appropriate monetary policy and the path of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members' individual thoughts on suitable monetary policy and economic trajectory. It does not indicate a specific direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a general statement about the process of policy formulation. The sentence emphasizes the diversity of opinions within the Committee and the deliberative nature of their policy decisions, without revealing a clear stance on the future of monetary policy."
1,And productivity’s been very low.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And productivity’s been very low"" does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a statement of economic condition regarding productivity levels. Low productivity could have implications for both inflation and employment, but without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to this condition, the stance remains neutral. It does not inherently suggest an immediate need for a policy adjustment in either direction."
2,"Wage growth is not—there are many factors that affect it—it’s not definitive in any sense in determining our policy, but it does have a bearing on the inflation outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while wage growth is a factor considered in shaping the inflation outlook, it is not the sole determinant of the FOMC's policy decisions. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the complexity of economic indicators without committing to a specific direction of policy adjustment (tightening or easing). The statement reflects an understanding that multiple factors influence inflation and employment, and the FOMC's policy stance will depend on a comprehensive assessment of all available data."
0,"We’re not seeing evidence in labor markets of very substantial upward pressures on labor that could signify extreme shortages of labor that could propel inflation higher in a very rapid way, and inflation is still operating below our objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are no significant labor market pressures that could lead to rapidly increasing inflation, and it also notes that inflation is currently below the FOMC's 2% objective. This suggests that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy, as the conditions described do not pose an immediate threat to the inflation target. Instead, the statement implies that there may be room for a more accommodative stance to support the labor market and help inflation rise to the desired level."
0,"You know, it says that we will seek to—seek inflation that runs moderately above 2 percent for some time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an intention to allow inflation to run moderately above the 2 percent target for some time. This suggests a willingness to tolerate higher inflation temporarily, which is often associated with a less aggressive approach to tightening monetary policy in the short term. However, the commitment to seek inflation above the target implies that the FOMC anticipates the need for future monetary tightening to bring inflation back down to the 2 percent goal over the long term. This forward-looking stance on preventing inflation from becoming entrenched is typically considered hawkish, as it signals a readiness to implement measures to control inflationary pressures."
0,The shock that the—from the pandemic was unprecedented both in its nature and in its size and in the amount of unemployment that it created and in the shock to economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of the pandemic on the economy, noting its unprecedented nature and the resulting unemployment and economic shock. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides context for the economic conditions that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions."
2,"And in so far as that will affect monetary policy, of course we will have to factor those policies along with many other things, including the global environment and oil prices and other matters.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is taking a balanced approach by considering a wide range of factors, including fiscal policies, the global environment, and oil prices, when determining monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather to incorporate various elements into their decision-making process. This reflects a stance of monitoring and reacting to economic indicators as they arise, which is consistent with a neutral policy position."
0,"But in many countries around the Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL world that are important commodity exporters, the decline we’ve seen in oil prices has had a depressing effect on their growth, their trade with us and other trade partners, and caused problems that have had spillovers to the global economy as well.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the impact of lower oil prices on commodity-exporting countries and the subsequent spillover effects on the global economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on external economic conditions that could influence the FOMC's policy decisions. The focus is on the observation of international economic developments rather than a clear direction for domestic monetary policy adjustments."
1,So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So it’s a double whammy coming from higher gasoline prices"" does not directly indicate a clear stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely acknowledges the impact of rising gasoline prices, which could be inflationary (suggesting a hawkish response might be needed) or could slow economic growth (suggesting a dovish response might be needed). However, without additional context on how the FOMC plans to respond to these higher prices, the stance remains unclear or balanced."
2,"I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy—that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the complexity of economic forecasting and acknowledges that tax policy is just one of many factors influencing growth and inflation projections. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to the multifaceted nature of economic analysis that the FOMC must consider when making policy decisions. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish nor dovish."
0,"And it’s natural that if it can be employed that, just as monetary policy is doing a lot to try to June 15, 2016 stimulate growth, that fiscal policy should play a role.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that both monetary and fiscal policies should be used to stimulate growth, suggesting an inclination towards easing monetary policy to support economic expansion. This dovish stance aligns with the FOMC's goal of promoting maximum employment and suggests that additional policy support, possibly through lower interest rates or other accommodative measures, may be appropriate to achieve this objective."
2,"And the maximum level of employment that’s consistent with price stability evolves over time within a—within a business cycle and over a longer period, in part reflecting [the] evolution of the factors that affect labor supply, including those related to the pandemic.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the dynamic nature of the relationship between employment and price stability, acknowledging that the maximum level of employment consistent with price stability changes over time due to various factors, including those related to the pandemic. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the considerations that affect the FOMC's assessment of the labor market in the context of its dual mandate."
2,"We understand that inflation dynamics evolve constantly over time, but they don’t change rapidly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an acknowledgement of the gradual nature of inflation dynamics without suggesting any immediate action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an understanding that inflation trends do not shift quickly, which implies a steady approach to policy without a clear bias towards hawkish (tightening) or dovish (easing) adjustments. The statement is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to monitoring economic indicators over time and adjusting policy as needed to achieve its long-term goals of stable prices and maximum employment."
0,"And inflation is moving—moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is trending upwards towards the FOMC's target of 2 percent. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from overshooting the target, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates or taking other actions to restrain economic activity and keep inflation in check."
1,"I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a recognition of economic progress and an approach to a sustainable unemployment rate, which suggests a balanced view on the current economic situation. It does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the achievement of one aspect of the FOMC's dual mandate—maximum employment. The statement does not provide information on inflation or the stance on future policy adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants in the FOMC have adjusted their views on the appropriate path for policy due to a slower projected path for global growth and some tightening in credit conditions. This suggests a potential shift towards a more restrictive monetary policy stance to counteract the negative impacts on the U.S. economy from a slowdown in global growth and tighter credit conditions, which could threaten the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Tightening credit conditions often lead to higher interest rates, which is a typical tool used in a hawkish policy stance to manage inflation and stabilize the economy."
1,"Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Our mandate, sorry, is price inflation"" seems to emphasize the FOMC's focus on controlling price inflation. This focus on inflation often implies a willingness to tighten monetary policy to keep inflation in check, which is considered a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy can include raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply, which are measures typically taken to address high inflation and align with the goal of stable prices."
0,"Moreover, in light of the anticipated modest pace of economic recovery, the Committee expects that over coming quarters the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward its mandate-consistent levels.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) anticipates a slow economic recovery and a gradual decrease in unemployment rates. This implies that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce measures to stimulate the economy until it sees more robust signs of recovery and a faster improvement in the labor market. The use of the word ""modest"" in describing the pace of economic recovery and the expectation of only a ""gradual"" decline in the unemployment rate indicates a cautious approach, which is typically associated with a dovish stance on monetary policy. This dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's commitment to support maximum employment, one of its key objectives."
2,"On the other hand, by that metric, the, the September 16, 2020 unemployment rate would have been in the—in the 20s in, in April.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is providing a historical comparison of unemployment rates, which by itself does not indicate a clear direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects on past data to assess the state of employment but does not suggest any specific policy action."
2,So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC takes into consideration risks to the financial system that could impede achieving its goals, which include maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not explicitly suggest an imminent change in monetary policy towards tightening or easing but rather reflects a balanced approach to monitoring financial stability as part of their broader mandate. It shows an awareness of potential risks without indicating a specific direction for policy adjustment."
2,It was the year of synchronized global growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""It was the year of synchronized global growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a descriptive statement about the state of the global economy, without any explicit connection to the FOMC's monetary policy actions or intentions. It does not provide information on inflation, employment, or interest rates, which are the key indicators for determining the FOMC's policy stance."
2,"We heard anecdotes today in the meeting about firms that might be government contractors that were, you know, not sure about whether the contracts would still be in place come January and making employment decisions based on that.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes uncertainty among firms regarding government contracts and how this affects their employment decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects the FOMC's consideration of nonmonetary factors that can impact employment, which is one of their key objectives. The sentence does not provide information on inflation or the direction of interest rate adjustments, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"At the time of our FOMC meeting in January, prospects for continued economic growth remained favorable, and we judged that monetary policy was well positioned to support that outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) believes that the current state of monetary policy is appropriate to support favorable economic growth prospects. It does not explicitly suggest an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather conveys a sense of satisfaction with the current policy stance in relation to the economic outlook at that time. This reflects a balanced approach, consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy direction."
0,So unemployment has tended to go up much faster for minorities and for others who are—tend to be at the low end of the income spectrum.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation about the distributional effects of unemployment, noting that minorities and low-income individuals tend to experience higher rates of unemployment. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment and acknowledges the varying impact of economic conditions on different demographic groups. It does not provide specific guidance on future policy actions but rather highlights an area of concern that the FOMC might consider when making decisions to fulfill its mandate."
2,"For example, we have used some of our work to look at interest rate risk and interest rate sensitivity and, you know, found generally that banks can also sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates as well for a number of reasons, one of them being that higher interest rates increase their franchise value because it increases their net interest margin over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that banks can sustain a significant increase in long-term interest rates, which implies that the FOMC sees room for raising interest rates without causing undue harm to the banking sector. This is indicative of a tightening monetary policy stance, as higher interest rates are typically used to control inflation and stabilize the economy. The mention of increased net interest margin for banks in the context of higher rates also aligns with a hawkish view, as it implies that the financial sector could benefit from, and thus potentially support, a policy of higher interest rates."
2,"But that has not—what, what happens is that when wages move up because unemployment is low, companies have been absorbing that increase into their margins rather than raising prices.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that despite low unemployment leading to higher wages, companies are not passing these costs on to consumers through higher prices, which suggests that inflationary pressures are not intensifying. This could indicate that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or easing current policy to encourage employment and economic growth."
0,"Well, if the economy worsens and inflation remains relatively low, then we wouldn’t begin to exit, and, therefore, we wouldn’t change the language.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that if the economy deteriorates and inflation stays low, the FOMC would not proceed with exiting its accommodative monetary policy stance, nor would it alter its communication to suggest a tightening of policy. This indicates a readiness to maintain or even enhance monetary easing to support the economy, aligning with a dovish stance that prioritizes economic growth and employment over immediate concerns about inflation."
2,"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It merely states an observation about the current state of unemployment and social issues, without suggesting any particular monetary policy action or direction. It does not provide information on inflation or the federal funds rate, which are key indicators of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
2,"Everyone, particularly people on fixed incomes, and at the lower part of the income distribution are better off with stable prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the benefits of stable prices for all, particularly for those on fixed incomes and at the lower part of the income distribution. It reflects one of the FOMC's key objectives—stable prices—but does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it underscores the importance of price stability as a goal, which is a fundamental aspect of the FOMC's mandate."
1,"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes observations in the commercial real estate market, noting both high valuations and a tightening of lending standards, which is associated with less debt growth. This statement does not directly indicate a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of current market conditions. The mention of tightening lending standards could be seen as a precautionary measure against potential market overheating, which is a neutral action in the context of balancing risk and financial stability."
1,"Inflation has moved up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation has been rising recently, primarily due to higher prices for commodities and imported goods. This observation suggests that there may be upward pressure on overall price levels, which could warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and align with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Rising inflation is typically met with a hawkish response to prevent it from becoming entrenched."
1,The American economy is very strong and well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the American economy is robust enough to withstand the effects of a tighter monetary policy, which typically means increasing interest rates to control inflation. This implies a readiness to implement measures that would slow down economic activity to maintain price stability, aligning with a hawkish stance."
1,And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""And so you’re seeing prices are moving back up off their lows there"" does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for monetary policy. It simply states an observation that prices are rising from their lowest points, which could be part of the normal economic fluctuations. Without additional context on the speed of the price increases, their impact on inflation, or how this relates to the FOMC's targets, it's not possible to determine if this would lead to a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Therefore, the stance is classified as NEUTRAL."
2,So negative interest rates is something that we looked at during the financial crisis and chose not to do.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical perspective on policy decisions rather than indicating a current policy stance toward tightening or easing. It simply states that negative interest rates were considered in the past and ultimately not implemented, without suggesting a future direction for monetary policy."
0,Long-term unemployment in the current economy is—is the worst—really the worst it’s been in the postwar period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a condition of the economy, specifically the state of long-term unemployment, without directly suggesting an immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It acknowledges a significant economic challenge but does not in itself indicate a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might consider such information in the context of its broader goals, including maximum employment, but the sentence alone does not advocate for a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer—are not exhausted, there are still other things that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that even when traditional monetary policy tools, like adjusting short-term interest rates, are no longer available (e.g., when rates hit the lower bound of zero), the central bank still has other measures it can take to provide economic stimulus. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further if necessary, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment, even in the face of conventional tools being maxed out."
1,"In spite of having such slow growth, disappointing productivity growth, we have a labor market that last year generated an average of about 230,000 jobs a month and so far this year has been generating about 180,000 jobs a month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where, despite slow overall economic growth and disappointing productivity, the labor market is still generating a significant number of jobs each month. This indicates that the labor market is performing relatively well in terms of employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals. However, the sentence does not explicitly suggest a need to either tighten or ease monetary policy, as it presents a mixed view: slow growth (which could suggest a dovish stance) alongside strong job creation (which could be seen as an argument against the need for an easing policy). Therefore, the stance is neutral, as it does not clearly lean towards a policy adjustment in either direction."
1,The Federal Reserve is fully committed to both sides of its mandate—to price stability as well as to maximum employment—and it has both the tools and the will to act at the appropriate time to avoid any emerging threat to price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a strong commitment to maintaining price stability, which is often associated with a willingness to tighten monetary policy if there is a perceived threat of inflation. The mention of having both the tools and the will to act suggests that the Federal Reserve is prepared to increase interest rates or take other contractionary measures to prevent inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,"And, as I went into detail in Jackson Hole and won’t repeat all of that there, there are other ways in which we see underutilization—high levels that have come down only very marginally of part-time employment for economic—or involuntary part-time employment, perhaps some remaining shortfall of labor force participation as a result of cyclical factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there is still underutilization in the labor market, with high levels of involuntary part-time employment and a potential shortfall in labor force participation due to cyclical factors. This suggests that the economy has not yet reached maximum employment, one of the FOMC's goals. The dovish stance implies that there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative to support further improvements in employment without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
2,"So, we are taking account of international developments, including prospects for growth in our trade partners, in making the forecast we have here.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is considering international developments and the growth prospects of trade partners as part of their economic forecast, which suggests a comprehensive approach to policy-making. It does not explicitly signal an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather shows attentiveness to a broad set of economic indicators, which is consistent with a balanced and data-driven approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,We also do see the different measures of slack in the labor market point to different assessments of just what maximum employment is.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about the varying indicators of labor market slack and the complexity in assessing the state of maximum employment. This suggests a balanced approach, as the FOMC is considering different data points to understand the labor market conditions without signaling a clear move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"But, really, it isn’t monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""But, really, it isn’t monetary policy."" does not provide any indication of a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the subject being discussed is not related to monetary policy actions, such as adjustments to the federal funds rate, which are used to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, without additional context, the sentence is considered neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
1,"In other cases, it’s pretty clear that inflation has spread more broadly across services.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is becoming more widespread across services, which suggests rising inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to counteract inflation and achieve the target rate of 2% over the long term. A hawkish stance typically involves raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and prevent inflation from escalating."
1,"The Federal Reserve’s response is guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices for the American people, along with our responsibilities to promote the stability of the financial system.","NEUTRAL

The sentence outlines the Federal Reserve's broad mandates without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It emphasizes the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, as well as financial stability, but does not provide information on whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is a general affirmation of the Fed's responsibilities and does not hint at any imminent policy actions."
1,"In any case, we, our job is to deliver price stability, and I think—you can think of price stability as an asset that just delivers large benefits to society over a long period of time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the FOMC's commitment to delivering price stability, which is often associated with controlling inflation. By highlighting price stability as a significant asset, it suggests that the FOMC prioritizes this goal, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to ensure inflation rates are kept in check, especially if current or anticipated conditions threaten to elevate inflation above the targeted level. This stance aligns with a hawkish view, where the focus is on preventing high inflation even if it means potentially slowing down economic growth or increasing unemployment in the short term."
1,"As I mentioned, monetary policy operates with lags, so, the policies we have in place, we think, will gradually—only gradually—move inflation back to 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the current monetary policy is expected to slowly steer inflation back to the target level of 2 percent, suggesting a cautious approach that does not involve aggressive tightening of monetary policy. This indicates a stance towards easing or at least not actively tightening policy, which is consistent with a dovish outlook."
0,"And as I mentioned earlier, the unemployment decline last month was more than 100 percent accounted for by declines in participation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the decline in unemployment was not due to job creation but rather a decrease in the labor force participation rate. This suggests that the labor market may not be as tight as the unemployment rate alone would imply, which could mean there is less upward pressure on wages and inflation. Therefore, there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to cool down the economy."
1,"The jobs picture continues to be strong, with the unemployment rate near historic lows and with stronger wage gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a robust labor market, characterized by low unemployment and rising wages. This scenario could lead to inflationary pressures, which the Federal Reserve might counteract with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. Hence, the statement leans toward a hawkish stance, suggesting vigilance against potential inflation and possibly preparing for interest rate hikes to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates."" does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It merely indicates that the speaker is about to address a topic related to exchange rates, without offering any insight into whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current monetary policy. Therefore, it is classified as neutral."
