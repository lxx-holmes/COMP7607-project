2,"In the circumstances, most members endorsed a proposal to delete as no longer necessary the previous summary statement relating to the risks to growth and inflation taken together.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to remove a previous statement about risks to growth and inflation, suggesting that they no longer see those risks as pressing or relevant. This does not directly imply an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reflects an assessment that the previous outlook has changed. The removal of the statement could be seen as a sign that the FOMC believes the risks have become more balanced or have diminished, which does not clearly signal a hawkish or dovish stance."
0,"In their discussion of considerations related to asset purchases, various participants noted that these purchases were an important part of the monetary policy toolkit and a critical aspect of the Federal Reserve's response to the economic effects of the pandemic, supporting smooth financial market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, which aided the flow of credit to households and businesses and supported the recovery.","DOVISH

The sentence describes the use of asset purchases as a critical response to the economic effects of the pandemic, emphasizing their role in supporting financial market functioning, providing accommodative financial conditions, and aiding credit flow to households and businesses, which are all measures that are consistent with a dovish stance aimed at stimulating the economy. This suggests an easing of monetary policy to support the recovery, which aligns with a dovish approach."
2,"Share prices of financial firms fell especially sharply, reportedly a reflection, in part, of concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profits.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions to economic conditions, specifically regarding the financial sector's stock prices and concerns about subprime mortgage exposures and potential slowdowns in merger activity. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic factors that the FOMC might consider in their decision-making process."
2,Participants commented on the continued improvement in labor market conditions in recent months driven by strong demand for workers.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that labor market conditions have been improving due to strong demand for workers, which could suggest a tightening labor market. This improvement could lead to upward pressure on wages and potentially inflation, which might require a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check and maintain the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a hawkish stance, where the FOMC might consider raising interest rates or taking other measures to prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"Looking ahead, however, members reiterated earlier concerns that aggregate demand could continue to grow faster than potential aggregate supply, even under optimistic assumptions regarding future productivity gains.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about aggregate demand growing faster than potential aggregate supply, which could lead to inflationary pressures. This concern suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to curb inflation and maintain stable prices, one of the key goals of the FOMC. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or other measures to slow down economic growth to a sustainable level."
2,"That sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several Federal Reserve officials and the release of the August employment report, which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its ""soft patch. ""","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is recovering from a period of weakness, as indicated by Federal Reserve officials' comments and the August employment report. This perception of economic improvement could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent potential inflationary pressures that might arise from a strengthening economy, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The use of the term ""soft patch"" implies that the period of weaker economic performance is ending, which could reduce the need for a dovish stance that supports economic activity. Instead, it may signal a shift towards a more hawkish approach to ensure price stability as the economy gains momentum."
0,Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while market-based measures of inflation expectations have decreased, the survey-based measures of long-term inflation expectations have not changed. This mixed signal suggests that the FOMC is observing both a potential decrease in inflation pressures (as indicated by market-based measures) and stability in the long-term outlook (as indicated by survey-based measures). The statement does not clearly lean towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather reflects a balanced view on inflation expectations, which is consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee expects to provide policy accommodation, which typically means easing monetary policy to support economic expansion and improve labor market conditions. This aligns with a dovish stance, as it suggests measures to stimulate the economy rather than tighten it, in order to move closer to achieving the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,Members expected to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until those outcomes were achieved.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members plan to keep monetary policy accommodative until their goals of maximum employment and stable prices are met. An accommodative monetary policy typically involves lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing rather than tightening. This approach is aimed at fostering conditions that can help achieve the FOMC's objectives of full employment and inflation around the 2% target."
1,"In the Committee's discussion of possible adjustments to policy during the intermeeting period, members agreed that the retention of an asymmetric directive toward tightening was consistent with their view that the risks remained biased toward higher inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members agreed to maintain a policy directive that leans towards tightening, which is usually associated with increasing interest rates or reducing monetary supply to control inflation. The mention of risks being ""biased toward higher inflation"" suggests that the Committee is more concerned about inflation rising above their target, which aligns with a hawkish stance focused on preventing or curbing high inflation."
2,"While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a mixed situation where bank lending, which could be a sign of a tightening financial environment, is contracting, yet financial market conditions are still favorable for economic growth. This suggests a balance between concerns over a potential slowdown in economic activity due to reduced lending and optimism due to supportive market conditions. It does not clearly signal a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather an observation of the current state of different financial indicators."
1,"At longer maturities, yields drifted lower over most of the intermeeting period in response to incoming data that suggested economic growth would remain moderate and inflation subdued, but they rebounded late in the period in response to the release of firmer economic data and growing concerns regarding the sustainability of current domestic asset prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market reactions to economic data and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It mentions that yields were lower due to data suggesting moderate economic growth and subdued inflation, which could be interpreted as dovish signals. However, the rebound in yields due to firmer economic data and concerns about asset prices could be seen as hawkish signals. Since the sentence includes both dovish and hawkish elements, the overall stance is neutral, reflecting a balanced view of the economic situation without a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"Market-based measures of inflation compensation remained low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations were little changed, on balance, in recent months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that market-based measures of inflation compensation are low and that survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have not changed significantly. This suggests that inflation expectations are stable, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening nor easing of monetary policy. The FOMC might view this as a sign that current policy is appropriately aligned with their inflation goals, hence the classification as NEUTRAL."
0,"They remarked that a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices were factors likely to put downward pressure on inflation in the period ahead and observed that this meant that the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective would likely be further delayed.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflationary pressures are expected to decrease due to a stronger dollar, weaker demand, and lower oil prices. This suggests that the FOMC might not need to tighten monetary policy as urgently because the factors mentioned are likely to slow down the return of inflation to the Committee's 2 percent target. In a dovish stance, the central bank is less likely to raise interest rates and more likely to maintain or introduce measures to stimulate the economy."
0,"They noted that economic activity and employment had continued to recover but remained well below their levels at the beginning of the year, and that weaker demand and earlier declines in oil prices had been holding down consumer price inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity and employment levels are still recovering and have not reached the levels seen at the beginning of the year. Additionally, it mentions that weaker demand and lower oil prices are contributing to subdued consumer price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure on prices, and therefore, there may be more room for monetary policy to remain accommodative or even ease further to support the economy and boost employment, without the risk of triggering high inflation. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with policies that support economic growth and employment, even at the risk of higher inflation."
1,"At the same time, business firms generally were not raising their prices sufficiently to compensate for faster increases in their labor costs, to the extent that the latter were occurring, evidently because of the persistence of intense competition in most markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that businesses are not increasing prices despite rising labor costs, largely due to strong competition. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not significant enough to warrant a tightening of monetary policy. The lack of price increases to offset higher labor costs implies that the FOMC may not need to raise interest rates to curb inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
0,"In the household sector, mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s, reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically within the household sector, noting that mortgage debt has increased at a slow pace due to decelerating house prices. This statement does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on current economic trends. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to monitoring a range of indicators, but it does not suggest a clear action towards achieving its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,The civilian unemployment rate was 4.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The civilian unemployment rate was 4."" does not provide enough context or information to determine a clear monetary policy stance. It simply states a fact about the unemployment rate without indicating whether the rate is higher or lower than desired, or how the FOMC might respond to it. The FOMC's goals include maximum employment, but without additional context on whether this rate meets their target or how they plan to respond, the stance cannot be classified as hawkish or dovish."
0,"However, other participants noted that the continued subdued trend in wages was evidence of an absence of upward pressure on inflation from the current level of resource utilization.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is no significant wage-induced inflation pressure, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy. Since the FOMC targets a 2% inflation rate over the long term, the absence of upward pressure on inflation from wages indicates that the current monetary policy stance may not need to be adjusted to counteract inflation. This could be interpreted as a dovish stance, as it implies that there may be room for maintaining or easing the current policy to support employment without risking the goal of stable prices."
2,"Much of the current spending for equipment and software reportedly represented replacement demand largely associated with the short useful lives of various types of equipment, and there appeared to be little spending that would entail capital deepening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of current spending on equipment and software, attributing it mainly to replacement demand rather than investment for expansion (capital deepening). This observation does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of business investment behavior. It suggests a status quo in business investment, which does not clearly signal a need for a change in monetary policy stance to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"The staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around, or perhaps a little below, the growth of the economy's estimated potential.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expectation that economic expansion will slow down to align with the economy's estimated potential growth rate. This indicates neither a clear intent to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather suggests a wait-and-see approach as the economy naturally transitions to a sustainable growth rate. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a shift in policy stance."
0,"A surge in nonfarm business inventory investment accounted for a substantial portion of the acceleration in output in the first quarter, and an anticipated moderation in the accumulation of inventories was an important element in forecasts of greatly reduced economic growth in the current quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factor contributing to economic growth in the past quarter and anticipates a change in that factor which is expected to lead to slower growth in the current quarter. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on inventory investment and its impact on economic growth is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest a move towards either more hawkish or dovish policy actions."
2,"Incoming data suggested that, after a weak start to the year, foreign economic activity accelerated in the second quarter.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where foreign economic activity is picking up after a slow start, but it does not directly indicate a change in the stance of monetary policy. It is merely an observation of economic conditions abroad, which could potentially impact the domestic economy, but the sentence itself does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC. It is a neutral statement that does not imply a clear direction for future policy adjustments."
0,Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that labor costs are not rising and core inflation is decreasing, which suggests that there is less pressure on inflation. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the current economic conditions do not seem to be overheating in a way that would require a more hawkish stance to prevent inflation. Instead, the statement leans toward a dovish stance, where there might be room for easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, given that inflation is not trending above the target."
0,"Indeed, the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate would about offset the apparent increase in the real federal funds rate stemming from a recent decline in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the proposed reduction in the nominal federal funds rate is intended to offset an increase in the real federal funds rate due to a decline in inflation. This suggests a balancing act rather than a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The action is aimed at maintaining the current stance of monetary policy in real terms, rather than changing it, which aligns with a neutral policy stance."
0,"Many expected those conditions to be met later this year, although several members were concerned about downside risks to the outlook for real activity and inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that while many members expect the conditions for policy tightening to be met later in the year, there is also concern about potential negative risks to economic activity and inflation. This concern about downside risks suggests a cautious approach to tightening monetary policy, which aligns with a dovish stance. The dovish stance is characterized by a focus on stimulating the economy and a less aggressive approach to increasing interest rates, especially when there is uncertainty about economic growth and inflation pressures."
0,"Nonetheless, the risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were viewed as tilted a little to the downside, especially because the economy was not well positioned to withstand adverse shocks while the target for the federal funds rate was at its effective lower bound.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern for potential downside risks to economic growth and acknowledges the limited capacity of the economy to absorb negative shocks, given that the federal funds rate is at its effective lower bound. This suggests a cautious stance and a readiness to ease monetary policy if necessary to support the economy, aligning with a dovish approach."
2,"The slower growth of final spending resulted in inventory overhangs in a number of industries, most notably those related to the motor vehicle sector.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is slower growth in final spending leading to inventory overhangs, particularly in the motor vehicle sector. This observation is a statement of economic conditions rather than a clear indication of a future policy move. It does not directly suggest an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on current economic developments. The FOMC might consider such information when deciding on monetary policy, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific direction."
0,"Compared with the baseline, the disruption to economic activity was more severe and protracted in this scenario, with real GDP and inflation lower and the unemployment rate higher by the end of the medium-term projection.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a scenario where economic activity is severely disrupted, resulting in lower real GDP and inflation, and a higher unemployment rate. This suggests that the economy is underperforming relative to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. In such a context, a dovish stance would be appropriate, as it would indicate a potential easing of monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and counteract the negative trends mentioned."
2,"Given the substantial uncertainty still attached to projections of money growth consistent with the Committee's basic objectives for monetary policy, the members agreed that there was no firm basis for changing the tentative ranges set in July 1996.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members have decided not to change the previously set tentative ranges for money growth, due to substantial uncertainty in projections. This suggests a wait-and-see approach, maintaining the current policy stance without signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The decision reflects a balanced view, aiming to achieve the Committee's objectives without making adjustments based on uncertain projections."
2,"Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in July and August, with strong gains in private-sector jobs and declines in government employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation of employment trends without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. The solid rise in total nonfarm payroll employment and strong gains in private-sector jobs indicate a positive economic development, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the declines in government employment could be a concern but do not necessarily imply an immediate need for policy adjustment. The statement does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC will tighten or ease monetary policy in response to these employment changes, thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"Nonetheless, with rising productivity and moderate wage gains likely continuing to help hold down unit labor costs, the outlook for subdued inflation remained promising, especially for the nearer term.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that productivity increases and moderate wage gains are expected to keep unit labor costs low, which in turn indicates a favorable outlook for maintaining low inflation. This implies that there may be less need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat inflationary pressures, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current policy to encourage employment and economic growth without the immediate threat of inflation."
1,More information might provide a better sense of how the higher interest rates were affecting aggregate demand and perhaps also help--to a small degree--to shed light on the considerable uncertainties surrounding the relationship of output to inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a stance of observation and data gathering to better understand the impact of current policy measures (higher interest rates) on aggregate demand and the relationship between output and inflation. This approach is consistent with a balanced and cautious strategy, aiming to assess the effects of past actions before making further adjustments."
0,"Real GDP was forecast to decline and the unemployment rate to rise, on net, in the first half of this year.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates expectations of economic contraction (decline in Real GDP) and a worsening labor market (increase in the unemployment rate), which typically would lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and employment. This dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"While accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates should continue to undergird consumer spending and the data on retail sales for July displayed relatively impressive gains, negative wealth effects from falling stock market prices, declining payrolls, and sluggish income gains--should they persist--might well depress consumer expenditures over coming months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence presents a balanced view of the economic outlook, acknowledging both positive and negative factors that could influence consumer spending. On one hand, it mentions supportive elements like accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates, along with strong retail sales data, which could suggest a potential for a more hawkish stance if these factors lead to increased inflationary pressures. On the other hand, it also points out risks such as negative wealth effects from falling stock market prices, declining payrolls, and sluggish income gains, which could lead to a dovish response if they result in decreased consumer spending and lower inflation. Overall, the sentence does not clearly lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather indicates a watchful approach to future economic developments."
1,Any such rise in inflation expectations and associated upward pressure on inflation itself would likely prove costly to reverse.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern about rising inflation expectations and the subsequent impact on actual inflation, which could be difficult to reverse. This suggests a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to prevent or counteract inflationary pressures, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices. Tightening monetary policy is a typical response to rising inflation or inflation expectations, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"Stock prices in the basic materials and industrial sectors underperformed the broader market, reportedly reflecting an increase in trade tensions with China.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation related to stock prices in specific sectors and attributes the underperformance to increased trade tensions with China. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it provides context on economic conditions that might influence the FOMC's decision-making but does not suggest a specific policy action."
0,"Both total and core inflation were projected to move up slightly next year, as the low readings early this year were expected to be transitory, but nevertheless to continue to run below 2 percent.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both total and core inflation rates are expected to remain below the FOMC's 2% target, despite a slight projected increase. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy, as inflation is not a current concern, aligning with a dovish stance that would support maintaining or easing the current policy to stimulate the economy and move inflation towards the target rate."
0,"Nearly all measures of total and core prices had decelerated over the past year, and in the context of forecasts implying a continued sizable gap between actual and potential output, the risk that inflationary pressures would intensify significantly over coming quarters appeared to be quite limited; indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both total and core prices have been decelerating, and with forecasts showing a significant gap between actual and potential output, there is a low risk of inflationary pressures intensifying in the near future. In fact, the statement suggests that inflation could decrease slightly as the economy expands. This implies that there is less concern about inflation overshooting the target, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic growth and employment, aligning with a dovish approach."
2,"Although the required amount of cumulative tightening may have increased, members noted that an accelerated pace of policy tightening did not appear necessary at this time, as a degree of economic slack apparently remained, productivity growth would probably continue to damp increases in unit labor costs and prices, and inflation would most likely continue to be contained.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there may be a need for more tightening overall, an accelerated pace of tightening is not deemed necessary at the moment. This suggests a balanced approach, acknowledging the need for some tightening (which could be seen as hawkish) but also recognizing factors that allow for a more measured pace, such as economic slack, productivity growth, and contained inflation (which could be seen as dovish). The Committee is weighing the various aspects of the economy and does not signal a clear move towards either tightening or easing policy, but rather maintaining a steady approach."
1,"While the absence of increasing price inflation was a welcome development, members were concerned that the break with historical patterns might not persist.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that FOMC members are concerned about the potential for inflation to increase, despite the current absence of rising price inflation. This concern suggests that they are vigilant about inflationary pressures and may be inclined to tighten monetary policy to preempt any future increase in inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance. The focus on preventing inflation from rising demonstrates a commitment to the goal of stable prices, one of the key objectives of the FOMC."
1,"Broad equity price indexes decreased slightly, on net, as substantial early gains arising from investors' improved perceptions about the inflation outlook and better-than-feared second-quarter earnings were more than offset by later losses arising from expectations that the Committee would follow a more restrictive policy than previously expected.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that equity markets declined due to expectations that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would implement a more restrictive monetary policy than previously anticipated. A more restrictive policy typically means higher interest rates or less accommodative measures, which are associated with a hawkish stance. This is because such actions are usually taken to control inflation, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices. The reference to a ""more restrictive policy"" suggests a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a hawkish move."
2,Participants also generally agreed that the recent data had not led them to significantly change their outlooks for the most likely rates of economic growth and inflation in coming quarters.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the participants' economic outlooks for growth and inflation have not changed significantly based on recent data. This suggests that the FOMC does not see a need to adjust its current monetary policy stance aggressively in either direction (tightening or easing), as their expectations for key economic indicators remain stable."
1,"The pace of inventory liquidation was thought likely to moderate in coming quarters and subsequently turn to accumulation as inventories came into better balance with sales, with increasingly positive implications for overall production and economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about inventory management and its potential impact on production and economic activity, without directly suggesting an imminent change in monetary policy. It indicates a forecast of economic conditions rather than a clear stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement is more about the economic outlook and does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC would respond with a change in the monetary policy stance."
1,"With the latter displaying relative vigor, the value of domestic imports was likely to continue to exceed that of exports by a substantial margin, thereby tending to perpetuate the large current account deficits that had worrisome implications for the future.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an economic condition (large current account deficits due to a vigorous value of domestic imports exceeding exports) and its potential implications for the future, but it does not directly indicate a specific monetary policy action or stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges an economic observation that the FOMC might take into consideration when making future policy decisions."
1,"Nonfarm payroll employment increased sharply further in January and February, and the civilian unemployment rate, at 4.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates strong employment growth and a low unemployment rate, which could suggest a heating economy. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to inflationary pressures, prompting the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The sharp increase in employment and low unemployment rate are signs of a robust labor market, which is one of the FOMC's key indicators for potentially increasing interest rates to achieve its mandate of stable prices."
1,"The staff raised slightly its projection for inflation during the second half of this year, as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the staff expects inflation to be higher than previously anticipated due to persistent upward pressure from import and commodity prices. This suggests a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the FOMC's target, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to stabilize prices, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,The effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long-term interest rates and an abatement of energy-related headwinds.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that while there is an expectation of reduced policy stimulus (which could be considered HAWKISH as it implies a tightening of policy), this is expected to be offset by other factors such as low long-term interest rates and diminishing energy-related issues (which could be considered DOVISH as they imply supportive conditions for the economy). The balance of these factors indicates a stance that is neither clearly tightening nor easing, but rather maintaining a steady state of policy in response to changing economic conditions. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"The fundamentals underlying capital spending continued to be supportive, as business sector output expanded briskly, firms remained flush with funds, and relative price declines for high-tech equipment continued to push down its user cost.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the fundamentals for capital spending are strong, with rapid expansion in business sector output and firms having ample funds, alongside decreasing costs for high-tech equipment. This suggests a robust economic environment where inflationary pressures could build, potentially warranting a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and maintain price stability."
2,"The members viewed the outlook for core price inflation as still quite benign, largely reflecting the ample availability of labor and other producer resources to accommodate rising economic activity and the favorable prospects for further robust growth in productivity.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the members of the FOMC see little threat of inflation due to the ample availability of labor and other resources, as well as the expectation of strong productivity growth. This implies that there is no immediate need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation."
2,Several participants stated that such risks should not inhibit the Committee from pursuing its mandated objectives for inflation and employment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a commitment to the FOMC's objectives for inflation and employment without explicitly suggesting a direction for policy adjustment. It suggests that the Committee should not be deterred by risks when pursuing its goals, but it does not specify whether this means tightening or easing monetary policy. The focus is on adherence to mandates rather than a clear policy stance."
2,Major equity indexes appeared to be supported by lower interest rates and posted modest gains despite the increases in energy prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where equity markets are responding positively to lower interest rates, which could be a result of previous monetary policy easing. However, it also mentions increases in energy prices, which could be inflationary. The sentence does not explicitly indicate a future direction for monetary policy but rather describes current market conditions. It reflects the FOMC's observation of economic indicators without suggesting a clear move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
0,"A number of participants noted that continued high unemployment, particularly with large numbers of workers suffering very long spells of unemployment, would lead to an erosion of workers' skills that would have adverse consequences for those workers and for the economy's potential level of output in the longer term.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern over high unemployment and its long-term negative effects on the workforce and the economy's potential output. This concern suggests a stance that would favor easing monetary policy to support job creation and prevent skill erosion among workers, aligning with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment."
2,"In their assessment of the outlook for inflation, members agreed that although forecasts of more moderate growth in aggregate demand at a pace around potential output had substantially reduced the odds on rising inflation, the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while the growth in aggregate demand is expected to be moderate, aligning with potential output and thereby reducing the likelihood of rising inflation, the FOMC members still see the risks of inflation as tilted upwards. This suggests a concern for potential inflationary pressures, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent an overshoot of their long-term inflation target of 2%. The use of ""the risks still were pointed in that direction on balance"" implies a readiness to act against inflation, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"Financial factors also seemed likely on balance to accommodate continuing growth in consumer spending, in particular the marked increases that had occurred in the value of stock holdings and a still-ample availability of credit to most households.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that financial conditions, including rising stock values and the availability of credit, are supportive of continued growth in consumer spending. This implies that the economy is strong, which could lead to inflationary pressures if not counteracted by a tightening of monetary policy. The FOMC might consider these conditions as a reason to raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"Housing starts and the demand for new homes had declined further, house prices in many parts of the country were falling faster than they had towards the end of 2007, and inventories of unsold homes remained quite elevated.","DOVISH

The sentence describes a weakening in the housing market, with declining housing starts, falling house prices, and high inventories of unsold homes. This suggests that the economy might be facing downward pressures, which could lead to a dovish stance where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate demand and counteract these negative trends. The easing would be in line with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, as a weaker housing market could lead to lower employment in construction and related industries and potentially lower inflationary pressures from the housing sector."
2,"Members generally agreed that, in light of some weaker-than-expected readings on measures of labor market conditions and in the absence of greater confidence about the inflation outlook, it would be prudent to wait for additional information bearing on the medium-term outlook before initiating the process of policy normalization.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a preference for a cautious approach to monetary policy, suggesting that the FOMC members are not ready to tighten monetary policy due to weaker labor market conditions and uncertainty about inflation. Waiting for more information before starting policy normalization (which typically involves raising interest rates to prevent overheating of the economy) implies that they are leaning towards maintaining a more accommodative stance to support employment and ensure that inflation moves towards the target level. This approach is consistent with a dovish stance, which favors easier monetary policy to stimulate economic activity."
0,"Those factors included the increasing spread of the coronavirus in the United States since mid-June; the reactions of many states and localities in slowing or scaling back the reopening of their economies, especially for businesses, such as restaurants and bars, providing services that entail personal interactions; and some high-frequency indicators that pointed to a deceleration in economic activity.","DOVISH

The sentence describes factors that are likely to have a negative impact on economic activity, such as the spread of the coronavirus, the slowing or reversal of economic reopening, and indicators suggesting a slowdown in the economy. These conditions typically lead to a dovish monetary policy stance, as the central bank may consider easing policy to support economic growth and counteract the adverse effects of the pandemic on employment and economic activity. The focus on risks to the economy aligns with a dovish approach, which would aim to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates or other accommodative measures."
1,Some participants judged that a less accommodative future stance of policy would likely be warranted and that the Committee should convey a strong commitment to address elevated inflation pressures.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that some participants are considering a less accommodative (i.e., tighter) monetary policy in the future to address high inflation pressures. This suggests a potential move towards increasing interest rates or taking other actions to reduce monetary stimulus, which aligns with a hawkish stance aiming to curb inflation and maintain price stability, one of the key goals of the FOMC."
2,European equity prices were also lower over the period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""European equity prices were also lower over the period"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is simply a statement of fact regarding market conditions and does not reflect a policy inclination towards achieving maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates. It does not suggest any specific actions the FOMC might take in response to these market conditions."
2,"The staff's June projections for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation over the next few years were all a little lower, on balance, than those in its March forecast.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's projections for key economic indicators (unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation) as being slightly lower than previous forecasts, but it does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It simply provides an update on economic conditions, which could be interpreted in various ways depending on the context and the current state of the economy. Lower projections for these indicators do not inherently suggest a move towards either tightening or easing policy without additional context on how these projections align with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
1,Readings on consumer price inflation had picked up somewhat mainly because of increases in oil and gasoline prices earlier in the year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that consumer price inflation has increased, partly due to higher oil and gasoline prices. This observation suggests that inflationary pressures are present, which could lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Tightening monetary policy in response to rising inflation is considered a hawkish stance."
2,"Fiscal policy was expected to be somewhat less expansionary next year, though still an important contributor to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that fiscal policy will be less expansionary but will still contribute positively to economic growth. This statement does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides an assessment of fiscal policy's impact on the economy, which is one of the many factors the FOMC considers when making monetary policy decisions. The sentence does not explicitly indicate a shift towards more aggressive inflation control (hawkish) or stimulus measures (dovish), thus it is classified as neutral."
0,"However, some areas that were affected by the slowdown in the energy sector experienced house price declines or increases in mortgage delinquency rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes specific regional economic conditions related to the energy sector, mentioning house price declines and increases in mortgage delinquency rates in those areas. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of economic developments. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular direction of policy adjustment."
0,He was concerned that the flattening yield curve was partly due to falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about a flattening yield curve, which could be interpreted as a sign of potential economic slowdown or lower inflation expectations. The concern about falling longer-term inflation expectations or a lower neutral real rate of interest suggests that the FOMC might consider a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from falling below its target level. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, where the focus is on preventing inflation from dropping too low, which could signal a readiness to increase interest rates or take other actions to tighten monetary policy."
2,"Projections of the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, had a central tendency of 1-3/4 to 2-1/4 percent, on the high side of the outcome for 1997 when the rise in the index was held down by damped increases in food prices and declines in energy prices.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an inflation projection that is close to the FOMC's target rate of 2%, with a range slightly below and slightly above the target. It does not explicitly suggest a need for a change in monetary policy, as the projected inflation rate is within the acceptable range of the FOMC's long-term goal. The mention of the previous year's factors affecting inflation (food and energy prices) indicates an analysis of past data rather than a clear direction for future policy."
1,"Although readings on core inflation had improved modestly since the spring, nearly all participants viewed core inflation as uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants are concerned about high core inflation levels, despite a modest improvement. Their emphasis on the need for ""further moderation"" suggests they are inclined to take action to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation down towards their target level. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests a stance that is more aggressive in combating inflation, which is characteristic of a hawkish monetary policy."
2,"Moreover, the outlook for foreign economic activity also appeared a bit weaker.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a perception of weakening in foreign economic activity, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to counteract potential negative spillovers to the domestic economy. This dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's goals of supporting maximum employment and stable prices, as weaker foreign economic activity could dampen U.S. exports, economic growth, and inflationary pressures."
0,"First, the projected rates of productivity gains and potential output growth over the medium term were trimmed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an adjustment in the expectations for productivity gains and potential output growth, which does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions, but it does not in itself indicate a clear stance towards being more hawkish or dovish. The FOMC might adjust policy in response to such changes in projections, but this sentence alone does not reveal the direction of such adjustments."
1,"Participants judged that an appropriate firming of the stance of monetary policy, along with an eventual waning of supply–demand imbalances, would help to keep longer-term inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation down over time to levels consistent with the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the participants believe tightening monetary policy is appropriate to address inflation concerns. The use of the term ""firming of the stance of monetary policy"" suggests that they are considering actions that would typically involve increasing interest rates or taking other measures to reduce liquidity in the economy. This is aimed at keeping inflation expectations stable and bringing actual inflation down to the Committee's target level, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes combating inflation even if it might slow down economic growth or increase unemployment in the short term."
1,"On the upside, recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that fiscal policy changes might result in a stronger expansion of economic activity than currently anticipated, which could potentially lead to higher inflation or overheating of the economy. In response to such an outcome, the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from growing too quickly and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. This stance is therefore indicative of a potential move towards a tighter monetary policy, which is considered hawkish."
1,"Accordingly, much stronger growth in such investment could occur, with concomitant effects on incomes and the growth of overall spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests that there could be stronger growth in investment, which would positively affect incomes and overall spending. This statement does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather describes a potential economic outcome. It is a neutral observation that could be seen as a positive development for the economy, aligning with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without explicitly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance."
0,"Labor demand remained strong, and the labor market continued to be very tight.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the labor market is exhibiting strong demand and tightness, which often correlates with upward pressure on wages and potential inflationary concerns. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could suggest a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check."
1,The increase over the last few months in five-year measures of inflation compensation derived from Treasury nominal and inflation-indexed securities might be a warning sign that expectations were not as well anchored as they had been over the summer.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about rising inflation expectations, as evidenced by the increase in inflation compensation from Treasury securities. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level, in line with their commitment to stable prices. An increase in inflation expectations can lead to actual inflation if not addressed, which might prompt the FOMC to take a more hawkish stance to ensure price stability."
2,"While a number of members saw some slight further disinflation as the most plausible outcome, no one expected a material change in inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while some members expect a small decrease in inflation, there is no anticipation of a significant change in the inflation rate. This suggests that the FOMC members believe the current inflation rate is relatively stable, which does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The stance is balanced, reflecting neither a clear intent to adjust interest rates in response to changing inflation nor a significant concern about current inflation levels that would prompt a policy change."
0,"Treasury bond yields declined somewhat, perhaps reflecting both expectations of lower policy rates and greater investor demands for safety.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations and expectations without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance by the FOMC. It notes a decline in Treasury bond yields, which could be due to expectations of lower policy rates or a shift in investor preferences towards safer investments. This does not clearly suggest that the FOMC is either tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather it reflects market participants' perceptions and reactions to various factors."
2,"Overall employment gains were relatively well maintained, and labor markets were still tight though showing signs of softening.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that employment levels are holding steady and labor markets remain tight, but there are also indications of some softening. This suggests a balanced view where there is no clear direction towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might see the current situation as neither warranting an immediate policy change to cool down the economy (which would be hawkish) nor to stimulate it further (which would be dovish), as employment is still strong but with some signs of easing that could alleviate concerns about overheating."
1,Private nonfarm payroll employment increased appreciably on balance over September and October.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reports on a positive development in employment, which is one of the FOMC's goals (maximum employment). However, it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing. It simply states a fact about employment trends without indicating whether this would lead to an adjustment in monetary policy."
2,"Staff Economic Outlook In the forecast prepared for the March FOMC meeting, the staff's outlook for real economic activity was broadly similar to that at the time of the January meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the staff's economic outlook as being broadly similar to that of the previous meeting, without indicating a change in economic conditions that would warrant a shift in monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate concerns about inflation or employment that would lead to a tightening or easing of policy, thus it is best classified as neutral."
1,"While liquid deposits continued to grow slowly, heightened demand for safety and liquidity appeared to boost holdings of retail money market mutual funds.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a shift in the types of assets that investors are holding, with an increased preference for retail money market mutual funds, which are generally considered safe and liquid. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather reflects investor behavior in response to economic conditions. It does not suggest an immediate need for tightening or easing of monetary policy by the FOMC, as it does not explicitly relate to employment, inflation, or interest rates. Instead, it provides context on the financial environment, which the FOMC might consider when making future policy decisions."
1,The gains in employment over July and August were generally seen as larger than anticipated.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that employment gains were stronger than expected, which could suggest that the economy is performing well and potentially overheating. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could lead to inflationary pressures, prompting the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from running too hot. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
2,"Participants' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, meeting participants--the 7 members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in the deliberations of the FOMC--submitted their assessments of real output growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2013 through 2015 and over the longer run, under each participant's judgment of appropriate monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of assessment and does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy. It simply states that FOMC participants submitted their economic projections under their own judgments of appropriate monetary policy, without suggesting whether the policy should be tightened, eased, or remain the same."
0,"Given the pressure of a considerable amount of unused resources, any adverse developments that held down economic expansion would increase the probability of further disinflation.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that there is a significant amount of unused resources in the economy, which implies that there is slack in the economy that could lead to lower inflation or disinflation. This indicates a concern for underutilization in the economy, which could justify a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic expansion and prevent further disinflation. The focus on preventing disinflation aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, typically with a target inflation rate of 2%. Therefore, the sentence leans towards a dovish stance, as it implies a potential need for easing monetary policy to counteract the risks of disinflation and support economic growth."
2,"However, in the view of at least some members, recent developments had reduced the unwelcome prospect of substantial additional disinflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that some FOMC members believe that the risk of further significant decreases in inflation (disinflation) has diminished. This implies that there is less concern about falling inflation rates, which could reduce the likelihood of implementing further monetary easing measures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could indicate a stance that is less inclined to lower interest rates or engage in other expansionary monetary policies, hence a hawkish tilt."
1,"Once such expectations became imbedded in the economy, even stronger policy actions would be required in order to reestablish a downward trend of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that to prevent inflation expectations from becoming entrenched, the FOMC might need to take more aggressive policy actions, which typically means raising interest rates or tightening monetary policy to control inflation. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, focusing on curbing inflation even if it requires stronger measures."
0,"In those Districts in which activity had been adversely affected by the drop in energy prices, drilling activity was either contracting less rapidly or was stabilizing.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in specific districts where economic activity has been impacted by falling energy prices, noting that drilling activity is showing signs of less contraction or stabilization. This observation does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance but rather provides an update on economic conditions in certain regions. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy, but rather it reflects a neutral observation of regional economic developments."
2,The persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies that there is slack in the economy, with resources not being fully utilized, which is expected to lead to a decrease in core price inflation. This suggests that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy since inflation is anticipated to moderate on its own due to underutilization in the economy. This aligns with a dovish stance, which is typically associated with maintaining or easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
0,"In addition, the Committee reaffirmed its intention to keep the target federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and retained its forward guidance that it anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) intends to maintain a very low federal funds rate target, suggesting an easing stance to support economic activity until certain conditions related to unemployment and inflation are met. This dovish stance is aimed at stimulating the economy by keeping borrowing costs low to achieve maximum employment and stabilize prices, in line with the FOMC's goals of fostering economic conditions that achieve both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment. The specific conditions mentioned for maintaining the low rate target—unemployment remaining above a certain threshold and inflation projections being contained—underscore the Committee's commitment to an accommodative policy until substantial progress is made towards its objectives."
1,"In this regard the risks of rising inflation could not be dismissed, and while those risks appeared to be quite limited for the nearer term, excessive monetary stimulus had to be avoided to avert rising inflation expectations and added inflation pressures over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about the potential for rising inflation and suggests that excessive monetary stimulus should be avoided to prevent an increase in inflation expectations and additional inflationary pressures. This stance implies a preference for tightening monetary policy to ensure price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,"A couple of participants thought it premature to focus on this latter eventuality, observing that the purchase program had been effective and that more time was needed to assess the outlook for the labor market and inflation; moreover, international comparisons suggested that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet retained ample capacity relative to the scale of the U. S. economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some participants believe it is too early to consider stopping the purchase program, suggesting that they see the need for continued monetary support to assess the labor market and inflation outlook. The mention of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet having ample capacity implies that there is room for further monetary easing if necessary, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
0,"However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""However, growth of mortgage loans on banks' books slowed somewhat in the first half of this year"" does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is merely an observation of economic activity, specifically in the housing finance sector, which could be influenced by various factors, including previous monetary policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either increase or decrease the federal funds rate or adjust its monetary policy tools. It is a neutral comment on a particular segment of the economy without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
0,"Although single-family housing starts had come down substantially from their peak, the drop had lagged the decline in demand, and as a result, inventories of new homes had risen considerably.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation in the housing market where there has been a notable decrease in single-family housing starts, but this decrease has not kept pace with the decline in demand, leading to an increase in inventories of new homes. This observation is a factual statement about housing market conditions and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects economic conditions that the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions, but it does not in itself suggest a move towards a more hawkish or dovish policy. The sentence is more about the state of the housing market rather than a clear direction on the future path of monetary policy."
2,This evaluation assumed continued sluggish growth in final demand during the period immediately ahead.,"DOVISH

The sentence implies an expectation of weak economic demand in the near future. This suggests that the FOMC might lean towards an easing monetary policy stance to stimulate growth and move closer to achieving its goals of maximum employment and stable prices, especially if the sluggish demand could lead to a shortfall in employment or lower inflation."
0,"Moreover, if declines in house prices were to damp consumption, that could feed back on employment and income, exerting additional restraint on the demand for housing.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that a decline in house prices could lead to a reduction in consumption, which might negatively impact employment and income, further decreasing the demand for housing. This scenario describes a potential economic slowdown, which could prompt the FOMC to adopt a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and prevent a downturn. The dovish stance would be in line with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices, as easing monetary policy could help counteract the negative feedback loop described in the sentence."
0,"Subsequently, investors revised down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a reaction from investors to new information, specifically the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony, which led them to adjust their expectations about the future path of monetary policy. This sentence does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather reflects the market's interpretation of external communications and data. It suggests a change in investor expectations but does not provide information on the actual stance of the FOMC."
0,"M2 growth picked up appreciably during December and January, evidently reflecting extra demands for liquidity and safety during the century-date-change period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there was an increase in M2 growth, which is often associated with the money supply, during a specific period due to a higher demand for liquidity and safety. This observation is a factual statement about past economic conditions and does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. It simply reports on the behavior of the money supply during a period where there might have been unusual factors at play (the century-date-change period). The sentence does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC will adjust its policy in response to this change in M2 growth."
1,Factors pointing to potentially higher inflation included increased pressures on food prices stemming from disappointing harvests in some areas and relatively low grain supplies.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential inflationary pressures due to increased food prices and low grain supplies. This suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates to keep inflation in check, consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
0,"At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of 2008.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the producer price index for core intermediate materials, which is a measure of inflation at the production level, continued to decline. This suggests that inflationary pressures are not building up at the earlier stages of production. A declining or low inflation rate is often a signal for a central bank to maintain or ease monetary policy, rather than tighten it, to support economic activity and move closer to its inflation target. Therefore, the sentence leans toward a dovish stance, as it implies there may be room for monetary policy to remain accommodative without stoking inflation."
2,An easing of supply constraints was expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation.,"DOVISH

The sentence suggests that an improvement in supply constraints is anticipated to positively impact economic activity and employment while also contributing to a decrease in inflation. This implies that the conditions are expected to become more conducive to growth without necessarily leading to inflationary pressures, which could mean there is less urgency for tightening monetary policy to combat inflation. The expectation of easing supply constraints aligns with a dovish stance, as it indicates a scenario where the FOMC might not need to intervene aggressively to slow down the economy."
2,The staff interpreted the increases in prices of energy and nonmarket services that recently boosted consumer price inflation as largely transitory.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the staff of the FOMC views the recent increases in consumer price inflation, specifically from energy and nonmarket services, as largely transitory rather than permanent. This suggests that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as they expect the inflationary pressures to be temporary. Therefore, the stance is more aligned with a dovish approach, which is less aggressive in fighting inflation and more accommodating to support economic growth, assuming that the inflation will subside on its own without the need for intervention."
1,"Recent data, supported by anecdotal reports from several though not all parts of the country, suggested that residential building activity was slowing somewhat, apparently in lagged response to earlier increases in mortgage interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in residential building activity due to past increases in mortgage interest rates. It does not directly indicate an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather reports on the effects of previous policy actions. The statement is simply providing an update on economic developments, which is part of the FOMC's regular assessment of the economy. It does not suggest any imminent policy changes, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"The vote encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2:00 p. m. : ""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where economic activity is picking up after a slowdown, attributing the slowdown to temporary factors like adverse weather conditions. This statement does not explicitly indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of recent economic conditions, which is a common practice in FOMC statements as part of their transparent communication strategy. The mention of growth in economic activity could be seen as a positive sign, but without additional context on inflation and employment, it does not suggest a definitive move towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Inflation had been subdued of late, although the recent increase in crude oil and gasoline prices would push up inflation temporarily.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges a current state of low inflation but also recognizes a factor (rising crude oil and gasoline prices) that is expected to cause a temporary increase in inflation. This statement does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, as it suggests a transitory effect on inflation rather than a sustained change that would warrant a policy adjustment. It reflects an observation of the economic conditions without a direct implication for immediate policy action."
1,"In its accompanying statement, the Committee indicated that, despite elevated energy prices and hurricane-related disruptions, the expansion in economic activity appeared solid.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the Committee views the economy as strong and resilient, even in the face of adverse events such as high energy prices and natural disasters. This implies that the economy is growing solidly, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In such a context, the FOMC might be more inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices. The use of the word ""solid"" to describe the expansion in economic activity indicates confidence in the economy's performance, which is typically associated with a hawkish stance."
1,"However, reports from business contacts in several Districts indicated that employers in labor markets in which demand was high or in which workers in some occupations were in short supply were raising wages noticeably to compete for workers and limit turnover.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that in certain labor markets, there is high demand for workers or a shortage in specific occupations, leading employers to raise wages significantly to attract and retain employees. This scenario suggests upward pressure on wages, which could contribute to inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could signal a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,A couple of participants remarked that the very low levels of inventories would likely be a factor supporting increases in production as demand continued to recover.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants expect an increase in production due to low inventory levels as demand recovers, which is a comment on economic conditions rather than a direct indication of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather discusses a factor that could influence economic activity."
2,Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable"" suggests that inflation expectations are neither rising nor falling significantly, which indicates that the current monetary policy stance is effectively anchoring inflation expectations around the target level. This stability is consistent with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and does not by itself suggest an immediate need for a change in policy towards either tightening or easing."
2,"Many of them expected that inflation was likely to rise gradually over the medium term, as resource slack diminished and inflation expectations remained stable.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC participants expect inflation to increase as the economy uses up excess capacity (resource slack) and inflation expectations stay stable. This anticipation of rising inflation could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding the Committee's long-term target of 2%. The focus on preventing an increase in inflation typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as it may involve raising interest rates or taking other measures to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
0,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy changes (tightening or easing). It outlines the Committee's broad goals of maximum employment and price stability, which are consistent with its long-term objectives and statutory mandate. The sentence does not indicate a shift towards a more aggressive or accommodative stance, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"However, the deficit was up appreciably from its average for the first quarter, with the value of imports increasing substantially more than the value of exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the trade balance, specifically the deficit and the relative change in the value of imports and exports. This information is more related to fiscal policy and trade dynamics than to the direct tools of monetary policy such as interest rates or asset purchases. While trade deficits can have implications for the economy, the sentence does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It does not provide clear evidence of the FOMC's intentions to adjust monetary policy to achieve maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion in economic activity has slowed considerably after a very rapid advance in the first quarter.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that economic activity has slowed down significantly after a period of rapid growth. This suggests that the economy might be cooling, which could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support growth and prevent a potential downturn. The slowdown in expansion aligns with a dovish approach, where the FOMC might consider easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity and move closer to its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Inflation had been subdued, even though the prices of some key commodities had increased recently.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite the rise in prices of some commodities, overall inflation remains subdued. This suggests that there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current monetary policy to support economic growth and employment."
1,"A couple of participants referred to information from business contacts suggesting that inflation was unlikely to decline further, and a few expressed concerns that maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for an extended period could erode the stability of inflation expectations over time and hence posed upside risks to the inflation outlook.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about potential inflation risks associated with a highly accommodative monetary policy stance if maintained for an extended period. The mention of the possibility that inflation may not decline and that there could be an erosion of stable inflation expectations suggests that some FOMC participants are considering the need to tighten monetary policy to prevent higher inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
1,"Although the initial offerings of these securities were well received, investor demand at the most recent sales was not as strong, a development consistent with the declines in the prices of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities over the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding investor demand and security prices, without directly indicating a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance. It provides information on market conditions rather than the FOMC's policy intentions."
2,"Two members preferred to leave the target range at 1 to 1-1/4 percent, suggesting that the Committee should wait to raise the target range until inflation moves up closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis or inflation expectations increase.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that two members of the FOMC preferred to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, rather than increasing it, until inflation approaches the 2 percent target more closely or inflation expectations rise. This preference for waiting to tighten monetary policy until there is clearer evidence of inflation aligns with a dovish stance, which is generally associated with keeping monetary policy more accommodative to support economic growth and employment."
1,"Mr. Plosser noted that the Committee could not afford to wait until there was clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored, as by then it would be too late to prevent a further increase in inflation pressures.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for rising inflation pressures and the need to act preemptively to prevent them from escalating. Mr. Plosser's statement suggests that waiting for more evidence could result in it being too late to address inflation effectively, implying a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy to maintain price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives. This preemptive approach to managing inflation expectations is typically associated with a hawkish monetary policy stance."
0,"Most believed that downside risks to economic growth had diminished somewhat since the April meeting, but were still significant.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC members see some improvement in economic growth risks since their last meeting, they still consider the risks to be considerable. This suggests a balanced view, as it does not clearly signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy. The acknowledgment of reduced downside risks could be seen as slightly hawkish, as it implies less need for accommodative measures. However, the continued presence of significant risks also has a dovish implication, suggesting that the Committee might not be ready to tighten policy yet. Overall, the sentence reflects a stance of watchfulness and does not commit to a specific policy direction, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"With inflation low and resource use slack, the Committee saw no need for tightening policy in the near future.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC sees no immediate need to tighten monetary policy because inflation is low and there is slack in resource utilization. This suggests a stance towards easing or maintaining the current level of monetary accommodation, as there is no pressure to combat high inflation or overheating in the economy, which aligns with a dovish policy stance."
0,"On the one hand, an inverted yield curve could indicate an increased risk of recession; on the other hand, the low level of term premiums in recent years--reflecting, in part, central bank asset purchases--could temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the implications of an inverted yield curve and the effects of central bank asset purchases on the reliability of the yield curve as an economic indicator. It does not directly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather weighs different factors that could influence economic forecasts. The mention of an increased risk of recession could be seen as dovish, as it might imply a need for easing to counteract a downturn. However, the statement also notes that the low level of term premiums, partly due to central bank asset purchases, could make the yield curve a less reliable indicator, which does not necessarily advocate for a specific monetary policy action. Overall, the sentence presents a balanced view, considering both risks and the current financial environment without indicating a clear move towards either tightening or easing policy."
2,Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Those indicators were mixed regarding the pace of economic activity within the manufacturing sector"" does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that there is no consistent signal from the manufacturing sector that would prompt a change in policy stance, thus reflecting a balanced or unclear stance on monetary policy."
2,"Consumer spending was projected to increase at a rate generally in line with the anticipated rise in disposable income; the favorable effects on household wealth of the advance that had occurred in stock prices and the ample availability of credit for most borrowers were expected to balance the damping effects of continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings, the security of their jobs, and the extent of their debt burdens.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a balance between positive factors (increase in disposable income, rise in stock prices, and credit availability) and negative concerns (savings adequacy, job security, and debt burdens) that are expected to influence consumer spending. It does not explicitly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather suggests a steady state where various factors are expected to offset each other. This reflects a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be weighing different aspects of the economy without signaling a clear direction for policy change."
2,"In their discussion of prices, participants indicated that data over the intermeeting period, including measures of inflation expectations, suggested that underlying inflation was not in the process of moving higher.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the underlying inflation is not showing signs of increasing, as evidenced by recent data and measures of inflation expectations. This implies that there may be less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat rising inflation, aligning with a dovish stance that would favor maintaining or easing current policy to support employment and economic growth, given that inflation is not perceived as a threat at the moment."
0,The deceleration seemed to reflect primarily an unwinding of heightened demand for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds that had boosted M2 in prior months.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the deceleration in the growth of M2 (a measure of the money supply) is attributed to a change in investor behavior rather than a direct result of monetary policy actions. It indicates a normalization of demand for money market mutual funds rather than signaling a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. The focus is on explaining past movements in monetary aggregates rather than outlining future policy directions."
2,"The hurricanes were also expected to depress payroll employment in September, with a reversal over the next few months.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a temporary situation expected to impact employment due to natural disasters, with an anticipated reversal in the following months. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy stance but rather acknowledges an external, nonmonetary factor affecting employment. This statement is more about the conditions affecting the economy rather than the FOMC's policy response to those conditions."
0,"Nonetheless, participants viewed the housing situation and its potential further effect on employment, income, and wealth as one of the major sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates concern about the housing market and its potential negative impact on employment, income, and wealth, which are seen as downside risks to the economic outlook. This suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to ease monetary policy to mitigate these risks, aligning with a dovish stance that supports economic growth and employment."
1,The members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC members are concerned about the potential for increased inflation pressures and are considering further tightening of monetary policy to manage these pressures. The reference to ""further tightening actions"" suggests a stance towards raising interest rates or taking other measures to restrict monetary supply, which is consistent with a hawkish approach aimed at containing inflation and maintaining price stability."
2,"In contrast to price inflation, labor costs appeared to have remained quiescent.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that labor costs, which are a component of overall inflation, have not been rising. This implies that there is less pressure on the FOMC to raise interest rates to combat inflation, as labor costs are not contributing to inflationary pressures. A dovish stance is typically associated with lower interest rates to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a concern."
0,The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected slowdown in business investment spending due to specific factors, including market saturation for potential computer markets. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an analysis of economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on market conditions and investment spending is a neutral observation that does not inherently suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy."
2,"Most Committee members, while acknowledging the deficiencies of structural models, viewed them as useful in their efforts to understand how the inflation process was changing and also as input to inflation forecasts.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Committee members' views on the usefulness of structural models for understanding changes in the inflation process and aiding in inflation forecasts. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a methodological approach to analyzing economic conditions. The focus is on the tools used to achieve the FOMC's goals, rather than on the direction of policy change."
0,"Also, the recent evidence could be interpreted as indicating that the surprisingly sharp decline in measured inflation in 2003 exaggerated the drop in the underlying rate of inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the actual underlying rate of inflation may not have decreased as much as the measured figures from 2003 indicated. This could imply that inflation pressures are higher than previously thought, which might lead the FOMC to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance."
0,The external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the external sector will have a slight dampening effect on economic activity, but it does not directly suggest a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy. It simply provides an assessment of one of the many factors that the FOMC considers when making policy decisions. The statement does not explicitly indicate that the FOMC will adjust the federal funds rate or change its monetary policy stance in response to the external sector's influence. Therefore, it is best classified as neutral, as it does not clearly signal an intention to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation."
1,"A discernable upcreep was apparent in survey measures of short- and, to a limited extent, long-term inflation expectations over recent months.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a noticeable increase in both short- and long-term inflation expectations according to survey measures. Rising inflation expectations can signal potential inflationary pressures in the economy, which the Federal Reserve might counteract with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices and a 2% inflation rate over the long term. Therefore, the sentence suggests a stance that leans towards the possibility of monetary policy tightening, which is considered hawkish."
1,"Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Employment continued to expand unevenly, while labor productivity remained on a strong upward trend"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of uneven employment expansion suggests that the labor market is not consistently robust across sectors or regions, which could be a concern for the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. However, the strong upward trend in labor productivity could be seen as a positive sign for economic efficiency and potential non-inflationary growth. Since the sentence presents a mixed view with both a potentially negative and positive aspect, it is best classified as NEUTRAL, reflecting a balanced perspective without a clear inclination towards a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"Some business executives reportedly believed that, with aggregate demand expanding robustly and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar putting upward pressure on import prices, a degree of ""pricing power"" had returned.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that business executives are observing robust expansion in aggregate demand and an increase in import prices due to a lower foreign exchange value of the dollar, which suggests that there might be inflationary pressures. The mention of a return of ""pricing power"" implies that businesses might be able to pass on higher costs to consumers, which could further fuel inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this situation might warrant a tightening of monetary policy to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"In general, financial markets were viewed as well positioned to support more vigorous expansion in economic activity.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that financial markets are in a state that could support a stronger expansion in economic activity. This implies that the economy is robust enough to potentially handle a tightening of monetary policy without stifling growth, as the markets are capable of sustaining a more vigorous expansion. The FOMC might consider this an opportunity to raise interest rates or reduce monetary accommodation to prevent overheating and keep inflation in check, aligning with their goal of stable prices."
1,"Participants expected that, with further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, economic activity would expand at a solid rate during the remainder of this year and a moderate pace in the medium term, and that labor market conditions would remain strong.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that participants anticipate further gradual increases in the federal funds rate, which is a sign of tightening monetary policy. This action is consistent with a hawkish stance, as it suggests a focus on preventing the economy from overheating and keeping inflation in check, in line with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The expectation that economic activity will continue to expand and labor market conditions will remain strong implies confidence in the economy's resilience to higher interest rates."
2,"In their review of the outlook for prices, members noted that incoming data over the intermeeting period had shown a slowing in core inflation from the high levels posted earlier in the year, consistent with the Committee's view that a portion of the earlier increase had reflected transitory factors.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation is slowing down from previously high levels, which the Committee believes is partly due to transitory factors. This suggests that the FOMC sees less persistent inflationary pressure, which could reduce the need for aggressive tightening of monetary policy, aligning with a dovish stance that supports easing or maintaining the current policy rather than tightening."
1,"Total U. S. consumer prices, as measured by the PCE price index, increased 1.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is incomplete and does not give a full context or indicate a clear direction of the monetary policy stance. It merely starts to state a fact about the measurement of consumer prices by the PCE price index without providing information on whether the increase is above, below, or in line with the FOMC's inflation target of 2%. Without additional information on the rate of increase and the Committee's response or interpretation of this data, it is not possible to determine whether the stance is hawkish, dovish, or neutral. Therefore, the classification is neutral, reflecting a balanced or unclear stance based on the information given."
0,"Still, most members projected that over the next couple of years, the unemployment rate would remain quite elevated and the level of inflation would remain below rates consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's objectives.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that most FOMC members expect unemployment to stay high and inflation to remain below the Federal Reserve's long-term target for the next few years. This suggests that the Committee might be inclined to maintain or introduce policies that stimulate the economy, as high unemployment and low inflation are conditions that typically warrant an easing of monetary policy to support growth and help inflation move towards the target level."
2,"""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable economic growth, which are key objectives of the central bank. It does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather describes the overall goals of the FOMC. The statement is balanced and does not lean towards a hawkish or dovish stance, as it does not provide specific information on the current economic conditions or the necessary adjustments to the monetary policy."
2,The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The staff's outlook for inflation was broadly unchanged"" does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC's view on inflation has not shifted, implying that their current policy stance is likely to remain the same until new data or developments suggest a change is necessary. This statement reflects a balanced approach consistent with the FOMC's commitment to stable prices, without signaling a move towards either a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy stance."
0,"Core consumer price inflation continued to slow, and inflation expectations remained subdued over the closing months of 2003.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core consumer price inflation is decreasing and inflation expectations are low, which suggests that there is less pressure on prices. This could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy, as the inflation rate is moving towards or is below the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. Therefore, the statement leans towards a dovish stance, as it suggests conditions that might warrant an easing of monetary policy to support economic activity and prevent inflation from falling too far below the target."
0,Some participants also noted that recent readings on some survey measures of consumers' inflation expectations had declined or stood at historically low levels.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that consumers' inflation expectations are either decreasing or are at historically low levels. This suggests that inflation pressures may be subdued, which could imply that there is less urgency for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. Lower inflation expectations are generally consistent with a dovish stance, as they provide the central bank with more leeway to maintain or ease monetary policy to support employment without the immediate risk of triggering high inflation."
1,"Key factors that influence consumer spending--including a low unemployment rate, ongoing gains in real labor compensation, and still elevated measures of households' net worth--were supportive of a pickup in consumer spending to a solid pace in the near term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are strong economic factors such as low unemployment, rising real labor compensation, and high household net worth that are expected to support an increase in consumer spending. This suggests that the economy is performing well, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, this could imply a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
0,"However, reports from a couple of Districts indicated that the agricultural sector was still weak, with low commodity prices continuing to put financial pressure on farm-related businesses.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a specific sector's economic condition (agriculture) and does not directly indicate a change in the overall monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy but rather provides an update on economic conditions in a particular sector. This information might be used to inform the FOMC's decisions, but it does not in itself imply a shift in policy direction."
0,"If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is prepared to continue or potentially increase its asset purchases if the labor market does not show significant improvement, provided that price stability is maintained. This suggests a willingness to ease monetary policy further to support employment, which aligns with a dovish stance. The mention of ""price stability"" ensures that this dovish approach is contingent upon not igniting inflation beyond the target, but the primary focus on supporting the labor market indicates a bias towards monetary easing."
0,"Major reasons for optimism about the outlook were the substantial easing in monetary policy, whose lagged effects would be felt increasingly in the year ahead, and the fiscal stimulus measures that already had been enacted and might well be supplemented over coming months.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a positive view on the economy due to recent easing in monetary policy and fiscal stimulus measures. The mention of ""substantial easing in monetary policy"" suggests that the FOMC has recently implemented policies to make monetary conditions more accommodative, which is typically associated with a dovish stance. This easing is expected to positively impact the economy in the future, which aligns with the goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices but does not suggest any immediate move towards tightening."
2,"While there were no current indications that inflation might be accelerating and no policy move was called for at this time, the members saw a need for continuing vigilance.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a cautious approach towards inflation, suggesting that while there is no immediate evidence of accelerating inflation, the members remain alert to the potential need for policy action to prevent such an outcome. This vigilance implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy if signs of inflation emerge, aligning with a hawkish stance that prioritizes price stability."
1,"A number of business contacts indicated that they were passing on at least a portion of these higher costs to their customers or that they planned to try to do so later this year; however, contacts were uncertain about the extent to which they could raise prices, given current market conditions and the cautious attitudes toward spending still held by households and businesses.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where businesses are facing higher costs and are attempting to pass these costs on to customers, but there is uncertainty about their ability to do so due to market conditions and cautious spending attitudes. This reflects a balance between inflationary pressures (businesses trying to raise prices) and the potential dampening effect of market resistance and spending caution. It does not clearly indicate a need to tighten or ease monetary policy, as it presents both upward pressure on prices and potential constraints on that pressure. The FOMC might interpret this as a need to wait for more definitive data before adjusting policy."
2,The U. S. international trade deficit declined somewhat in May after reaching a record high in April.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply reports a factual development regarding the U.S. international trade deficit without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy or indicating a stance on the future path of policy. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"More broadly, signs of a pickup in growth in economic activity in some AFEs and emerging Asian economies other than China also appeared to contribute to the improvement in sentiment in financial markets.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of economic conditions, specifically noting an improvement in growth and sentiment in financial markets in certain advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging Asian economies, excluding China. It does not directly indicate a shift towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather provides context on global economic developments that could influence the FOMC's decision-making. The statement is neutral as it does not suggest a clear direction for future monetary policy adjustments but rather informs about the current economic situation."
0,"Strong fundamentals, including low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, were seen as supporting expenditures on software and equipment going forward.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current economic conditions, noting strong fundamentals such as low interest rates, wide profit margins, and a high level of liquid assets, which are expected to support future expenditures on software and equipment. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of the economic environment that could influence future policy decisions. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy, hence it is classified as neutral."
2,"Moreover, a change in the ranges might be misinterpreted as a signal of greater reliance on the broad monetary aggregates in the formulation and conduct of monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential for misinterpretation of policy signals related to the use of broad monetary aggregates, without indicating a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a concern about communication and the perception of policy rather than a direct policy stance."
2,"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that a slightly higher federal funds rate might be acceptable or a somewhat lower federal funds rate would be acceptable during the intermeeting period.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is open to adjusting the federal funds rate in either direction, suggesting a balanced approach to monetary policy. The use of ""slightly higher"" or ""somewhat lower"" implies small adjustments based on economic conditions, without a clear bias towards tightening or easing. This reflects a neutral stance, as the Committee is expressing a willingness to respond to economic indicators in a way that maintains its long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth."
1,"Consumer prices jumped in October, as hurricane damage contributed to higher prices for food and energy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that consumer prices have increased, specifically mentioning external factors (hurricane damage) that have led to higher prices for food and energy. This could suggest inflationary pressures that the FOMC might respond to with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its stable prices goal, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
0,Members again mentioned concerns on the part of business contacts regarding the adverse economic implications of very large deficits for the economy over the longer term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects concerns about the potential long-term economic impact of large deficits but does not directly indicate an immediate stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests awareness of fiscal conditions that could affect the economy but does not imply a specific monetary policy action. The FOMC is acknowledging a risk factor that could influence future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a more hawkish or dovish approach at the moment."
2,"So far this year, payroll employment had expanded at a faster pace than last year and the unemployment rate had declined further, although it remained elevated.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the current state of employment, noting both improvements (faster expansion of payroll employment and a decline in the unemployment rate) and ongoing challenges (the unemployment rate remains elevated). This statement does not explicitly indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of the labor market conditions. It suggests that while there has been progress towards the goal of maximum employment, there is still room for improvement. The sentence does not directly address inflation or interest rates, which are also key considerations for the FOMC's policy stance."
0,Most other market interest rates declined further on balance over the period in an atmosphere of greater volatility in financial markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation rather than a direct action or intention of the FOMC. It notes that most market interest rates declined and that there was greater volatility, but it does not indicate whether the FOMC views this as positive or negative, nor does it suggest a policy response. The decline in interest rates could be due to various factors, including market participants' expectations about future economic conditions or central bank policies, but without additional context on the FOMC's stance or intended actions, the sentence itself is neutral."
1,"Inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year, largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non-energy imports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation of higher inflation due to specific categories (food and non-energy imports), but it does not directly suggest a policy action such as tightening or easing. It merely states an observation about inflation trends without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustments. The FOMC might consider this information in the context of their broader goals, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
2,"Consistent with the Committee's decision to leave the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged, the Board of Governors voted unanimously to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances at 0.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee has decided to maintain the status quo regarding the target range for the federal funds rate and the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances, which suggests a stance of not tightening monetary policy. Keeping rates unchanged, especially at a low level (0% in this case), is typically associated with a dovish stance, as it aims to support economic activity by making borrowing cheaper and encouraging investment and spending, which can be particularly important if the economy is not overheating or if inflation is not above the target."
2,"The Committee reiterated, however, that purchases were not on a preset course, and that its decisions about the pace of purchases would remain contingent on its outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is maintaining a flexible approach to its asset purchase program, with decisions being made based on economic indicators related to the labor market and inflation, as well as the perceived benefits and costs of the purchases. This suggests a balanced stance, as the Committee is neither committing to tightening (which would be hawkish) nor easing (which would be dovish) monetary policy without further evaluation of economic conditions. The statement reflects a readiness to adjust policy as needed to achieve its goals of maximum employment and price stability, without indicating a clear direction towards either easing or tightening."
0,"Moreover, economic theory indicates that the equilibrium level of short-term real interest rates would likely remain low relative to estimates of its level before the financial crisis if trend growth of total factor productivity does not pick up and if demographic projections for slow growth in working-age populations are borne out.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential long-term trends in real interest rates based on economic theory, productivity growth, and demographic changes. It does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an assessment of underlying economic conditions that could influence future policy decisions. The focus on equilibrium levels of interest rates in the context of productivity and demographic trends suggests a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
1,"Weekly data for March, however, indicated that gasoline prices rose sharply.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there has been a sharp increase in gasoline prices, which could contribute to higher inflation. Rising inflation is typically a concern for the FOMC, and if it is deemed to be above their target level, the Committee may consider tightening monetary policy to keep inflation in check. Therefore, the statement suggests a situation that might lead to a more hawkish stance to prevent the economy from overheating."
1,"They also generally expected that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants expect that continued gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would align with the goals of economic expansion, strong labor market conditions, and achieving the inflation target. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as increasing the federal funds rate typically corresponds to reducing inflationary pressures and cooling down the economy to prevent overheating. The use of ""further gradual increases"" implies an ongoing process of raising interest rates, which is a hawkish stance."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad goals that the FOMC aims to achieve through its policy decisions. The focus on both price stability and sustainable growth suggests a balanced approach to managing the dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run. ""","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee expects to maintain the target federal funds rate below what is considered normal for an extended period, even when employment and inflation are close to the FOMC's goals. This suggests a stance towards easing, as they are signaling a willingness to keep rates lower to support the economy, rather than tightening monetary policy to combat potential inflation or overheating in the labor market. This dovish approach aligns with a focus on nurturing employment and ensuring that inflation remains under control without preemptively raising rates."
0,"In their discussion of inflation developments, participants noted that readings on overall and core PCE inflation, measured on a 12-month change basis, had continued to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that both overall and core PCE inflation rates are running below the FOMC's 2 percent target. This suggests that inflation is not currently a concern, and there may be room for a more accommodative monetary policy to stimulate the economy and move inflation towards the target level. The use of the word ""continued"" implies that this is an ongoing situation, reinforcing the dovish implication that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy."
2,"However, in light of the projected persistence of slack in labor and product markets and the anticipated stability in long-term inflation expectations, the increase in inflation was expected to be mostly transitory if oil and other commodity prices did not rise significantly further.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the increase in inflation is expected to be temporary and is contingent on the stability of oil and other commodity prices. It also mentions the persistence of slack in labor and product markets, which implies that there is less pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. This stance aligns with a dovish approach, where the focus is on supporting employment and not raising interest rates aggressively in response to what is perceived as a temporary inflationary spike."
0,"In their discussion of forward guidance about the target federal funds rate, a few members suggested that lowering the unemployment threshold to 6 percent could effectively convey the Committee's intention to keep the target federal funds rate low for an extended period.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members are considering a more accommodative policy stance by suggesting a lower unemployment threshold for maintaining low interest rates. This implies a willingness to keep monetary policy easy to support employment, which aligns with a dovish approach to stimulate the economy and suggests less concern about inflationary pressures at that moment."
2,"Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance."" suggests that there has been no significant change in the market's expectations for inflation in the long term. This indicates a stable outlook on inflation, which neither clearly signals a need for tightening monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor suggests an immediate need for easing (which would be dovish). The statement is balanced and does not commit to a particular direction of policy change, thus it is classified as neutral."
2,"As a result, growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below the rapid pace in the first half of last year, and housing demand would increase only a little from its recent level.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes expectations about consumer spending and housing demand without directly indicating a change in monetary policy. It suggests a slowdown in the growth of spending on consumer durables compared to the previous year and a modest increase in housing demand, which are observations of economic conditions rather than actions by the FOMC. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not convey a clear stance toward tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Core price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation of rising core price inflation due to higher import prices and increases in nominal labor compensation that are not entirely balanced by productivity growth. This suggests that inflationary pressures are anticipated to grow, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent inflation from exceeding the FOMC's target. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may raise interest rates or take other actions to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check."
1,"Although a spike in energy prices eroded real income growth in the second quarter, there were solid gains in wages and salaries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both a negative factor (a spike in energy prices eroding real income growth) and a positive factor (solid gains in wages and salaries), which suggests a balanced view of economic conditions. It does not clearly indicate a move towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of different economic indicators that could have offsetting effects on the economy. The FOMC might consider these factors in the context of their dual mandate, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy direction."
2,"Some members commented, however, that the relationship between the output gap and inflation was quite loose and that the outlook for productivity remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a discussion among FOMC members about the uncertain relationship between the output gap (the difference between actual and potential economic output) and inflation, as well as the unpredictability of productivity trends. This reflects a neutral stance because it does not clearly suggest an immediate need to either tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it points to ongoing uncertainty and the need for further monitoring of economic indicators before making a decisive policy move. The focus on the output gap and productivity relates to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but the statement does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,"In several Districts, reports from business contacts or evidence from surveys pointed to some difficulty in finding qualified workers; in some cases, labor shortages were making it hard to fill customer demand or expand business.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there are labor shortages in several districts, which can lead to upward pressure on wages as businesses compete for qualified workers. This could contribute to inflationary pressures, suggesting that there might be a need for tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check. The FOMC might consider such information as a signal to raise interest rates or take other actions to cool down the labor market and align with their goal of stable prices."
0,"Another participant mentioned, however, that recent sluggish growth of the monetary aggregates suggested that the stance of policy was not overly accommodative.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the slow growth of monetary aggregates (such as money supply) indicates that the current monetary policy is not too stimulative or loose. This suggests that there may be no need to ease policy further, and it could even hint at a bias towards tightening if economic conditions warrant, to prevent potential inflationary pressures. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which favors tighter monetary policy to control inflation."
2,"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that while inflation is expected to decrease, it will remain above the FOMC's target rate of 2 percent by the end of the year. This suggests that the FOMC may need to continue or implement measures to tighten monetary policy in order to bring inflation down to the target level, consistent with a hawkish stance."
0,"Many members concluded that because there did not seem to be any urgency to tighten current policy for domestic reasons, given the likelihood that inflation would remain subdued for a while, important weight should be given to potential reactions abroad.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that many FOMC members do not see a pressing need to tighten monetary policy due to the expectation that inflation will remain low for some time. This suggests a leaning towards maintaining or easing the current policy stance rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish approach to monetary policy. The emphasis on the lack of urgency and the consideration of international reactions further supports a stance that is not in favor of immediate policy tightening."
0,The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The moderation reflected lower growth in most major expenditure sectors"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply states an observation about economic conditions, specifically a slowdown in growth across various expenditure sectors. This could be a precursor to either a dovish or hawkish stance depending on the context, such as whether the moderation is seen as a risk to employment or inflation. However, without additional context suggesting a policy shift, the statement remains neutral."
1,"At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: ""The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's general mandate to foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output, which is a statement of their overall objectives rather than an indication of a change in policy stance. It does not provide specific information about tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather outlines the broad goals that guide the Committee's actions."
1,"Despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for September, measures of inflation compensation calculated using yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remained a bit above the levels seen before Hurricane Katrina.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while there was a significant rise in the consumer price index, which could suggest inflationary pressures (a point that might be considered hawkish), the measures of inflation compensation did not change much during the same period. This suggests that the market's long-term inflation expectations remained stable, despite the short-term increase in inflation. The mention of the levels being a bit above pre-Hurricane Katrina suggests some awareness of external, nonmonetary factors affecting inflation. Overall, the sentence does not clearly lean towards a tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an observation that balances concerns about inflation with evidence of stable inflation expectations."
0,"However, core inflation had been subdued in recent months and longer-run inflation expectations remained contained.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that core inflation has been low recently and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which suggests there is no immediate pressure to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation. This could imply that the FOMC might lean towards maintaining or easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth, as inflation is not currently seen as a threat to their long-term target of 2%."
1,"With today's action, the real federal funds rate--measured as the difference between the nominal funds rate and a moving average of core PCE inflation--would move slightly into positive territory.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is raising the nominal federal funds rate to a level where, after accounting for core PCE inflation, the real interest rate becomes positive. This suggests a tightening of monetary policy, as a positive real interest rate can help to slow down inflation by making borrowing more expensive and saving more attractive, which is consistent with a hawkish stance."
2,"If the recent slower rate of price declines on high-tech products implied a softer underlying pace of technological change, both the outlook for investment demand and the prospects for persisting high trend growth in productivity could be damped relative to previous expectations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential implications of a slower rate of price declines in high-tech products on investment demand and productivity growth. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather assesses factors that could influence economic conditions. The focus is on understanding how changes in technology prices might affect economic forecasts, which is part of the FOMC's broader analysis when considering policy decisions. It reflects a balanced view, considering both the risks to economic growth and the potential impact on the FOMC's long-term goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
1,Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Many foreign central banks tightened monetary policy to address high inflation"" describes actions taken by foreign central banks, not the Federal Reserve's policy stance. It does not directly indicate the Federal Reserve's stance on domestic monetary policy, but rather provides context about the global economic environment. The sentence does not suggest whether the FOMC will follow suit or diverge from the actions of foreign central banks, thus it is considered neutral with respect to the FOMC's own policy stance."
2,"A few participants also noted that uncertainty about the extent of resource slack in the economy was considerable and that it was quite possible that the economy could soon be operating close to potential, particularly if labor force participation rates did not turn up much while employment continued to register gains.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there is uncertainty about the current level of resource slack in the economy, which suggests that the FOMC is considering both the possibility of the economy operating close to its potential and the potential for further gains in employment. This reflects a balanced view, as it neither clearly suggests an immediate need to tighten monetary policy (which would be hawkish) nor a need to ease it (which would be dovish). The mention of uncertainty and the potential for labor force participation rates to not increase significantly while employment grows suggests that the FOMC is waiting for more information before deciding on a clear direction for monetary policy."
1,"Holiday shopping reportedly was relatively solid, and, reflecting the improvement in the housing market, demand for home furnishings and construction materials was up.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes positive economic conditions, such as solid holiday shopping and improved demand in the housing market, which are indicative of economic growth. However, it does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of the current economic situation. This type of information would be part of the broader economic analysis the FOMC considers when making policy decisions, but on its own, it does not indicate a clear stance towards a more hawkish or dovish policy direction."
2,"1 The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' projections for economic variables in the long run, assuming a monetary policy that is appropriate and no additional economic shocks. It does not indicate a current stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a neutral, long-term view on where the economy is expected to settle under ideal conditions."
2,The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has decided to maintain a low target range for the federal funds rate, which is a dovish stance. This suggests that the Committee is focused on supporting the economy until it sees improvements in labor market conditions and a sustained rise in inflation to its target level. The commitment to keeping rates low until employment and inflation goals are met implies an accommodative policy to stimulate economic activity and employment, rather than tightening to combat inflation."
1,"The U. S. trade deficit in goods and services widened substantially in January and February from its fourth-quarter average, with exports falling sharply and imports rising strongly.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation regarding the U.S. trade balance without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It provides an economic observation that exports have fallen and imports have risen, leading to a wider trade deficit. This information alone does not indicate whether the FOMC would respond with tightening or easing monetary policy, as it does not directly address inflation or employment levels. The sentence is more about the state of trade and does not inherently suggest a stance on the direction of future monetary policy adjustments."
0,"Partly because of high demand for Treasury securities, the overnight repo rate for Treasury general collateral was near zero for much of the period, and failures to deliver Treasury securities reached record highs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market conditions, specifically the high demand for Treasury securities and the resulting low overnight repo rate, as well as the high number of failures to deliver Treasury securities. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of financial market phenomena. This information might be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy action."
2,The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady"" does not clearly indicate a direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed situation where job growth has decelerated, but the unemployment rate has not increased, suggesting a potentially stable labor market. This could be interpreted as neither a strong signal to increase interest rates (which would be hawkish) nor a clear sign to decrease them (which would be dovish). It presents a balanced view that does not explicitly suggest a change in the current monetary policy stance."
2,"In furtherance of these objectives, the Committee reaffirmed at its meeting in June the ranges it had established in February for growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 2 to 6 percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter of 1998 to the fourth quarter of 1999.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's reaffirmation of target ranges for the growth of monetary aggregates M2 and M3, which is a technical detail of their monetary policy framework. It does not directly indicate a tightening or easing of policy but rather a continuation of previously set targets. The ranges for growth are relatively broad and do not signal a clear move towards either a more aggressive or more accommodative stance. The statement is focused on maintaining the established policy path to achieve the Committee's long-term objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff's estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an expected pattern of economic growth relative to the staff's estimate of potential growth, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It indicates that output is expected to grow slightly above potential in the near term and then slow down, which does not inherently signal a need for either tightening or easing of policy. The statement is simply providing an economic forecast, which is a common component of FOMC statements used to set the context for policy decisions, rather than indicating a clear direction for future policy moves."
2,"While overall employment conditions, the buildup of household net worth, and access to financing would bolster consumer expendi- tures, members also cited a number of limiting factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges both positive and negative factors affecting consumer expenditures, which suggests a balanced view without a clear indication towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The mention of strong employment conditions and increased household net worth could be seen as supportive of consumer spending (potentially inflationary), but this is counterbalanced by the reference to ""a number of limiting factors,"" which implies there are also downside risks to the economic outlook. This balanced perspective does not clearly signal a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"While participants viewed the downside risks to their forecasts of economic activity over the projection period as having diminished, their assessment of the most likely outcomes for economic activity and inflation over the projection period was not greatly changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that while the FOMC participants see fewer downside risks to economic activity, their overall expectations for economic activity and inflation have not significantly changed. This suggests that the FOMC's view on the economic outlook is stable, without a clear indication of a shift towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. The statement reflects a balanced approach, consistent with a neutral monetary policy stance."
0,"The recent decline in mortgage rates had sparked some refinancing and purchase activity, but the extent of the longer-term impact of lower rates on housing demand remained uncertain.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of the housing market's response to lower mortgage rates without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy. It acknowledges a potential positive effect on housing demand due to lower rates, which could be stimulative (dovish), but also expresses uncertainty about the long-term impact, which does not commit to either a tightening or easing stance. The focus on housing demand and mortgage rates is related to economic conditions, but the sentence does not directly suggest any imminent policy action by the FOMC."
0,"Indeed, a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC members expect further disinflation, which suggests a trend toward lower inflation rates. This expectation could lead to a more accommodative monetary policy stance to support economic activity and prevent deflation, aligning with a dovish approach that does not prioritize tightening. The anticipation of disinflation implies that there is less pressure to increase interest rates to curb inflation, which is consistent with a dovish policy stance aimed at stimulating the economy or maintaining current levels of monetary support."
2,"The slower growth of M2 followed strong expansion in August and September, however, and growth since midyear was at about the same pace as in the first half of the year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a factual observation regarding the growth rate of the money supply (M2), noting that it has slowed down but is consistent with the growth rate earlier in the year. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an assessment of economic conditions. This information could be used to inform policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular action."
0,"Some participants judged the risks to the outlook for inflation as tilted to the downside, particularly in the near term, in light of the large amount of resource slack already prevailing in the economy, the significant downside risks to the outlook for real activity, and the possibility that inflation expectations could begin to decline in response to low actual inflation.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that some FOMC participants see a higher likelihood of inflation falling rather than rising, due to factors such as excess capacity in the economy (resource slack), potential declines in economic activity, and the risk of falling inflation expectations. This view suggests that there may be less pressure to raise interest rates, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate the economy and prevent inflation from falling too far below the Committee's target."
2,Members also agreed that there was only a remote possibility that the process of disinflation would cumulate to the point of a decline for an extended period in the general price level.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the FOMC members believe that the likelihood of a deflationary period is low, implying that they are not considering an easing of monetary policy to counteract deflation. Instead, they seem to be focused on the process of disinflation (reducing inflation to a target level), which typically aligns with a tightening stance to ensure that inflation does not exceed their target. This indicates a commitment to preventing high inflation rather than preparing for deflationary pressures, which would require a dovish response."
1,"The recent depreciation of the dollar, while perhaps putting some upward pressure on prices, would damp the deterioration in net U. S. exports.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the depreciation of the dollar has a mixed effect: it may increase prices (which could be inflationary and thus suggest a hawkish stance) but also improve the U.S. trade balance by making exports more competitive (which could support economic growth and suggest a dovish stance). Since the effects are counterbalancing, the overall stance of the sentence is neutral, as it does not clearly lean towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained.","HAWKISH

The sentence ""Nonetheless, the Committee judged that some inflation risks remained"" suggests that the FOMC is concerned about potential inflation. This concern typically indicates a bias towards tightening monetary policy to prevent or curb inflation, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy can involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply, with the goal of maintaining price stability, one of the FOMC's key objectives."
2,The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee is open to changing its monetary policy approach in response to emerging risks that could affect its objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. This statement does not commit to either tightening or easing policy but rather emphasizes flexibility and a data-dependent approach, which is consistent with a neutral stance. It reflects a balanced view that policy could move in either direction depending on how economic indicators align with the FOMC's goals."
2,"In their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead, Committee members generally agreed that their overall assessments of the economic outlook were little changed since their previous meeting.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the Committee members' assessments of the economic outlook have not significantly changed since their previous meeting. This suggests that they are maintaining their current stance on monetary policy rather than signaling a clear move towards tightening or easing. The statement reflects a balanced view consistent with a steady approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,Several members reiterated that business spending was the critical factor that would govern to a substantial degree the timing and extent of the acceleration in overall economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence focuses on the role of business spending in determining the pace of economic activity, without directly suggesting a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It indicates that the FOMC is monitoring economic indicators, such as business investment, to inform their policy decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving their goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"Several participants raised concerns regarding the longer-run effects of the pandemic, including how it could lead to a restructuring in some sectors of the economy that could slow employment growth or could accelerate technological disruption that was likely limiting the pricing power of firms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes concerns about the long-term economic effects of the pandemic, such as potential sectoral restructuring and technological disruption, which could impact employment growth and firms' pricing power. This statement does not directly indicate an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of factors that could influence future policy decisions. It shows the Committee's awareness of the challenges that may affect the economy's performance and their potential implications for employment and inflation, which are key aspects of the FOMC's mandate. However, without a clear indication of how these concerns might translate into policy adjustments, the stance remains neutral."
1,Almost all participants reaffirmed the view that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would likely be consistent with sustaining the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC participants support continued increases in the target range for the federal funds rate. Raising interest rates is a tool used to tighten monetary policy, which is typically done to control inflation and prevent the economy from overheating. The use of ""further gradual increases"" suggests a commitment to a tightening cycle, aligning with a hawkish stance that aims to sustain the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability, especially if inflation is perceived as a potential risk."
1,Most participants continued to think that the cyclical pressures associated with a tightening labor market were likely to show through to higher inflation over the medium term.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that most participants expect higher inflation due to cyclical pressures from a tightening labor market. This expectation of higher inflation suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their long-term target of 2%. Tightening monetary policy is associated with a hawkish stance, as it often involves increasing interest rates to control inflation."
0,"For the present, however, inflation remained subdued, and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is currently low and expected to remain low due to weak commodity and import prices, as well as the influence of current low inflation on future price expectations. This suggests that there is less immediate concern about inflationary pressures, which could imply that there is less need for tightening monetary policy to control inflation. In the context of the FOMC's goals, a dovish stance would support maintaining or easing monetary policy to encourage employment growth without the risk of triggering high inflation."
2,Participants' forecasts for economic growth for 2012 and 2013 were largely unchanged from their January projections and continued to indicate expectations that the recovery will strengthen somewhat over time.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC participants' forecasts for economic growth, which remained consistent with their previous projections, suggesting that they expect a gradual improvement in the economy. This statement does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather conveys a steady outlook on economic recovery. It reflects a balanced view consistent with the FOMC's goals of promoting maximum employment and stable prices without signaling a clear action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where there is an expansion in monetary aggregates due to increased demand for currency and inflows to retail money market funds, which is happening during a period of weakness in the U.S. bond and equity markets. This statement is primarily observational and does not directly indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects the FOMC's monitoring of various economic indicators, which could later influence policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not commit to a specific policy direction."
0,"Long-term government bond yields declined and headline equity indexes increased, on net, in most of these countries, with bank stock prices in the euro area rising more than broader indexes.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market observations regarding bond yields and equity indexes, specifically mentioning the performance of bank stock prices in the euro area. It does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance or an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides a context of the financial environment, which is part of the economic indicators the FOMC might consider when making policy decisions. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any specific action or bias towards a hawkish or dovish stance."
1,The Committee's accompanying statement indicated that economic growth had been quite strong so far this year.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that the economy is experiencing strong growth, which could lead to inflationary pressures. In the context of the FOMC's goals, strong economic growth might prompt the Committee to consider tightening monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
