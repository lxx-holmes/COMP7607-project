1,"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general characteristic of inflation's response to shocks and outlines potential responses by inflation targeters without indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing but rather acknowledges the possible strategies that could be employed in reaction to economic shocks."
0,"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth"" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it describes an economic condition where increased national saving is contributing to economic growth. This statement is more of an observation of economic activity rather than a clear signal of future monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC is leaning towards raising or lowering interest rates or adjusting its monetary policy tools. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
1,"During the period examined, the rate of overall consumer inflation was 2.78 percent, as measured by the regular CPI-U for All Items.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the rate of inflation during a specific period, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). It does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement is a neutral observation and does not suggest a particular policy action. It would require additional context to determine how this rate of inflation compares to the FOMC's target and how it might influence their policy decisions."
1,"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.","HAWKISH

The sentence expresses concern about the potential for a rise in longer-term inflation expectations, which suggests that the FOMC might be inclined to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from becoming entrenched. This stance aligns with the goal of stable prices and indicates a readiness to act against inflationary pressures, which is characteristic of a hawkish policy approach."
2,"At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that future monetary policy decisions will be data-dependent, particularly concerning inflation outlook. It does not explicitly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of policy but rather implies a wait-and-see approach that will be informed by economic indicators as they become available. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence acknowledges the complexity of inflation dynamics and suggests that there are multiple factors influencing inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It does not commit to either a tightening or easing stance but rather reflects a balanced view that there are various elements at play in the inflation process. This suggests that the FOMC is considering all these factors in its policy decisions, consistent with its mandate to maintain stable prices."
1,"As always, my colleagues on the FOMC and I will act to foster our dual objectives of price stability and sustainable economic growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a commitment to the Federal Reserve's dual mandate of price stability and sustainable economic growth without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather a balanced approach to achieving the set goals."
1,"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern for inflation rates potentially exceeding the 2% long-term target by a significant margin (at or above 3%). The speaker's willingness to consider this situation as more than a ""moderate"" overshoot suggests a readiness to tighten monetary policy to bring inflation back towards the target, which is a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce liquidity and cool down inflationary pressures."
2,"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that U.S. policy rate changes in response to inflationary pressures have a significant impact on emerging market (EM) financial conditions. This suggests that when the Federal Reserve increases interest rates to combat inflation (a tightening of monetary policy), it has a notable effect on international markets, which aligns with a hawkish stance. Tightening monetary policy to address inflation is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.","NEUTRAL

The sentence references a historical observation by economist Robert Solow that highlights a discrepancy between the widespread use of computers and the lack of visible impact on productivity statistics during the late 1980s. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral observation on technological impact and does not reflect any immediate implications for monetary policy adjustments."
2,"However, I can provide you with some insight into the way the FOMC functions and the impact of monetary policy on the U.S. and global economies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a general statement about offering insight into the FOMC's operations and the effects of monetary policy on the economy. It does not indicate a specific direction for monetary policy (tightening or easing) and does not provide information on the Committee's stance regarding inflation or employment goals. Therefore, it is considered neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses a concern about the adequacy of current techniques to measure inflation in the future, which is a methodological issue rather than a direct indication of a current stance on monetary policy. It does not suggest any immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather points to the need for accurate data to inform such decisions. The focus is on the reliability of inflation measurement, which is crucial for the FOMC to make informed policy decisions to achieve its goals of stable prices and maximum employment. However, the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific policy direction."
1,"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's commitment to maintaining inflation expectations anchored at the 2 percent target, which is consistent with their long-term goal for price stability. It does not explicitly indicate an immediate direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of managing inflation expectations. The statement reflects a balanced approach to achieving the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, without signaling a clear move towards either more aggressive (hawkish) or more accommodative (dovish) policy actions."
1,"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of stabilizing inflation expectations to prevent them from causing instability but does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the role of monetary policy in maintaining stable inflation expectations, which is a key aspect of the FOMC's mandate for stable prices. However, it does not provide information on current or future policy actions."
2,"Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses).","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests that a monopoly central bank issuing fiat money might not respond optimally during crises or cyclical variations, implying it would prioritize its own income (seigniorage) over minimizing inflation and output losses. This indicates a potential for a tighter monetary policy stance than might be warranted by economic conditions, as the central bank could charge more for liquidity (suggesting higher interest rates) and focus less on the dual mandate of stable prices and maximum employment."
1,"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes both contractionary and expansionary economic effects due to a rise in oil prices, without a clear indication of how the FOMC might adjust monetary policy in response. Lowering real household incomes and demand could be seen as a drag on the economy, suggesting a dovish stance might be appropriate to stimulate demand. However, increased investment in drilling and benefits to oil-producing areas could stimulate parts of the economy, which might suggest a hawkish stance if inflation were a concern. Since the sentence presents a balanced view of the economic impact without a clear direction for monetary policy, it is classified as neutral."
2,A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is speculative and does not indicate a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It poses a question about the potential impact of a certain action on the conduct of monetary policy, without providing information on what that action might be or suggesting a preference for more hawkish or dovish measures. It reflects a neutral stance, focusing on the consideration of policy effectiveness rather than signaling a change in policy direction."
2,"On March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is taking action to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in unlimited amounts to ensure smooth market functioning. This is a form of quantitative easing, which is a monetary policy tool used to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and encouraging lending and investment. By fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions, the FOMC is aiming to ease financial conditions, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to achieve its goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and, hopefully, explain why the value of education, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the importance of education and advanced skills for economic growth, which is a broader economic issue rather than a specific monetary policy action. The focus on education's role in future growth is consistent with the FOMC's long-term goals but does not provide information on immediate policy adjustments."
2,"For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a model linking the behavior of real GDP and key interest rates, which is a technical statement about economic modeling rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's monetary policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest any action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests that the recent spike in inflation is temporary and not widespread across the economy. This implies that the FOMC may not see a need for immediate tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, as it is expected to subside on its own. This stance is dovish because it indicates a leaning towards maintaining or easing the current monetary policy rather than tightening it in response to inflationary pressures."
2,One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence refers to two distinct issues that can affect monetary policy: the zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates, which limits the central bank's ability to use traditional monetary policy tools when rates are near zero, and labor market conditions, which are a key determinant of both inflation and employment. The sentence does not indicate a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather acknowledges challenges that the FOMC must consider in its policy decisions. The mention of the zero bound could imply a constraint on easing policy further, while labor market conditions could signal either a need to tighten or ease policy depending on the specific circumstances. Overall, the sentence is balanced and does not commit to a particular policy stance."
1,"Fast growth of productivity, by buoying expectations of future advances of wages and earnings and thus aggregate demand, enables real interest rates to be higher than would otherwise be the case without restricting economic growth.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that strong productivity growth allows for higher real interest rates without hampering economic growth. Higher real interest rates typically indicate a tightening of monetary policy, which aligns with a hawkish stance. This suggests that the FOMC could raise interest rates to manage inflation expectations and aggregate demand, while still maintaining its commitment to maximum employment and stable prices."
0,"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the state of the U.S. economy, noting the transition from recovery to expansion and reflecting on the rapid and robust recovery in GDP. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather provides an assessment of past economic performance. The statement is factual and does not suggest a particular direction for future monetary policy adjustments."
1,"In addition, though the unemployment rate has fallen since the middle of 2003, the participation rate currently remains near the low point reached in the first half of 2004.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where the unemployment rate has improved but is counterbalanced by a low participation rate, which does not clearly suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy. It reflects a mixed economic situation: while a falling unemployment rate might typically be associated with a potential for inflationary pressure (which could be seen as hawkish), the low participation rate could indicate slack in the labor market (which could be seen as dovish). The sentence does not provide a clear direction on the stance of monetary policy but rather presents a balanced view of labor market conditions."
2,"In practice, the Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the operational approach of the Federal Reserve, mentioning the use of a committee structure and the consideration of various monetary rules in decision-making. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather explains the process by which policy decisions are made. This reflects a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals without a clear directional bias towards either hawkish or dovish policy actions."
1,"There is much about the inflation process that we do not understand, and I have been surprised at the extent of the pickup in core inflation this year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a concern about an unexpected increase in core inflation, which suggests that the FOMC might consider tightening monetary policy to counteract rising inflation and steer it back towards the 2% target. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and could lead to actions such as raising interest rates."
2,"Money versus Interest Rates For most of the post-World War II period, monetary economists have vigorously debated whether the Fed should target money or interest rates in setting policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses a historical debate among economists regarding the Federal Reserve's policy tools and does not directly indicate a current policy stance or a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is a theoretical consideration rather than a statement of action or intent."
0,The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a projection about global economic growth by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance by the Federal Reserve. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide information on employment, inflation, or interest rates in relation to the FOMC's goals. It is a neutral statement that reflects external economic conditions rather than the FOMC's policy intentions."
2,"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.","NEUTRAL

The sentence compares the recent performance of inflation and unemployment with that of the 1970s, without explicitly suggesting a direction for monetary policy adjustments. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides a historical context for the current economic situation. The statement is reflective and does not commit to any particular policy action, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"With tight labor markets and little slack in product markets, we are led to conclude that significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods and services, outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity, will presumably be resisted by higher market interest rates.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about tight labor markets and little slack in product markets, which suggests that the economy is operating near or at full capacity. The mention of ""significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods and services, outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity"" implies that demand is growing faster than the economy's ability to supply goods and services, which can lead to inflationary pressures. The expectation that this will be ""resisted by higher market interest rates"" suggests that the FOMC is prepared to allow or facilitate an increase in interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating, which is a tightening of monetary policy. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices and suggests a hawkish stance to curb potential inflation."
0,"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the relationship between government spending, surplus, and the equilibrium real interest rate in the context of productivity trends. It does not directly indicate a clear intention to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it describes a scenario where fiscal policy (government spending and surplus) could influence the equilibrium real interest rate, which is a factor the FOMC might consider when making monetary policy decisions. The sentence suggests a balancing effect on the real interest rate due to fiscal conditions, which does not inherently signal a move towards either a more hawkish or dovish stance."
1,"The rationale for monetary policy tightening is, in my judgment, quite straightforward and flows from two assessments about the current state of the economy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a justification for tightening monetary policy, which typically means increasing interest rates to control inflation and slow down economic activity. This stance is consistent with a response to an economy that may be overheating or experiencing high inflation, which would require action to achieve the FOMC's goal of stable prices."
1,This automatically pushes up domestic interest rates to support the currency.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that domestic interest rates are being increased to support the currency, which is a form of monetary policy tightening. Raising interest rates is typically a hawkish action as it aims to control inflation and stabilize the currency, often at the expense of potentially slowing down economic growth. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, one of the key aspects of their mandate."
0,"I would like to address two aspects of the issue of underemployment of minorities: first, the implications of ignoring the potential that already exists and, second, the need to encourage young people to seek the types of education and training that will meet the demands of work in the twenty-first century.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the broader issues of underemployment among minorities and the importance of education and training for the future workforce. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on long-term structural issues in the labor market, which are somewhat peripheral to the immediate monetary policy decisions focused on achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses fiscal policy goals related to government budgeting and entitlement program reforms, rather than directly addressing monetary policy or the Federal Reserve's actions regarding the federal funds rate, inflation, or employment. It neither implies a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy but rather focuses on long-term fiscal sustainability, which is outside the direct purview of the FOMC's monetary policy objectives."
2,A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a review of monetary policy framework in light of past lessons and economic developments to better achieve the FOMC's objectives of maximum employment and price stability. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather reflects an ongoing assessment and potential adaptation of policy tools and strategies. The focus is on enhancing the effectiveness of policy in the context of new economic insights, without a clear directional stance on immediate policy changes."
2,"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of how interest rate changes impact various economic factors such as asset prices, household wealth, the exchange value of the dollar, net exports, and import prices. It also compares the effects of short-term rate changes with balance sheet policies, noting that the influence of the federal funds rate is better understood due to extensive historical data. This statement does not explicitly indicate a direction for future monetary policy but rather describes the mechanisms through which monetary policy operates. It reflects an understanding of the tools at the FOMC's disposal and their effects on the economy, without suggesting an imminent policy change."
0,"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses an observation regarding productivity growth in advanced countries compared to the United States, without directly indicating a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it provides context on economic performance, which could be one of many factors considered in the broader analysis of economic conditions."
2,"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where corporate profits are strong and have positively influenced both economists' outlooks and investor behavior, leading to a rise in stock prices. This statement does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing, but rather provides an observation of economic conditions. It does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest any specific monetary policy actions. Therefore, it is classified as neutral."
1,"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that inflation is continuing to rise to levels not seen in 40 years, which is well above the FOMC's long-term target of 2%. This suggests that the FOMC may need to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation and bring it back down to their target level, in line with their commitment to stable prices."
2,"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment but not to target asset prices (or exchange rates).","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on the primary objectives of dealing with inflation and unemployment without directly targeting asset prices or exchange rates. This suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy that does not lean towards tightening or easing based on asset price movements, which is consistent with a neutral stance. The FOMC's primary goals are stable prices and maximum employment, and the sentence reflects a commitment to these goals without indicating a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy action."
2,"Besides influencing the near-term course of important economic variables, such as gross domestic product growth, inflation, and profits, productivity largely determines our society's long-term economic welfare.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of productivity in influencing key economic variables and the long-term economic welfare of society. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides a general statement on the importance of productivity for economic outcomes. The focus on productivity's impact on economic growth and inflation is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices, but it does not suggest any immediate policy action."
2,Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is reflecting on historical periods to draw lessons for current monetary policy management, without indicating a specific direction towards tightening or easing. It suggests a consideration of past experiences to inform present decisions, which is consistent with a balanced approach to policy-making."
2,The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a shift towards a more balanced risk outlook, suggesting neither a clear move towards tightening nor easing of monetary policy. It reflects an assessment of economic conditions that could lead to either policy action depending on how these balanced risks evolve in relation to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
1,This change has led many governments to be more willing to adopt institutional changes to improve central bank governance that have bolstered central bank credibility for maintaining low inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general trend among governments to adopt institutional changes that enhance central bank governance, which in turn strengthens the credibility of central banks in maintaining low inflation. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a broader approach to policy that could support the FOMC's long-term inflation goals. The sentence does not provide specific information on immediate policy actions or intentions to adjust the federal funds rate or other monetary tools."
0,"Although the economy has indeed strengthened over the past few quarters, job growth has been anemic and considerable slack persists in labor markets.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that despite economic strengthening, job growth remains weak and there is significant slack in the labor markets. This suggests that the FOMC may lean towards an easing of monetary policy to stimulate employment, which aligns with a dovish stance. The focus on underperformance in job growth implies that the FOMC might prioritize measures to boost employment, consistent with its mandate of maximum employment."
2,We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of fact regarding the influences on the short end of the yield curve, without indicating a specific direction for future monetary policy. It acknowledges that monetary policy and cyclical factors are key drivers of short-term interest rates but does not suggest whether the FOMC is inclined to tighten or ease monetary policy. The sentence does not directly address the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's stance on adjusting the federal funds rate or other policy measures."
2,And the growth of telegraphy enabled railroads to better coordinate the movement of trains over a wider area.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not provide any direct information about the stance of monetary policy. It is a historical statement about the impact of telegraphy on railroad coordination and does not relate to the current monetary policy objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, or moderate long-term interest rates. It neither suggests a tightening nor an easing of monetary policy."
2,"To be clear, when I say ""risk premium"" I mean the additional compensation required by investors for holding a risky security--that is, one with uncertain returns--above the compensation that would be demanded by risk-neutral investors who care only about expected returns.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a definition of the term ""risk premium"" and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It simply explains a financial concept that could be relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself suggest a policy action or change."
2,Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the role of experienced loan officers in effectively distributing loans to stimulate wealth and growth in the local economy. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it focuses on the qualitative aspect of loan distribution and its potential impact on economic growth, which is more related to banking practices and financial intermediation rather than the FOMC's monetary policy actions."
2,"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential development of financial market instruments and analytical techniques to measure changes in the price level, which is a neutral statement regarding monetary policy stance. It neither directly suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy but rather comments on the ability of markets to discern price level changes. This is more about the financial market's analytical capabilities than the FOMC's monetary policy actions."
2,"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent, although Venezuela provides one counterexample, with a long-term inflation forecast now of 15 percent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an observation about long-term inflation forecasts, noting that most do not exceed 5 percent, except for Venezuela, which is an outlier. This statement does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides context on global inflation expectations. It does not suggest any immediate action or change in policy by the FOMC."
2,"Rather than rely on Fed watchers employed by primary dealers to read the tea leaves of our daily interventions, we inform everyone, openly, and take responsibility for the level of short-term interest rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the Federal Reserve's approach to transparency and communication regarding its daily operations and the setting of short-term interest rates. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the Fed's commitment to clear communication with the public and market participants. This approach is intended to prevent misinterpretation and speculation (reading the tea leaves) about the Fed's actions and policy decisions. The sentence reflects the FOMC's principles of transparency and accountability but does not provide specific information on the direction of monetary policy adjustments."
1,"Although the Fed hasn't started raising rates or reducing the balance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that interest rates have increased, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy. Even though the Fed has not actively raised rates or begun reducing the balance sheet, the observed increase in interest rates can have a similar effect to a hawkish policy stance by making borrowing more expensive and potentially slowing down economic activity to control inflation. This aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, and the movement in interest rates could be a market response in anticipation of future tightening actions by the Fed."
2,"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation with conflicting economic signals: strong private domestic demand versus negative external influences from the Asian crisis. This indicates a balanced view, acknowledging both positive and negative economic factors, without a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The FOMC might be weighing these factors to determine their next move, but the sentence itself does not suggest a specific policy action."
1,This is an example of offsetting the attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a more aggressive response to inflation realizations, which suggests a tightening of monetary policy to address higher inflation. This aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies a priority on controlling inflation, even if it means potentially slowing down economic activity (the output gap). The FOMC would take such a stance if it believes that inflation is deviating above its long-term target of 2%, and thus requires a firmer policy response to ensure price stability, one of its key mandates."
1,Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of the inflation targeting framework without indicating a clear direction for future monetary policy. It simply states that the policy of averaging inflation does not specify the acceptable bounds or duration of inflation above the 2% target, which is a neutral statement regarding the stance of monetary policy. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor an easing (dovish) of policy."
2,"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a biographical statement about Palmer's credentials and her view on the inadequacy of using a single unemployment figure for policy decisions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a perspective on the complexity of labor market indicators, which is relevant to the FOMC's considerations but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
2,"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a consideration of strategies that might involve taking action to correct for previous periods where inflation did not meet the target, suggesting a potential tightening of monetary policy to bring inflation back to the desired level. This reflects a proactive stance on inflation management, which is typically associated with a hawkish approach."
2,"The shift in the stance of monetary policy that we undertook in 2019 was, I believe, well timed and has been providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a retrospective view on past policy actions, indicating that the shift in policy was appropriate for the economic conditions at the time. It suggests that the policy change was supportive of the economy and consistent with the FOMC's goals, but it does not directly signal an intention to either tighten or ease monetary policy in the future. It simply assesses the effectiveness of a past decision rather than indicating a future direction."
0,"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a focus on clarifying the Federal Reserve's communication strategy regarding its employment goals rather than signaling a clear intent to tighten or ease monetary policy. It suggests that the FOMC is considering how to better explain its criteria for judging employment gains, which is a neutral stance in terms of policy direction. The emphasis is on transparency and understanding rather than on immediate policy adjustments."
2,"Median inflation in the nine countries likewise declined, averaging 9-1/2 percent in 1995-99 and 5 percent in 2000-04.Return to text 4.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical data on inflation rates in nine countries, showing a decline over time. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it presents factual information about past inflation trends, which could be used to inform policy decisions but does not in itself suggest a particular direction for policy."
1,"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the positive effects of globalization on the consensus regarding the importance of price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a general belief in the benefits of maintaining stable prices, which aligns with the FOMC's long-term inflation target but does not provide specific guidance on immediate policy actions."
1,Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the real federal funds rate is above its historical average, which suggests that monetary policy is tighter than usual. A higher federal funds rate typically corresponds to a tightening of monetary policy aimed at controlling inflation and slowing down an overheating economy, which aligns with a hawkish stance."
2,Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Now I would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week's FOMC decision.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is an introductory statement that does not provide any specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It simply sets the stage for a discussion on the current economic situation and the recent FOMC decision. It does not indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening, easing, or maintaining its current policy stance."
1,Higher inflation expectations would in turn lead workers to bargain for commensurate raises in nominal wages to preserve the real value of their earnings.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies that inflation expectations are rising, which could lead to an upward spiral of wages and prices. This scenario suggests a potential need for the FOMC to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising above their target level. Tightening monetary policy could involve increasing interest rates to cool down the economy and keep inflation in check, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,Some Reasons for the Decline in Far-Forward Rates Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years?,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about the reasons behind the decline in far-forward rates, which are interest rates expected to prevail in the distant future, as implied by the current term structure of interest rates. This question does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an analysis or inquiry into market dynamics and expectations, which could be part of the FOMC's broader assessment of economic conditions. The sentence does not provide information on the FOMC's policy intentions or its assessment of the economy in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
0,"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario where the growth in the monetary base and M2 (a measure of the money supply) is projected to be in line with the growth in nominal GDP. This indicates a neutral stance as it suggests that the monetary policy is set to neither stimulate nor restrict economic growth, but rather to grow in tandem with the economy, maintaining the balance between money supply and economic output. This alignment with GDP growth does not inherently signal a tightening or easing of policy, but rather a steady approach consistent with the economy's performance."
1,"It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time.","HAWKISH

The sentence emphasizes the importance of price stability as a foundation for efficient resource allocation and achieving maximum sustainable employment. This suggests a focus on controlling inflation, which is typically associated with a tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating. The statement implies a willingness to prioritize inflation control, which is a hawkish stance."
2,"The slowing economy, together with rising interest rates, was in turn a major factor in precipitating the stock market crash.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic observation, noting the relationship between a slowing economy, rising interest rates, and a stock market crash. It does not directly indicate a future policy action or stance by the FOMC, such as tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the consequences of past economic conditions and policy decisions."
2,"From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/4 percent since the end of 2003.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a historical account of productivity growth rates without directly suggesting any immediate action for tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply states a fact about past productivity trends, which does not inherently indicate a stance on the current monetary policy direction. The FOMC might use such data to inform their decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy response."
1,"Petroleum prices have been under particular pressure, reflecting not only stronger demand but also risks that supplies could be constrained by terrorism or political disruption.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates concerns about rising petroleum prices due to increased demand and potential supply constraints caused by terrorism or political disruption. Higher energy prices can lead to inflationary pressures, which the FOMC might counter with a tightening of monetary policy to achieve its goal of stable prices. This suggests a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider raising interest rates or taking other actions to prevent inflation from rising above their target level."
0,There appears to have been some evolution in inflation-targeting regimes toward greater flexibility.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a recognition of changes in the approach to inflation targeting, suggesting a potential shift in how the FOMC might respond to inflation. However, it does not directly imply an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it reflects an observation about policy frameworks, which could be consistent with a balanced approach to achieving the FOMC's goals."
2,Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the extraction of equity from homes, which is a reference to the financial behavior of homeowners rather than a direct indication of the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of policy, nor does it directly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The sentence seems to be more focused on the observation of a financial activity rather than providing guidance on the direction of monetary policy."
0,The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observation of a long-term trend in global financial markets, specifically the decline in global sovereign bond yields, without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate whether the FOMC should tighten or ease monetary policy but rather provides context on the financial environment. The sentence does not explicitly relate to the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it suggest a deviation from the 2% inflation target or a shortfall in employment that would necessitate a policy adjustment."
1,"With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures in consumer goods.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a potential factor that could contribute to reduced inflation pressures, specifically mentioning that a decrease in high retail margins could help ease inflation in consumer goods. This statement does not directly indicate an imminent change in monetary policy but rather discusses a market dynamic that could influence inflation. It neither suggests that the FOMC is planning to tighten nor ease monetary policy but simply provides an observation on how certain economic conditions could affect inflation outcomes."
2,"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects the FOMC's view on inflation expectations and their effect on actual inflation, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests that as long as the public believes inflation will stay low and stable, inflation is likely to remain at those levels, assuming no significant economic shocks occur. This statement is more about the relationship between public expectations and inflation rather than a direct comment on current or future monetary policy actions. It implies that maintaining stable inflation expectations is important for achieving the FOMC's goal of price stability, but it does not signal an immediate need for either tightening or easing of policy."
2,"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the speaker's projection of inflation aligns with the mandate-consistent inflation rate, which suggests that the current macroeconomic environment is in line with the FOMC's long-term inflation target. This implies neither an immediate need to tighten nor ease monetary policy, but rather suggests a stance that is consistent with the FOMC's objectives. The use of the term ""mandate-consistent"" reflects a balance between the goals of maximum employment and stable prices, without indicating a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) policy."
2,"The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad-woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the comparability of commodity prices over time and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an intention to tighten nor ease monetary policy, nor does it provide insight into the FOMC's current assessment of economic conditions in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"More specifically, we observed financial-market developments over the period beginning fifteen minutes before and ending forty-five minutes after each policy decision became known to the public.4 The advantage of restricting the analysis to a short period spanning the Committee's decision is that the changes in yields or asset prices occurring within that narrow window are more likely to reflect the impact of the decision, as opposed to the arrival of other information about the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is describing a methodological approach to analyzing the impact of FOMC policy decisions on financial markets, rather than indicating a direction of policy change. It explains how the Committee assesses the immediate effects of its announcements on financial markets to isolate the impact of its policy decisions from other economic news. This approach does not inherently suggest a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather a focus on understanding the market reactions to policy announcements."
2,"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the release of mortgage price data and concerns about equal access to credit, which is more related to regulatory and supervisory issues rather than the stance of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a move to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it provide clear information on how the FOMC might adjust the federal funds rate in response to changes in employment or inflation."
2,"Progress at Home and Abroad Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that there has been an improvement in inflation and economic activity both domestically and internationally, which suggests a positive economic outlook. However, it does not explicitly signal an immediate need for a change in monetary policy, such as tightening or easing. The improvement could be seen as a result of past policy measures, and the statement does not imply any future actions. It simply acknowledges the current state of economic conditions without a clear direction on policy adjustments."
1,"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates an expectation that the labor market will reach what the speaker considers ""maximum employment"" by the end of 2022, with a projected decline in the unemployment rate to 3.8 percent. This suggests that the labor market is strong and nearing the FOMC's employment goal, which could lead to a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to control inflationary pressures that often accompany low unemployment rates. The focus on reaching a specific unemployment rate threshold aligns with a hawkish stance, as it implies that the FOMC may consider raising interest rates or taking other actions to slow down the economy once this level of employment is achieved."
1,"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.","NEUTRAL

The sentence expresses an individual's belief that quantifying the price stability objective aligns with the current dual mandate of the Federal Reserve, which includes both price stability and maximum employment. However, it also acknowledges the complexity of communicating this change. The statement does not directly indicate a shift towards a tighter or looser monetary policy but rather discusses a matter of policy communication and transparency. It reflects an understanding of the goals and the importance of clarity in conveying policy decisions to the public, without suggesting a specific policy action."
2,"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical observation about the performance of certain economic indicators during the 1990-91 recession. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy tightening or easing but rather reflects on the reliability of past indicators in signaling economic downturns. This type of analysis is part of the FOMC's process in assessing the effectiveness of different economic measures but does not in itself suggest a particular policy direction."
2,"The net effect could be steady, rising, or falling inflation--depending on whether productivity continues to accelerate and on how low the unemployment rate is driven in the process.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a scenario with multiple outcomes for inflation, depending on productivity trends and unemployment levels. It does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather outlines the conditions that could affect inflation. This indicates a balanced view that is contingent on economic indicators, aligning with the FOMC's principle of being responsive to changing economic conditions."
0,"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests a caution against tightening monetary policy in response to temporary fluctuations in inflation, especially when policy rates are already near the lower bound. This implies a preference for maintaining or easing the policy rather than tightening it, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity."
1,"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that with interest rates already low, the central bank has limited room to maneuver in the event of additional negative demand shocks. This suggests a bias towards increasing rates or at least maintaining them at the current level to preserve the ability to cut rates in the future if necessary, which is a tightening stance in monetary policy."
2,"In this environment, America's prospects for economic growth will greatly depend on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology--a quest that inevitably will entail some risk-taking.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the broader economic outlook and the importance of technological development and risk-taking for economic growth. This reflects an understanding of the factors that influence the economy but does not suggest an immediate action or change in monetary policy."
2,"October 12, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting: Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply an introductory remark expressing the speaker's pleasure in participating in the event and does not provide any information on the stance of monetary policy. It does not indicate any intentions to tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it give insights into the FOMC's views on employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle regarding central bank independence and its correlation with lower inflation in developed countries, as supported by economic literature. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects an understanding of the relationship between central bank practices and inflation outcomes, which is relevant to the FOMC's goal of stable prices. However, the sentence itself does not suggest any specific policy action or change."
2,We need to remember that in decades past it was believed that monetary policy was most effective when it was least transparent.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence reflects a historical perspective on monetary policy transparency rather than indicating a current stance on policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor easing of monetary policy but rather comments on past beliefs about the effectiveness of policy communication. It does not directly relate to the current goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, nor does it provide insight into the Committee's current policy direction or its response to economic indicators."
2,"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation on the central bank's influence over monetary services and competition among currencies. It does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation on the structural changes in the financial environment that the central bank operates within. This reflects an understanding of the broader context in which monetary policy is made but does not suggest an immediate policy action to either raise or lower interest rates or to otherwise adjust monetary conditions."
2,"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a positive economic environment with strong performance and credit availability that supports the growth of innovative enterprises. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather provides an observation of the economic conditions. The statement is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices but does not suggest immediate policy action."
2,"October 19, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and Initiatives to Sustain the Flow of Credit to Households and Firms Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is introductory in nature and does not provide specific information about the direction of monetary policy. It sets the stage for a discussion on the economic outlook, monetary policy, and credit initiatives, but does not indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. The sentence merely expresses the speaker's anticipation for the conversation and the topics to be discussed, without revealing any particular policy inclination."
0,"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a commitment to maintaining an accommodative monetary policy stance, which typically involves lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity, until specific employment and inflation conditions are met. The mention of keeping the federal funds rate in the current low range until the labor market reaches maximum employment and inflation exceeds 2% for some time suggests a willingness to tolerate higher inflation in the short term to support economic growth and employment, which aligns with a dovish policy stance. This approach is aimed at easing monetary conditions to support the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a challenge in evaluating the current level of economic slack and acknowledges uncertainty due to differing indicators of excess demand. This statement does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights the complexities in assessing economic conditions, which is a neutral stance. It reflects the FOMC's commitment to considering a range of indicators and balancing risks when making policy decisions."
0,U.S. inflation remains muted.,"DOVISH

The sentence ""U.S. inflation remains muted"" suggests that inflation is not currently a concern as it is low or not accelerating. This could imply that there is less need for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy to combat high inflation, which aligns with a dovish stance that supports maintaining or lowering interest rates to encourage economic growth and employment."
2,The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence simply states a fact about the Federal Reserve's mandate without indicating a direction for future monetary policy. It acknowledges the Fed's role in maintaining price stability, which is one of its key objectives, but does not provide information on whether the policy will be tightened or eased."
2,"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence states a general principle of monetary policy that in the long run, the goals of maximum employment and price stability do not conflict with each other. It does not indicate a current or future direction of policy tightening or easing, but rather affirms the Federal Reserve's long-term objectives. This reflects a balanced view that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening policy) nor dovish (easing policy)."
2,"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the potential effects of a policy option on credit flows and interest rates but does not directly indicate whether the Federal Reserve is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy. It is more focused on the implications of a particular action for the structure of the financial system rather than a clear stance on adjusting the monetary policy to influence inflation or employment."
0,"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an observation about productivity growth without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy. It reflects a positive economic development that could support both price stability and maximum employment in the long term, but it does not explicitly signal an immediate action to tighten or ease monetary policy. The statement acknowledges the strength in productivity growth, which can be beneficial for the economy, but it does not indicate a clear direction for policy adjustment."
2,The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not clearly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It discusses the uncertain impact of a productivity slowdown on employment growth in the medium term, which suggests that the FOMC is considering various outcomes and their potential implications for monetary policy. This reflects a balanced approach, weighing the risks and uncertainties without committing to a specific policy action."
0,"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates an interest in exploring methods to expand the space for targeting interest rates continuously, which includes capping interest rates on Treasury securities and using forward guidance that ties policy rate liftoff to employment and inflation outcomes. This suggests a willingness to keep interest rates lower for longer, depending on economic conditions, which is consistent with a dovish stance that supports easing monetary policy to stimulate economic activity."
2,"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is asking a question about the natural rate of unemployment, which is a theoretical concept representing the lowest level of unemployment that can be sustained without causing inflation to rise. It does not directly indicate a current or future policy action or stance but rather seeks to understand the underlying economic conditions related to the FOMC's goal of maximum employment. This reflects a neutral stance as it does not suggest a move towards either tightening or easing monetary policy."
2,"Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probability distributions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of risk measurement and management, specifically the use of historical market price fluctuations and probability distributions. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it provide information on the FOMC's current or future policy actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates. It is a neutral statement focused on the methodology of risk assessment rather than a signal of monetary policy direction."
0,The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,"DOVISH

The sentence indicates that the Committee is providing a more accommodative policy, which typically means lowering interest rates or implementing measures to stimulate economic activity. This action is taken in response to ""muted inflation pressures,"" suggesting that inflation is below the target level, and to address certain risks to the economic outlook. A dovish stance is associated with easing monetary policy to support employment and economic growth when inflation is not a primary concern."
2,"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Reserve's actions to tighten monetary policy, typically by raising interest rates, have historically led to recessions as a consequence of trying to control inflation. This suggests a stance that prioritizes combating inflation even at the potential cost of economic contraction, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy. Hawkish policies are generally associated with concerns about high inflation and the actions taken to curb it, even if those actions may slow down economic growth."
2,"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the flexibility of a central bank's approach to pursuing price stability in varying circumstances, contrasting it with a bank that has a strict numerical target. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the adaptability of policy frameworks. This adaptability is in line with the FOMC's commitment to adjusting policy as needed to manage economic conditions while striving for its long-term goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"In April, prices of core goods and services--that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy--were unchanged for a second month.","NEUTRAL

The sentence reports a fact about inflation for core goods and services, indicating that there has been no change in prices for two months. This information by itself does not suggest a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It could be interpreted as a sign that inflation pressures are not increasing, which might be seen as dovish, but the absence of price changes could also be consistent with a stable price environment, aligning with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. Without additional context on whether this stability is above or below the targeted inflation rate, or how it relates to employment or other economic indicators, the stance cannot be determined as hawkish or dovish. Therefore, the statement is classified as neutral."
0,The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a historical economic condition where a boom was driven by increased productivity and rising corporate profits, which justified a rise in equity prices. It does not directly indicate a future policy action to tighten or ease monetary policy. Instead, it provides an assessment of past economic factors that influenced market conditions. This statement is more of an analysis of underlying economic strengths rather than a signal of the FOMC's monetary policy stance."
2,"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of how inflation volatility affects nominal bond yields, specifically through the inflation risk premium, without directly suggesting a policy action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It is an observation of market dynamics rather than a statement of policy intent."
2,"However, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates that the long-term inflation expectations have remained stable, neither increasing significantly nor decreasing. This suggests that the current monetary policy stance is effectively anchoring inflation expectations, which aligns with the FOMC's goal of stable prices. The statement does not explicitly suggest an immediate need for either tightening or easing of monetary policy, but rather conveys a sense of ongoing vigilance and satisfaction with the current state of inflation expectations."
0,"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.","NEUTRAL

The sentence simply explains the importance of the goal of maximizing employment without indicating a direction for monetary policy change. It does not provide information on whether the FOMC is considering tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather affirms one of their objectives."
0,This secular decline in term premiums since 1990 appears to be correlated with the decline in long-run inflation uncertainty and in short-term interest rate uncertainty.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an observed correlation between the decline in term premiums and the decrease in long-run inflation uncertainty as well as short-term interest rate uncertainty since 1990. This statement is primarily analytical, reflecting on past financial trends without directly suggesting an immediate action or change in monetary policy. It does not indicate a clear intent to either tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather provides context on market conditions that could influence the FOMC's decisions."
2,"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to a presentation made by two economists regarding stock market valuation, using dividend-price ratios and related measures. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current monetary policy, nor does it suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing by the FOMC. It is merely a statement of fact about a past event and does not reflect on the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates that there are difficulties for corporate borrowers to raise funds at reasonable prices or at all, which suggests a tightening in financial conditions and potential stress in the credit markets. This could imply a need for monetary policy easing to alleviate these conditions and support the flow of credit, which is in line with a dovish stance that favors lower interest rates to stimulate economic activity and achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices."
2,"May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provided is a formal introductory remark expressing gratitude for the opportunity to speak at an event. It does not contain any information about the stance of monetary policy, such as indications of tightening or easing, nor does it discuss the economic outlook or monetary policy actions. Therefore, it does not reflect a hawkish, dovish, or neutral stance on monetary policy but is simply a neutral statement of courtesy."
0,"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.","DOVISH

The sentence implies that the economy is expected to move towards full utilization of its resources without causing an increase in inflation. This suggests that there is room for the economy to grow without the risk of overheating, which could mean that there is less urgency to tighten monetary policy to combat inflation. The use of the word ""gradually"" also indicates a more patient and potentially accommodative stance, aligning with a dovish approach to monetary policy."
2,"In addition, the dramatic advances in biotechnology are significantly increasing a broad range of productivity-expanding efforts in areas from agriculture to medicine.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where technological advances in biotechnology are leading to productivity improvements, which is generally positive for the economy but does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it acknowledges a factor that could influence economic conditions and the FOMC's future decisions. Increased productivity can potentially lead to higher economic growth without additional inflationary pressure, which could be beneficial for achieving the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not specify any particular monetary policy action or direction."
2,"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the limitations of the Federal Reserve's authority and does not directly indicate a stance on tightening or easing monetary policy. It simply clarifies the scope of the Fed's functions, which is unrelated to the immediate direction of monetary policy adjustments."
2,"Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercising the options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a technical statement about how stock options are accounted for in different economic measures: the productivity and cost measure versus the Employment Cost Index (ECI). It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy or suggest any action towards tightening or easing by the Federal Reserve. Instead, it provides information on the methodology of economic data calculation, which is important for understanding the metrics the FOMC might use to assess economic conditions but does not in itself reflect a policy stance."
0,"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a willingness to ease monetary policy by using a full range of tools to support the economy in response to increased downward risks to employment and inflation due to the constraints imposed by the lower bound of interest rates. This suggests a readiness to stimulate the economy if necessary, which aligns with a dovish stance."
1,Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,"HAWKISH

The sentence implies a concern that an active monetary policy aimed at stabilizing financial markets might lead to increased risk-taking, which could result in future financial crises. This suggests a cautious stance towards easing policies, as it acknowledges the potential negative consequences of being too accommodative, which is consistent with a tightening bias or a hawkish view. The focus is on preventing financial instability, which aligns with the goal of maintaining moderate long-term interest rates and could lead to policies that lean towards tightening to mitigate such risks."
2,"Were we to introduce an interest rate rule, how would we judge the meaning of a rule that posits a rate far above or below the current rate?","NEUTRAL

The sentence is exploring the hypothetical implications of introducing an interest rate rule and how to interpret such a rule if it suggests a rate significantly different from the current one. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather discusses a method of policy formulation and its potential interpretation. The focus is on understanding the framework for decision-making rather than signaling an immediate policy direction."
2,"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing a principle from economic literature regarding the appropriate response of policymakers to uncertainty, rather than indicating a current stance on monetary policy. It suggests that when there is uncertainty about the impact of monetary actions, a less aggressive approach to changing economic conditions is warranted. This does not directly indicate whether the current policy is leaning towards tightening or easing, but rather provides a general guideline for policy response in the face of uncertainty."
0,"Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a historical fact about inflation levels in 1996 without providing any direct indication of current or future monetary policy actions. It does not suggest whether the FOMC would tighten or ease monetary policy, nor does it imply a stance on how the FOMC might respond to current economic conditions in relation to its goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides historical context and rationale for the structure of the FOMC, explaining the benefits of a committee approach in terms of information aggregation and diversity of perspectives. It does not directly indicate a stance on the current or future direction of monetary policy, such as tightening or easing, nor does it provide specific information on employment, inflation, or interest rates. Therefore, it is neutral with respect to monetary policy stance."
2,This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand.,"HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a focus on price stability, which is often associated with a restrictive monetary policy stance. This implies a readiness to counteract cyclical increases in demand, which could lead to inflationary pressures. By emphasizing price stability, the FOMC may be signaling a willingness to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflation from rising, aligning with the goal of maintaining stable prices."
2,"For example, although a number of features of Brazilian law promote the independence of the nation's central bank, the bank's de facto independence may be limited by the power of the president to remove members of the Monetary Policy Committee.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the structure and independence of Brazil's central bank, particularly in relation to the president's power over the Monetary Policy Committee. It does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy, nor does it provide information on the central bank's actions regarding employment, inflation, or interest rates. Instead, it focuses on the governance and potential limitations of the central bank's independence, which is a structural and institutional observation rather than a direct comment on monetary policy stance."
2,"Referring to monetary policy developments in the 1980s, Greenspan writes: In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an even more important feature of policy.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a tightening of monetary policy by describing a ""preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures."" This suggests that the FOMC, under Greenspan's leadership in the 1980s, was willing to act in advance of actual inflation to prevent it from rising, which aligns with a hawkish stance that prioritizes controlling inflation over stimulating economic growth."
0,"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a shift in the Federal Reserve's approach to employment, focusing on ""shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than ""deviations."" This suggests a tolerance for lower employment levels without immediately tightening monetary policy, as the emphasis is on avoiding situations where employment is significantly below its maximum potential. This dovish stance implies a willingness to maintain or ease monetary policy to support the labor market until it approaches or reaches maximum employment, consistent with the FOMC's mandate to promote maximum employment."
2,"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the FOMC is placing a high priority on monitoring inflation developments, suggesting that they are prepared to adjust policy to address inflation concerns. This focus on inflation, particularly in the medium term, implies a readiness to tighten monetary policy if inflation is perceived to be deviating from their target, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation related to adjusting the supply of reserves in the banking system due to seasonal fluctuations in demand. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a routine operational consideration to ensure the smooth functioning of the monetary system. This is part of the normal course of central bank operations and does not inherently signal a change in the overall policy stance towards being more hawkish or dovish."
2,"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the FOMC's approach to forecasting the economy's path towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability. It indicates that the forecasts will reflect participants' views on the short-term variability of output and inflation but does not explicitly suggest a tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it emphasizes the Committee's commitment to its dual mandate and the balancing act between different economic variables."
2,"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of financial stability in achieving the Federal Reserve's statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability. It does not directly indicate a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing but rather acknowledges a principle learned from past experience. The focus on financial stability as a prerequisite for the FOMC's goals suggests a balanced approach to monetary policy that is neither explicitly hawkish (tightening) nor dovish (easing)."
0,"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.","DOVISH

The sentence suggests an expectation of economic recovery and a decline in unemployment, which implies that the speaker does not see an immediate need for tightening monetary policy. The anticipation of growth and a better labor market without mentioning concerns about inflation or the need to raise interest rates indicates a stance that is more accommodative or 'dovish.' The focus on recovery aligns with the FOMC's commitment to maximum employment, and the absence of inflation concerns suggests that there is no immediate pressure to tighten policy in response to price stability goals."
2,"At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a process of observation and analysis used to inform monetary policy decisions. It does not indicate a specific direction for policy tightening or easing but rather emphasizes the Committee's approach to understanding economic developments and shaping future policy. The focus is on being data-driven and adaptable, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making based on economic indicators."
2,"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is discussing the valuation of equity markets and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. It suggests that the markets are not overly optimistic about future returns, which does not clearly align with a policy shift to either increase or decrease interest rates. Instead, it provides an assessment of market conditions, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its broader analysis of the economic landscape."
0,"Equity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings ratio further above its historical median (slide).","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a market observation regarding equity prices and does not directly indicate a change in monetary policy stance. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (which would be hawkish) nor does it imply a call for easing (which would be dovish). It simply states a fact about current market conditions without a clear link to the FOMC's policy actions."
2,"This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes volatility as a hindrance to the effective implementation of monetary policy and is taking action to address it. This suggests a stance towards tightening or stabilizing monetary policy to reduce volatility, which aligns with a hawkish approach. The goal is to maintain control over economic fluctuations to achieve their objectives of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. Addressing volatility often involves measures that prevent the economy from overheating, which could include raising interest rates or other contractionary policies."
0,"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) and the profession's emphasis on it, as well as the stability of current estimates and trend growth. It does not directly indicate a shift towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an analysis of economic conditions related to inflation and employment. The focus on NAIRU suggests an ongoing consideration of the balance between employment and inflation, which is consistent with the FOMC's mandate, but the sentence itself does not reveal a clear policy direction."
1,"I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates a clear intention to continue tightening monetary policy through additional rate increases until there is significant progress in reducing inflation. This stance is consistent with a hawkish approach, which focuses on combating inflation, even at the potential cost of slowing down economic growth. The commitment to raising rates until inflation is brought down aligns with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices, specifically targeting a 2% inflation rate over the long term."
2,"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.","NEUTRAL

The sentence suggests a wait-and-see approach, emphasizing the importance of incoming economic data before deciding on any changes to the monetary policy stance. This indicates a balanced view that does not lean towards either tightening or easing monetary policy without further evidence, reflecting a neutral position."
0,"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.","DOVISH

The sentence indicates a concern about inflation rates being persistently below the FOMC's 2% target, which could lead to lower long-term inflation expectations. The mention of ""makeup"" strategies suggests that some economists are advocating for measures to increase inflation to meet the target, which typically involves easing monetary policy. This stance is dovish as it implies a willingness to adopt policies that would stimulate the economy and push inflation towards the desired level."
2,"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a theoretical or empirical relationship between inflation and various economic factors, including lagged inflation, resource utilization, and the relative price of certain imports. It does not directly indicate a current stance on monetary policy or suggest any immediate action to be taken by the FOMC. Instead, it outlines some of the variables that might be considered when the FOMC assesses inflation dynamics, which is part of their mandate to ensure stable prices. The sentence is analytical in nature and does not convey a clear direction towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of central bank independence in the context of achieving price stability, suggesting that a government mandate for price stability can protect the central bank's commitment to this goal. It does not directly indicate a current or future stance on tightening or easing monetary policy but rather emphasizes the importance of a clear objective for the central bank. The focus is on the structural aspect of monetary policy (having a mandate) rather than immediate policy actions."
2,"In contrast, Robert Lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (Lucas, 1972; Sargent and Wallace, 1975).","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a historical reference to the academic views of economists Robert Lucas and others regarding the effectiveness of monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a current stance on tightening or easing monetary policy by the FOMC but rather discusses a theoretical perspective on the limitations of monetary policy in affecting the real economy and its inability to smooth the business cycle. This statement is more about the debate on the role and impact of monetary policy rather than an indication of the FOMC's current policy direction."
1,"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies a preference for proactive tightening of monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, which would lead to longer periods of economic growth without significant fluctuations in output and inflation. This stance aligns with a hawkish approach, as it suggests taking action to avoid excessive economic expansion that could lead to inflationary pressures, thus maintaining price stability—one of the FOMC's key goals."
1,"Central banks have adopted price stability as a key long-term objective, and they have become more transparent and systematic in their operations.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a general approach and philosophy of central banks regarding price stability and operational transparency without indicating a current or future direction of monetary policy tightening or easing. It reflects a commitment to a long-term goal of price stability, which is consistent with the FOMC's mandate, but does not provide specific information on immediate policy actions or stances."
1,The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence ""The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial"" does not directly indicate a future action or stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it reflects a general principle or goal of the Federal Reserve, which is to maintain price stability. Price stability is one of the key mandates of the Federal Reserve, alongside maximum employment. The statement is affirming the importance of this goal without suggesting a particular direction for future policy. It is a neutral comment on the value of one of the Fed's core objectives."
1,"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.","HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that the central bank has raised interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating and to keep inflation in check, which is consistent with a tightening of monetary policy. Raising interest rates is a tool used to cool down economic activity and prevent excessive inflation, aligning with a hawkish stance."
2,"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a statement of financial theory regarding the relationship between the demand for long-term securities and the term premium, rather than a direct indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy. It does not explicitly suggest any action to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather describes a mechanism by which economic conditions can affect financial markets. The term premium is the extra yield that investors require to commit to holding a longer-term bond instead of a series of shorter-term bonds, and changes in net demand for these securities can influence this premium. This understanding is part of the broader economic context in which the FOMC operates, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a particular policy direction."
0,It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the challenges in setting specific targets for unemployment and the uncertainty regarding the extent of asset purchases needed to achieve such a goal. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects on the difficulties in policy planning when dealing with uncertain economic conditions."
2,"Because they cannot rule out the chance that some asset prices might correct more than anticipated, policymakers must consider how the economy might withstand such a correction.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates a cautious approach by policymakers, acknowledging the uncertainty in asset price movements and the need to consider the economy's resilience to potential corrections. It does not directly suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather a consideration of economic stability and the potential impact of external shocks. This stance is consistent with a balanced approach to monetary policy, focusing on assessing risks and maintaining economic stability."
0,The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes an external economic condition related to fiscal policy rather than directly indicating the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy. It mentions the impact of federal tax increases and spending cuts on GDP growth and unemployment, which are factors the FOMC might consider in its policy decisions, but it does not explicitly state what the FOMC's response will be. Therefore, the sentence itself is neutral, as it does not suggest an imminent tightening or easing of monetary policy."
1,"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is considering tightening monetary policy, which is typically associated with increasing interest rates to control inflation and slow down an overheating economy. The reference to ""a more firmly established economic recovery"" suggests that the economy is strong enough to withstand the effects of tighter monetary policy, and the expectation is that the negative impacts on Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) will be offset by the positive effects of increased demand for their exports. This stance is consistent with a move towards a more restrictive monetary policy to ensure stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, aligning with the FOMC's goals when the economy shows signs of strength."
1,The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a consensus view on the relationship between price stability and other monetary policy goals, without indicating a specific direction for future monetary policy actions. It neither suggests an imminent tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of policy but rather acknowledges a general principle agreed upon by economists and central bankers. This principle aligns with the FOMC's long-term commitment to stable prices as one of its key objectives, which is consistent with its mandate for maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the nature of monetary policy as a broad tool that affects the overall economy rather than being able to target specific sectors or regions. It does not directly indicate an intention to tighten or ease monetary policy, but rather acknowledges a characteristic of how monetary policy functions. This statement is more about the limitations of monetary policy tools and does not provide a clear direction on the future stance of policy with respect to employment, inflation, or interest rates."
2,Among other questions that could be addressed would be how policy actions (as opposed to inflation outcomes) influence expectations and how sensitive Federal Reserve credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is exploring questions about the impact of policy actions on expectations and the Federal Reserve's credibility in relation to inflation targets. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects a consideration of how policy decisions might affect economic perceptions and the Fed's reputation. This suggests a balanced approach to understanding the implications of their actions without a clear direction towards either a hawkish or dovish policy adjustment."
2,"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is a factual statement about the historical composition of America's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth and does not directly indicate a stance on current monetary policy. It neither suggests an immediate need for tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects on the nature of economic growth, which is influenced by various factors, including productivity and technological advancements, rather than just the physical volume of goods produced. This information does not directly inform the FOMC's short-term policy decisions aimed at achieving maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a dynamic where trade expansion influences domestic inflation through the prices of imported goods and competition with imports, which affects the pricing power of domestic producers. This statement is an observation of economic mechanisms rather than a clear indication of a future policy stance. It does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy but rather acknowledges the complexity of factors that can affect inflation."
0,"What I have elsewhere referred to as ""currency competition"" may be a driving force behind these changes in inflation outcomes and expectations and may be reflected in low nominal long-term interest rates and the flattening of yield curves.5 Iâ€™d like to briefly review what I mean by currency competition.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the concept of ""currency competition"" and its potential impact on inflation outcomes, expectations, and long-term interest rates, without indicating a clear direction for monetary policy adjustment. It suggests a consideration of various factors that might influence the economic environment, but it does not explicitly suggest that the FOMC should either tighten or ease monetary policy in response. The focus is on explaining a phenomenon rather than prescribing a policy action."
2,Some occasions call for significant swings in currency or reserves because of seasonal demands for cash and loans.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a situation where adjustments in currency or reserves are made due to seasonal demands, which is a routine aspect of central banking operations to ensure liquidity in the financial system. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather acknowledges the need for operational flexibility in response to predictable, short-term fluctuations in demand for cash and loans. This is part of the normal functioning of the central bank to maintain stability and does not necessarily reflect a change in the overall direction of monetary policy."
0,"In response to an unanticipated movement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded, a small variation in interest rates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation in spending.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a technical aspect of monetary policy implementation rather than signaling a clear intent to tighten or ease policy. It explains that a small adjustment in interest rates could be used to manage the quantity of money in the economy, which is a standard response to fluctuations in spending and money demand. This approach is consistent with the FOMC's goal of maintaining stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates, but it does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a more aggressive or accommodative policy stance."
0,"In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries."" does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It is a statement of fact regarding employment trends in other countries, which does not inherently suggest a particular policy action by the FOMC. The sentence does not provide information on the implications for U.S. monetary policy, inflation, or interest rates, nor does it suggest how the FOMC might respond to such trends. Therefore, it is classified as NEUTRAL."
0,"To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses an economic observation that could potentially impact domestic demand due to the behavior of foreign producers. This statement is more descriptive of economic conditions rather than prescriptive of monetary policy actions. It does not explicitly suggest any adjustments to the federal funds rate or other monetary policy tools to achieve the FOMC's goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2,"Still, if aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply follow the paths that I outlined earlier, the slack in resource utilization should diminish, unit labor costs should begin to move higher, and the underlying rate of inflation should stabilize.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies an expectation of tightening in the labor market and an increase in unit labor costs, which could lead to higher inflation. The mention of diminishing slack in resource utilization and the stabilization of the underlying rate of inflation suggests that the economy is moving towards the FOMC's goals, which may warrant a tightening of monetary policy to prevent overheating and to keep inflation in check. This aligns with a hawkish stance, which is characterized by actions or communications that suggest a move towards higher interest rates or a reduction in monetary policy accommodation."
2,"Between the end of July and the FOMC's September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August.","NEUTRAL

The sentence is simply stating a fact about the schedule of upcoming economic reports and does not in itself indicate a clear direction for monetary policy. It does not suggest whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather indicates that future decisions will be informed by the forthcoming employment and CPI data. The sentence reflects the FOMC's commitment to data-driven decision-making, considering indicators that will help assess progress towards its goals of maximum employment and price stability."
2,"LBOs, and other forms of private equity investment, may force management to implement strategic changes rapidly to restore the firmâ€™s return on equity and boost share prices, in part by increasing financial leverage.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the impact of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) and private equity investment on firm management strategies, including the use of financial leverage to improve return on equity and share prices. It does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy tightening or easing. Instead, it describes a market dynamic related to corporate finance and investment behavior, which is not directly related to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy actions."
2,"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it reflects a consideration of the factors that influence productivity and economic growth, which could eventually impact employment and inflation. The statement is more about the timing and realization of productivity gains from technology investments, which is a longer-term economic consideration rather than an immediate monetary policy action."
2,"Mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and other yields and asset prices moved in sympathy, with important effects on the cost of borrowing and hence, presumably, on aggregate demand.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the relationship between various interest rates and asset prices and their effects on the cost of borrowing and aggregate demand. It does not explicitly indicate whether the FOMC is leaning towards tightening or easing monetary policy, but rather explains the transmission mechanism of how changes in rates can affect the economy. This is a statement of economic observation without a clear policy direction."
0,"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, noting the toll on activity and employment levels, but does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy. It sets the stage for potential policy actions but does not commit to any specific direction, thus maintaining a neutral stance."
2,This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long-run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the importance of understanding changes in the equilibrium real interest rate for effective policy setting, without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It emphasizes the need for informed decision-making based on current economic conditions relative to long-term levels, which is a principle of balanced and responsive monetary policy."
2,"Shortly after 9 a.m. each morning, the Desk staff and staff members at the Board of Governors confer over the phone to discuss their respective estimates of the day's demand for balances as well as to consider factors that may affect supply.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a routine operational procedure regarding the daily assessment of demand and supply for balances by the Desk staff and the Board of Governors. It does not provide any indication of the FOMC's stance on monetary policy tightening or easing, nor does it directly relate to the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. It is simply a statement of process and does not reflect a policy direction."
2,"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the approaches to monetary policymaking, noting a preference for the forecast-based approach over another unspecified method. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather comments on the methodology used in policymaking. The focus on forecasting suggests a data-driven approach to policy decisions, which aligns with the FOMC's commitment to informed decision-making but does not inherently signal a hawkish or dovish direction."
1,"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a characteristic of price dynamics, specifically the asymmetric response of prices to cost shocks, without directly suggesting an immediate action for monetary policy tightening or easing. It acknowledges a phenomenon known as ""sticky prices"" on the downside, which is an observation about how prices behave in the economy. This statement does not explicitly indicate a shift towards a more aggressive (hawkish) or accommodative (dovish) monetary policy stance but rather provides an insight into the challenges the FOMC faces in achieving stable prices."
2,The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a strategy that involves waiting for certain economic conditions to be met (sustained achievement of employment and inflation objectives) before raising interest rates (""liftoff""), combined with a tool to manage interest rates across different maturities (""yield curve caps""). This approach indicates a balanced stance that is neither explicitly tightening (hawkish) nor easing (dovish) monetary policy but rather waiting for specific targets to be reached. It reflects a conditional and measured approach to policy adjustments, which is consistent with a neutral stance."
1,"If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a clear stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it discusses the nature of oil price increases and their potential duration, which is a factor the FOMC might consider in its overall assessment of economic conditions. The sentence suggests that if the demand growth leading to higher oil prices is domestic, the effect on prices might be temporary. This analysis of the cause of inflation does not in itself suggest an immediate action for monetary policy but rather contributes to the broader understanding of inflation dynamics."
0,"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes the benefits of stable inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations on longer-maturity obligations, without directly suggesting a change in monetary policy stance. It reflects a situation where the FOMC's goals of stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates are being met, which does not inherently call for either tightening or easing of policy. The mention of ""more stable inflation"" and ""better-anchored inflation expectations"" indicates that the current policy might be effective in achieving the FOMC's targets, but the sentence does not explicitly advocate for a particular policy action."
2,"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides a general description of the Federal Reserve's responsibilities and does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. It outlines the broad areas of the Fed's duties, including maintaining financial stability, supervising and regulating banking organizations, operating the payment system, and conducting monetary policy aimed at stable prices and maximum employment. The reference to the Fed's response to the events of September 11, 2001, highlights its role in financial stability but does not suggest a current policy direction."
2,Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence is focused on setting the stage for a discussion on productivity and technology developments and does not directly indicate a stance on monetary policy adjustments. It neither suggests an imminent tightening nor an easing of policy but rather seems to be providing context or background for further analysis or discussion on economic factors that could influence future policy decisions."
2,"Using more-conventional specifications of Phillips curves, the research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) and the OECD (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006), as well as Ball (2006), finds that foreign output gaps are not important determinants of domestic inflation.","NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses research findings on the relationship between foreign output gaps and domestic inflation, specifically indicating that foreign output gaps are not significant determinants of domestic inflation. This statement is primarily informational and does not directly suggest a change in monetary policy stance, such as tightening or easing. It reflects an analysis of economic conditions rather than a clear intent to adjust policy in response to those conditions."
2,"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation that align with the median of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), without indicating a clear direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. It suggests an expectation of improvement in labor force participation and employment, as well as a return to pre-cycle peak levels, which is consistent with the FOMC's goals of maximum employment and stable prices. However, the sentence does not explicitly state any intended policy actions to either increase or decrease the level of monetary accommodation, thus it is best classified as NEUTRAL."
0,The tendency may be natural to allow more flexibility when central banks are focused on inflation maintenance than when they seek inflation reduction.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence discusses the general approach of central banks to inflation without indicating a specific direction of policy change. It contrasts two different focuses—maintaining inflation versus reducing it—but does not suggest an imminent action to either tighten or ease monetary policy. It reflects an understanding of the FOMC's principles by acknowledging different strategies in response to inflation levels but does not commit to a particular stance."
2,The Role of Government Policy You will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence does not directly indicate a stance on the tightening or easing of monetary policy. Instead, it references the role of government policy in influencing productivity growth, which is a factor outside the direct scope of the FOMC's monetary policy tools. The sentence neither suggests an imminent policy action nor provides insight into the Committee's view on inflation or employment, which are the primary concerns for determining a hawkish or dovish stance."
2,"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.","NEUTRAL

The sentence ""Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle"" does not explicitly indicate a direction for monetary policy tightening or easing. It is a descriptive statement about the behavior of economic indicators, likely referring to the relationship between inflation and employment in the context of economic cycles. It does not provide information on current economic conditions or the FOMC's policy response, thus it is classified as neutral."
1,"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.","HAWKISH

The sentence suggests a concern that delaying the adjustment towards the neutral interest rate could lead to negative outcomes such as excessive inflation or financial instability. This implies a stance in favor of tightening monetary policy sooner rather than later to mitigate these risks, which aligns with a hawkish approach to monetary policy."
2,"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.","NEUTRAL

The sentence explicitly states that the technical measures being discussed do not equate to a change in the stance of monetary policy. The continuation of implementing policy through adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate indicates a steady approach, without signaling a shift towards either tightening or easing. This suggests a balanced or status quo position in line with their ongoing policy strategy."
2,The presidents' reports often include anecdotal updates from businesses or other sources to provide real-time information on regional economic activity.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a method of gathering information rather than indicating a specific direction for monetary policy. It explains that the presidents' reports include anecdotal evidence to assess regional economic conditions, which is part of the FOMC's process for making informed decisions. This does not directly suggest any action towards tightening or easing monetary policy."
1,"The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary policy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations.1 The global environment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying attention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy.","NEUTRAL

The sentence emphasizes the importance of strong analytical and empirical foundations to understand the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy. It does not directly indicate a future tightening or easing of monetary policy but rather stresses the need for informed decision-making in the context of global economic conditions. The focus is on the importance of research and understanding in policy formulation, which is a neutral stance in terms of immediate policy direction."
0,"Remarkably, 30-year Treasury yields were only slightly lower than 10-year yields throughout the episode, implying that the markets had no confidence that inflation would ever return to 1950s or 1960s levels.","NEUTRAL

The sentence describes market expectations regarding long-term interest rates and inflation, without directly indicating a current or future stance of monetary policy tightening or easing by the FOMC. It reflects market sentiment about inflation expectations rather than a policy action or intention by the Federal Reserve."
2,The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,"NEUTRAL

The sentence describes a review of monetary policy frameworks by the Federal Reserve and the ECB, which is an activity aimed at evaluating and potentially improving how monetary policy is conducted. It does not directly indicate a stance towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather reflects an ongoing process of assessment and correlation between different central banks' policies. This activity is consistent with the FOMC's commitment to transparency and informed decision-making but does not in itself suggest a change in the direction of policy."
0,"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.","NEUTRAL

The sentence provides an analysis of labor market conditions, particularly focusing on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor force participation of prime-age women and the distribution of job losses across industries. It does not directly suggest an immediate action towards tightening or easing monetary policy but rather highlights areas of concern that could have longer-term economic implications. The FOMC may use such information to inform future policy decisions, but the sentence itself does not advocate for a specific monetary policy stance."
2,"In particular, I will focus on liquidity regulation and supervision as well as interactions with monetary policy tools.","NEUTRAL

The sentence does not explicitly indicate a direction for tightening or easing monetary policy. Instead, it refers to a focus on liquidity regulation and supervision, as well as how these areas interact with monetary policy tools. This suggests a commitment to monitoring and adjusting the regulatory and supervisory framework to ensure it supports the broader goals of monetary policy, without signaling a specific policy change towards either more hawkish or dovish stances. It reflects an ongoing attention to the mechanics of policy implementation rather than a shift in policy direction."
1,"For example, wages and prices that are set for some period in the future will of necessity embody the inflation expectations of the parties to the negotiation; increases in expected inflation will thus tend to promote greater actual inflation.","HAWKISH

The sentence implies that rising inflation expectations can lead to higher actual inflation, which suggests a concern for inflationary pressures. This concern typically aligns with a hawkish stance, as the FOMC may consider tightening monetary policy to prevent inflation from escalating and to maintain price stability, one of its key objectives. Tightening monetary policy could involve raising interest rates or taking other actions to reduce the money supply and dampen inflationary pressures."
2,"There is, in my view, a reasonable prospect that each of these two effects will reverse their contributions to inflation over the next couple of years and that balance between them will be important in determining the pattern of core and overall inflation rates.","NEUTRAL

The sentence indicates an expectation that the factors contributing to inflation will reverse over the next few years, suggesting a wait-and-see approach. It does not explicitly signal an immediate intention to tighten or ease monetary policy but rather points to a balanced perspective on future inflation trends. The focus on the balance between factors affecting inflation reflects a neutral stance, as the FOMC appears to be neither particularly concerned about high inflation (which would be hawkish) nor signaling a need for stimulus due to low inflation (which would be dovish)."
1,Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,"HAWKISH

The sentence indicates that there is a concern about the potential conflict between the Federal Reserve's monetary policy and the Treasury's debt management. The concern is that while the Federal Reserve is trying to slow down the economy to a sustainable rate (which is a tightening action, or hawkish stance), the Treasury's reduction in debt supply is causing longer-term rates to decline, which could stimulate the economy instead. This suggests that the Federal Reserve's intention is to tighten monetary policy to prevent the economy from overheating, aligning with a hawkish stance."
